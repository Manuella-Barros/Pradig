I Did It Again\" singer took to Instagram to tell her followers that the news that she got into a fight with her boyfriend was \"fake\" and also seemed to deny reports that she had a \"breakdown\" at the hotel she was staying at on Wednesday night.

They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!! Peace.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, Britney Spears and her boyfriend, Paul Richard Soliz, were staying at the Chateau Marmont when a woman called police claiming that a woman matching Britney's description was harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests.\n\nPolice arrived on scene, but did not see any signs of a disturbance, and left. Sources told TMZ that, after officers arrived, Britney and Paul went to their hotel room, where they allegedly got into a \"fight\" that caused Britney to get hurt.\n\nInsiders told the outlet that Britney made her way out into the hotel room, where she was screaming and \"out of control.\" Hotel guests called the paramedics, fearing that the pop star was having a \"breakdown.\"\n\nAccording to the outlet, the paramedics made contact with Britney - not at her hotel room - but outside the hotel, where she was photographed draped in a blanket and carrying a pillow. Britney reportedly did not get into the ambulance and left with security, leaving Paul Richard Soliz at the hotel.\n\nOn May 1, Britney's lawyers submitted a Stipulated Judgement to a judge. On May 2, a judge signed off on the divorce and declared that Britney and Sam will be legally single as of December 2, 2024, which marks Britney's 43rd birthday.\n\nThe former couple met in 2016 on the set of her \"Slumber Party\" music video and proceeded to date for several years. The two tied the knot in June 2022, only a few months after her controversial 13-year conservatorship was struck down by a judge in November 2021.\n\nHowever, in August 2023, Sam filed for divorce citing \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split. He listed the original date of separation as July 28, 2023; however, according to the latest filing, the date of separation was updated to July 30, 2023.\n\nDue to the prenup, Britney is not going to pay spousal support to Sam Asghari.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristin_myers@theblast.com", "name": "Kristin Myers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Rosengart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathew Rosengart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oops!..._I_Did_It_Again_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oops!...

Britney was also doing cartwheels up and down the hallway and then started screaming that she had hurt herself.'\n\nBritney posted pictures of her swollen ankle. She said she had hurt it 'trying to do a leap' in the room.\n\nIt was originally claimed that Spears had suffered the injury after an altercation with Solis.\n\nSpears and Soliz have been an item since 2022 when he was hired to do maintenance work around her house. She was married to Asghari at the time.\n\nTerms to end that marriage were finally decided on Friday last week with Britney not having to dip into her $60 million fortune due to a prenuptial agreement.\n\nShe and the 30-year-old Iranian-born Asghari will not officially be divorced or seven months.\n\nBritney and Soliz were celebrating the end of that marriage at the famed Chateau - where comedian John Belushi died of a drug overdose in 1982.\n\nSoliz has a long history of run-ins with the law including charges for disturbing the peace, child endangerment and possession of a firearm.\n\nBritney also claimed she was 'set up' by her mother Lynne Spears when paramedics escorted her out of the Chateau Marmont in the early hours of Thursday morning -- sparking concern that the singer is suffering a 'mental health crisis.'\n\nHappier times: Britney is no longer close to her mother Lynne and told fans 'I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!!'\n\nBritney closed out her post by gushing over her longtime attorney, Mathew Rosengart, who she said is 'like a father' to her. She also included a photo of Rosengart\n\nBritney posted grainy video of herself doing cartwheels in 2001 at the time her father Jamie was removed from his position as her conservator\n\nShe sounded tearful as she narrated two Instagram videos that showed off her 'twisted' right ankle that looked painful and swollen.\n\nLike her initial statement on the matter, she claimed that paramedics came to her hotel room 'illegally' and 'caused a huge scene which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice [for my ankle].'\n\nIn her caption, Spears then shifted blame to mom Lynne as she accused the 68-year-old of somehow being 'involved' in the ordeal.\n\n'I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!!' the Toxic hitmaker wrote.\n\nShe continued: 'I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it'\n\nBritney closed out her post by gushing over her longtime attorney, Mathew Rosengart, who she said is 'like a father' to her. She also included a photo of Rosengart.\n\n'Psss this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!'\n\nThe videos shared by Britney were meant to be seen as proof that she had in fact twisted her ankle.\n\nReferring to herself as a 'f***ing idiot,' she explained that she 'tried to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau and I fell, embarrassed myself and that's it.'\n\nShe continued: 'Paramedics came to my door illegally and, of course, cause this huge scene which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice [for my ankle].\n\n'But, yeah, [my twisted ankle] is actually pretty bad but s**t happens,' the star concluded.\n\nShortly after, Britney shockingly shared a video of herself dancing in a sparkly costume and heeled boots at her Thousand Oaks home. It's unclear if the video is new or from Britney's archives.\n\n'Ok I've been messing around and I thought this costume was beautiful !!! I used to do shows in Vegas with two layers of tights on my legs !!!' wrote the star, who famous held a Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood from 2013 to 2017.\n\nShe continued: 'They never let me show my real legs !!! It felt kinda weird and idiotic with a costume on my living room !!!'\n\nBritney then made reference to the late Prince, who famously wore flamboyant outfits on and off the stage.\n\n'Well Prince used to dress up in costumes everyday of his life in his house !!! He used to pick specific dancers to entertain him when he was bored !!! Useless information,' she concluded.\n\nAmid the Chateau Marmont drama, Britney's ex-husband Sam Asghari, 30, posted a 'life update' that showed him smiling and posing shirtless on a hike with his dog.\n\nFans slammed the actor for making the post amid concerns for Britney's mental health and physical wellbeing.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Spears broke her silence after the alleged altercation with Soliz at the Chateau Marmont and declared that she is now moving to Boston.\n\nShortly after the Thursday morning incident, Britney shockingly shared a video of herself dancing in a sparkly costume and heeled boots at her Thousand Oaks home\n\nIt's unclear if the video is new or from Britney's archives\n\n'Ok I've been messing around and I thought this costume was beautiful !!!

PSS ...Not sure why I feel the need to share this ...'\n\nThe star concluded the statement by trying to explain why she felt compelled to explain herself while declaring the new major US city she will be moving to.\n\nBritney continued: 'I guess I'm just a girl and I'm on my period so l'm b****y ... s***!!! I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally.\n\n'They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!!

She did twist her ankle at the hotel and someone from the hotel called the ambulance to ensure that they would not be found liable to any injury she sustained.'\n\nThe source adds: 'When the ambulance come the police come. She was resting when they arrived, hence the blanket and pillow. They examined her and left after determining that it was not serious. Of course she was thrown off by this. And no, she's not moving to Boston.'\n\nA man was seen wheeling a stretcher with the star's belongings on it - with a fire truck also seen at the Hollywood hotel.\n\nSpears also posted a concerning Instagram message, which claimed the photos were of 'body doubles' and said she was 'getting stronger every day.'\n\nSoliz (left) was seen walking alongside a barefoot Spears amid the emergency call\n\nThe 42-year-old pop star took to Instagram on Thursday afternoon to share a lengthy statement with some explosive claims including that the paramedics arrived at her room at the legendary Sunset Boulevard hotel 'illegally'\n\nA man was seen wheeling a stretcher with the star's belongings and medical equipment on it - with a fire truck also seen at the Hollywood hotel\n\nSpears appeared disheveled as she walked out of the hotel in underwear and a blanket\n\nA fire truck was seen pulling a stretcher out at the hotel\n\nSpears wandered in the background with her entourage at the hotel\n\nShe wrote: 'Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!!

However, the pop star was not taking too kindly of the help and wrote that they \" showed up at my door illegally.\"\n\n\"They never came in my room,\" she added, \"but I felt completely harassed.\"\n\nAn eyewitness to the alleged incident told Entertainment Tonight, \"Britney came out with Paul Richard Soliz and some others. Someone gave her a blanket to throw over and she had a pillow covering her front. She took a few steps and turned around and went back, not getting into the stretcher they had brought out.\" It was not confirmed the ambulance was called for Spears, but she was not taken to the hospital.\n\nA source told CNN that Britney is now \"home and safe.\n\nBritney later showed fans her ankle after the incident.\n\n\"F- -- - idiot here tries to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau and I fell and embarrassed myself. That's it,\" Britney says in a video.\n\n\"Paramedics came to my door and, of course, caused this huge scene,\" she continued. \"Which was so unnecessary, and all I needed was ice. It is actually pretty bad, but s-t happens.\"\n\nAbout Britney Spears' Boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz\n\nThe two have been romantically linked for about a year. In September 2023, he told Us Weekly that the singer is a \"phenomenal woman.\"\n\n\"She's a very, very good, positive ... She's a good person,\" he added.\n\nHe also spoke highly of Spear's ex Sam Asghari calling him a \"great guy.\"\n\nSoliz has been charged for multiple misdemeanors including disturbing the peace, child endangerment and driving without a license according to Page Six. The outlet added that he was also arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon and unlawful possession of ammunition in December 2020. Soliz understands that many of Britney's fans are worried for her due to his criminal history but says that those incidents are in the past and that is not who he is as a person.\n\n\"I'm not a bad dude. I understand that things have been said about me in the past, and I have a criminal record -- I get it,\" he explained to to the outlet. \"I'm a working man. I own my own business.

I can confirm no-one was transported. Services left the scene at 1.17am.

They are said to have got into a 'huge physical altercation in which Spears 'may have hurt her leg,' which later proved to be not true.\n\nIt was claimed Spears was 'screaming and out of control in the hallway of her suite' with and 'several guests' thinking she was having a mental breakdown, so paramedics were called.\n\nSpears did not get into an ambulance and is said to have left with her security and without Soliz.\n\nEarlier this year in February, the Toxic hitmaker shut down rumors that she was dating Paul in an Instagram video.\n\nAlongside a reel of the star showing off her dance skills, Spears penned that she is a 'hopeless romantic understanding that being single is awesome.' At the time, an insider had informed Us Weekly that, 'Britney and Paul are definitely together' while adding, 'He's still in the picture.'\n\nAnd last year in September, another insider told DailyMail.com that Britney and Paul aren't dating, but revealed they had a 'short fling.'\n\nSpears also posted a concerning Instagram message, which claimed the photos were of 'body doubles' and said she was 'getting stronger every day'\n\nIn 2008 Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to ex Kevin Federline and she was committed to the psych ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold (pictured)\n\nPaul notably has multiple felonies, according to court documents, such as possession of a fire arm in December 2022 when he was employed by Britney.Also in September 2023, Soliz was seen at the San Fernando Superior Court after allegedly violating his probation (pictured)\n\n'Britney hooked up with him twice and, at the time, [she] did not know about his criminal past. She no longer has any communication with him.'\n\nPaul notably has multiple felonies, according to court documents, such as possession of a fire arm in December 2022 when he was employed by Britney.Also in September 2023, Soliz was seen at the San Fernando Superior Court after allegedly violating his probation.\n\nIn 2007, Britney infamously shaved her head at a hair salon in Tarzana, a suburb of Los Angeles, one day after she left a rehab facility in Antigua. Britney later re-entered treatment.\n\nSpears was entered into the conservatorship on February 1, 2008, with Judge Reva Goetz placing her father, Jamie Spears, and attorney Andrew M. Wallet, as conservators.\n\nThis happened when she refused to relinquish custody of her sons to ex Kevin Federline and she was committed to the psych ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold.\n\nIt began as a temporary arrangement, but became permanent by the end of the year.\n\nIn the years that followed, Britney was deemed well enough to work in what the former estate conservator called a 'hybrid business model' in court papers, but not well enough to control her personal life.\n\nThe estate controlled who her friends were, where she could go and 'logged her every purchase down to a drink from Starbucks,' according to The New York Times.\n\nBritney also told the court she had been forced to use birth control and take medication against her will.\n\nDuring one court appearance, she told the judge, 'Ma'am, my dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship, and my management, who played huge roles in punishing me when I said 'No' [to going on tour] -- Ma'am, they should be in jail.'\n\nShe continued to work and release albums throughout her time in the conservatorship, though she entered a psychiatric ward again in 2019 due to stress from her father Jamie's near-fatal colon rupture.\n\nThere were reports in 2019 that Spears was being held against her will in the conservatorship which gave way to the #FreeBritney movement and the conservatorship ending in November 2021.\n\nIn recent days Spears has finally settled her divorce from third husband Hesam 'Sam' Asghari after a nine-month legal separation and only 14 months of marriage.\n\nSpears attacked a paparazzi car with an umbrella in LA in 2007\n\nThe Baby One More Time hitmaker - who recently deleted her Instagram account as insiders claimed she's 'completely dysfunctional' - branded her estranged sister Jamie Lynn a 'b***h' in a video this week (pictured 2017)\n\nShe also made a pointed statement with her latest book recommendation, posting the cover of Jennette McCurdy 's I'm Glad My Mom Died\n\n'My family hurt me!!! There has been no justice and probably never will be!!!' she wrote, sharing a photo of her back and detailing the nerve damage she's suffered\n\nThe Grammy winner and the 30-year-old Special Ops: Lioness actor are waiting for the judge to sign off on the completed divorce paperwork filed by her powerful attorneys Laura Wasser and Mathew Rosengart.\n\nSam and his lawyer Neal Hirsh decided against contesting the prenuptial agreement, which protects Britney's reported $60M fortune.\n\nSpears also called her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, a 'b***h' in a since-deleted video that had been uploaded to her Instagram stories on Tuesday.\n\nThe Baby One More Time hitmaker - who recently deleted her Instagram account as insiders claimed she's 'completely dysfunctional' - filmed herself while sitting in the passenger seat of a vehicle.\n\nShe was joined by others, including an individual whom she called her assistant, as they headed to go horseback riding.\n\nAt one point during the clip, the songstress brought up camping and after asking the others if they have done so, Britney added, 'My sister did on a TV show!'\n\nThe pop star seemingly was referencing to the Zoey 101 actress's time on U.K.'s reality series titled, I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here - which she appeared in last year in 2023.\n\n'And they bathed her in the jungle, little s**t,' Britney continued. 'She said, 'Bathe me, 'cuz I'm like, stuck in the jungle and I miss my kids. Oh, cater to me.' Little b***h.'\n\nAfter a brief pause, the performer then questioned, 'Now, what would we do in the jungle?'\n\nIn text added towards the bottom of the reel, she also wrote, 'I like talking like my assistant...she's British!!!'\n\n'I wanna be a little b***h and get a bath in the jungle like my sis,' the Toxic singer concluded.\n\nBritney's since-deleted Instagram story comes shortly after Jamie uploaded a cryptic post after the pop singer shockingly settled her $2 million legal battle with father, Jamie Spears, earlier last week.\n\nThe settlement causes Britney to pay her dad's legal bills which amount to $2 million while she receives nothing, according to TMZ.\n\nWith nothing awarded to the Baby One More Time artist, Britney is said to be in a bigger financial hole than before the trial.\n\n'The way I was brought up I was always taught the formative of right and wrong but the very two people who brought me up with that method hurt me!!!' she wrote in Sunday's post. 'I am so lucky to be here!!!\n\n'It's funny 'cus till this very day I haven't told them face to face!!! I text through IG but I honestly believe it will not be so safe if I ever did go face to face so!!!\n\n'The child in me knows they would be destroyed and that's basically it!!!

She's not protected anymore,' claimed the insider.\n\nThe star is also allegedly in danger of blowing her $60million fortune after splashing out over a million dollars for each of her monthly trips to French Polynesia and Hawaii, photos of which she shared on social media.\n\nShe is reportedly spending thousands on private jets and five star resorts for the regular holidays, with an insider claiming: 'She cannot afford this... she is in danger of going broke.'\n\nIn regards to the shock settlement with father Jamie, a source told The Sun that settling was to 'protect her from reliving the traumas of her conservatorship.'\n\n'Her legal team decided the focus should be on \u00adprotecting her from \u00adreliving the traumas of her \u00adconservatorship,' the insider claimed to the outlet.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lynn_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lynn Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Rosengart", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mathew Rosengart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underwear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobiles_L._Rosengart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automobiles L.

A number of public breakdowns ultimately led to her being locked into an almost 14-year-long conservatorship under her father, Jamie Spears.\n\nThe #FreeBritney movement, which started gaining traction in early 2021 thanks to the Hulu documentary \"Framing Britney Spears,\" caused many to reevaluate how the pop star was treated by the press and her family. It helped to spark the end of her conservatorship in November 2021.\n\nEarly on Friday morning, the singer tried to allay concerns by writing in a social media post that she felt \"harassed\" by the paramedics' presence.\n\n\"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!!\" she wrote in a post on Instagram. \"I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday !!!\"\n\nAddressing the incident, she continued: \"I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally.\n\n\"They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!! Peace,\" she added.\n\nET reported that in a different version of her post, which has since been deleted, Spears appeared to deny that the woman in the photographs outside the Chateau Marmont was her, writing: \"Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that.\"\n\nA few hours later, Spears shared a video showing her 42.3 million followers her swollen and bruised ankle, explaining from behind the camera that she had tried \"to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau, and I fell and embarrassed myself, and that's it.\"\n\nIn the post's caption, Spears appeared to accuse her mom, Lynne Spears, of calling the paparazzi on her.\n\n\"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\" she wrote.\n\nThis is not the first time Spears has injured her ankle. In 2020, the pop star posted a video to Instagram of the moment she broke the metatarsal bone in her foot while dancing in her home studio. She was left wearing a cast until it healed.\n\nRepresentatives for Spears and her mom did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Spears suffered an ankle injury in the incident, where she was reportedly acting \"out of control\" in the hotel hallway and screaming to the point that other guests allegedly thought she was having a mental episode. Sources who are reportedly close to the situation are saying this is what the concern has been since the pop star was removed from the conservatorship.\n\nBritney Spears regained her freedom in November 2021, 13 years after Jamie Spears allegedly sat his daughter down and said he was taking over her life. The \"... Baby One More Time\" singer has spoken out about her father's treatment of her during the conservatorship, comparing it to \"sex trafficking,\" but especially since announcing her split from Sam Asghari, there's been concerns about Spears being able to care for herself. One insider told Page Six:\n\nBritney Spears has made several allegations against her family, including horrible treatment under the conservatorship and mishandling of her money. However, some have come forward since Spears regained her freedom to remind people that the conservatorship was in place for a reason. Another source said:\n\nIn addition to the hotel incident -- in which Britney Spears blamed her badly swollen ankle on a fall she took while trying to \"do a leap\" in the living room of her Chateau Marmont suite and was photographed leaving the hotel barefoot wrapped in a hotel blanket -- there's also been concern about the millions of dollars she's dropping on luxurious vacations. A third source warned that we're finally seeing why those protections were in place, saying:\n\nYet another source paints a pretty dire picture of what the future holds when it comes to the 2000s pop princess, because after the court battles, accusations and #FreeBritney movement, it's going to be more difficult than ever to get her the help she needs. She's also more vulnerable to people taking advantage of her, they told Page Six, saying:\n\nBritney Spears' fans certainly hope that's not true, but they have also continued to express concern for the singer, before and after she was released from her father's control. Strange social media behavior has sparked concern several times over the past few years, to the point that fans once called the cops to perform a wellness check on her. Police also visited her in September 2023, after videos of her dancing with knives went viral.\n\nWe'll continue to watch for any new developments out of the Britney camp.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Baby_One_More_Time_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "...Baby One More Time (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears_conservatorship_dispute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears conservatorship dispute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGpPDeSuTzVYAReduorVhP-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!!\" she wrote.\n\n\"I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it,\" she added.\n\nSpears' claim comes as a shock to her fans as there were reports that the star is trying to mend ties with her mom after they were spotted together for her 42nd birthday last year.\n\nBritney also praised her longtime lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, saying he's \"like a father\" to her and \"he got me through last night\".\n\nInitially, it was stated that Spears' suffered ankle injuries after an alleged fight with her on-and-off boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz at a Los Angeles hotel. However, the singer dismissed the reports and said that she fell while attempting to \"do a leap\" in her room. \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!!\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a source close to the singer told Daily Mail that Spears was celebrating the finalisation of her divorce with Sam Asghari in Hollywood.\n\n\"She did twist her ankle at the hotel and someone from the hotel called the ambulance to ensure that they would not be found liable to any injury she sustained,\" the source said.\n\nAlso Read: Britney Spears in intense fight with boyfriend exits hotel barefoot, wrapped in blanket; ambulance called\n\nExpressing shock over Spears' current situation, one of her fans speculated on X that the pop singer was 'probably spiraling' amid mental health issues, adding that \"I honestly don't see this ending well.\"\n\n\"Honestly she probably never should've returned to performing after her 1st breakdown in 2008 or at least have taken several years off to get intensive therapy,\" another fan wrote.\n\nOne admirer stated that ending the conservatorship she was under from 2008 to 2021 was a \"BAD idea\" as it provided her some protection.\n\nOther users expressed disapproval towards the endeavors of the Free Britney movement, with one, stating that the public \"may be watching\" the singer's end.\n\nAnother fan shot back at the Free Britney movement, claiming that it was partly to blame for Spears' present problems.\n\nAccording to TMZ report, paramedics were called because Spears was yelling and acting \"out of control\" in the corridor of her suite, and some of the guests believed she was having a \"mental breakdown.\"\n\nLAPD fire department told Page Six that the ambulance was dispatched to the Los Angeles hotel on Thursday night after they received a 911 call \"reporting an adult female who had been injured.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed.\"\n\nIn a subsequent post, Spears showed off her bruised and swollen foot -- which she asserted was the result of a doomed dance move -- and blamed her estranged mother, Lynne Spears, for stirring up the drama.\n\n\"I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u2640\ufe0f !!!\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Britney feels her mom, 68, had alerted paramedics or leaked the news to the press.\n\nMeanwhile, Britney applauded her attorney, Mathew Rosengart, for helping her through the situation.\n\n\"Psss this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!\" she wrote alongside a snap of the lawyer posing with a wolf.\n\nBritney's fight with Soliz has caused concern for her closest friends. Speaking to Page Six, one pal described the former housekeeper -- who has a criminal record -- as \"bad news from the start.\"\n\nAnother source told us that Britney is \"flexing her freedom and moving on from [ex-husband] Sam [Asghari]\" by dating Soliz, to whom they referred as \"a bad influence.\"\n\nBritney's conservatorship -- which her estranged father, Jamie Spears, established in February 2008 to control her personal, medical and financial affairs -- was terminated in November 2021.\n\nThe \"Crossroads\" star previously said she would like to \"sue [her] family\" for their roles in the restrictive legal arrangement -- especially Lynne, whom she accused of giving Jamie the idea for it alongside former business manager Lou Taylor.\n\nBritney ultimately settled her conservatorship case with Jamie, 71, last week.\n\nAlthough she reportedly must pay her dad's legal bills, a source told Page Six that the \"Woman in Me\" author \"wanted to put everything behind her\" and is happy with the result, which avoids a trial and keeps her out of court.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

News.\n\nBritney Spears will not have to pay spousal support to her third husband Sam Asghari under the terms of their divorce settlement, it has been confirmed\n\nAsghari, 30, posted a 'life update' that showed him smiling and posing shirtless on a hike with his dog. Fans slammed the actor for making the post amid concerns for Britney's mental health and physical wellbeing\n\nShortly after Asghari filed for divorce, it was reported that he would not be able to receive spousal support because of his prenuptial agreement with Spears.\n\nThe agreement allegedly stipulated Asghari would receive '$1 million per every two years' of marriage, up to $10 million after 15 years, a source told Us Weekly.\n\nSince he filed for divorce only 14 months after the wedding, he would be ineligible for any alimony under the terms of such a contract.\n\nMeanwhile, in the early hours of Thursday morning, paramedics escorted Spears out of the Chateau Marmont -- sparking concern that the singer is suffering a 'mental health crisis.'\n\nHours later, the pop star issued a public statement claiming that the drama unfolded after she was 'set up' by her mother Lynne Spears.\n\nSpears sounded tearful as she narrated two Instagram videos that showed off her 'twisted' right ankle that looked painful and swollen.\n\nIt was originally claimed that Spears had suffered the injury after an alleged altercation with her felon 'ex' Paul Richard Soliz at the famed hotel in Los Angeles, but the singer insists that she fell while trying to 'do a leap' in her room.\n\nLike her initial statement on the matter, she claimed that paramedics came to her hotel room 'illegally' and 'caused a huge scene, which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice [for my ankle].'\n\nIn her caption, Spears then shifted blame to mom Lynne as she accused the 68-year-old of somehow being 'involved' in the ordeal.\n\n'I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!!' the Toxic hitmaker wrote.\n\nThis comes as a shock to fans as it was reported late last year that Lynne and Britney were working to 'repair' their relationship as they reunited in December for Britney's 42nd birthday.\n\nSpears claims she was 'set up' by her mother Lynne Spears as she continues to share her truth about what really went down when paramedics escorted her out of the Chateau Marmont -- sparking concern that the singer is suffering a 'mental health crisis'\n\nThe superstar, 42, sounded tearful as she narrated two Instagram videos that showed off her 'twisted' right ankle that looked painful and swollen\n\nShe continued: 'I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it'\n\nBritney closed out her post by gushing over her longtime attorney, Mathew Rosengart, who she said is 'like a father' to her. She also included a photo of Rosengart.\n\n'Psss this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!'\n\nThe videos shared by Britney were meant to be seen as proof that she had in fact twisted her ankle.\n\nReferring to herself as a 'f***ing idiot,' she explained that she 'tried to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau and I fell, embarrassed myself and that's it.'\n\nShe continued: 'Paramedics came to my door illegally and, of course, cause this huge scene which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice [for my ankle].\n\n'But, yeah, [my twisted ankle] is actually pretty bad but s**t happens,' the star concluded.\n\nShortly after, Britney shockingly shared a video of herself dancing in a sparkly costume and heeled boots at her Thousand Oaks home. It's unclear if the video is new or from Britney's archives.\n\n'Ok I've been messing around and I thought this costume was beautiful !!! I used to do shows in Vegas with two layers of tights on my legs !!!' wrote the star, who famous held a Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood from 2013 to 2017.\n\nShe continued: 'They never let me show my real legs !!! It felt kinda weird and idiotic with a costume on my living room !!!'\n\nBritney then made reference to the late Prince, who famously wore flamboyant outfits on and off the stage.\n\n'Well Prince used to dress up in costumes everyday of his life in his house !!! He used to pick specific dancers to entertain him when he was bored !!! Useless information,' she concluded.\n\nIn her caption, Spears then shifted blame to mom Lynne, as she told fans: 'I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!!'\n\nAmidst the Chateau Marmont drama, Britney's ex-husband Sam Asghari, 30, posted a 'life update' that showed him smiling and posing shirtless on a hike with his dog.\n\nFans slammed the actor for making the post amid concerns for Britney's mental health and physical wellbeing.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Spears broke her silence after the alleged altercation with her felon boyfriend at the Chateau Marmont and declared that she is now moving to Boston.\n\nThe pop star took to Instagram to share a lengthy statement with some explosive claims including that the paramedics arrived at her room at the legendary Sunset Boulevard hotel 'illegally.'\n\nBritney closed out her post by gushing over her longtime attorney, Mathew Rosengart, who she said is 'like a father' to her. She also included a photo of Rosengart\n\nShe wrote: 'Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!!\n\n'I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday !!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie [laughing while crying emoji]??? Goddesses out there, I'm reaching my higher power and furthermore, I hope you guys are too!!!\n\n'! need a new toothbrush right now [ two rolling eyes, two laughing while crying, one monkey covering eyes, and one champagne bottle emojis]\n\n'PS ... I need an espresso [six pink rose emojis]!!! PSS ...Not sure why I feel the need to share this ...'\n\nThe star concluded the statement by trying to explain why she felt compelled to explain herself while declaring the new major US city she will be moving to.\n\nBritney continued: 'I guess I'm just a girl and I'm on my period so l'm b****y ... s***!!! I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally.\n\n'They never came in my room but I felt completly harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!! Peace [peace hand sign emoji]'\n\nShortly after, Britney shockingly shared a video of herself dancing in a sparkly costume and heeled boots at her Thousand Oaks home\n\nHowever, a source close to Britney tells DailyMail.com: 'She was out in Hollywood celebrating her divorce finalization. She did twist her ankle at the hotel and someone from the hotel called the ambulance to ensure that they would not be found liable to any injury she sustained.'\n\nThe source adds: 'When the ambulance come the police come. She was resting when they arrived, hence the blanket and pillow. They examined her and left after determining that it was not serious. Of course she was thrown off by this.

Spears is now safely at home after paramedics intervened.\n\nThe altercation resulted in an injury to Spears' foot. Although medical personnel were called to the Chateau Marmont, the singer declined medical treatment. Instead, Spears left the premises independently, carrying a pillow, accompanied by her security team. Her boyfriend remained at the hotel.\n\nSpears took to Instagram later Thursday afternoon to address the situation. She said she twisted her ankle, and paramedics \"showed up at my door illegally.\" She felt \"completely harassed\" and announced her plan to relocate to Boston.\n\nWhile the Los Angeles Fire Department did not disclose Spears' identity as the subject of a 911 call from the Chateau Marmont, a spokesperson confirmed that paramedics had been dispatched to the hotel in response to a report of an injured adult female. The call was received at 12:42 a.m. Whether paramedics could contact the injured individual or offer medical assistance remains uncertain.\n\nNo law enforcement officials were summoned to the scene, and the paramedics concluded their visit and departed by 1:17 a.m. When questioned about Spears' claims on social media, the LAFD declined immediate comment.\n\nThis incident occurs after Spears' finalized divorce from Sam Asghari.

He said the caller did not offer specifics about the injury.\n\n\"At this time it is not clear if the crew encountered the injured person or offered any medical assistance,\" he said, adding that the ambulance left Chateau Marmont at 1:17 a.m. without transporting the person and that there was no law-enforcement response.\n\nHumphrey had no comment on the allegations Spears made on social media.\n\nIn the caption of Spears' Thursday video post, she alleged that her mother, Lynne Spears, was probably involved in the incident, which was documented in part by paparazzi.

Soon after telling fans on Instagram that she twisted her ankle at a Los Angeles hotel -- an incident that resulted in an ambulance responding to the scene early Thursday morning (May 2) -- the pop star shared videos of her injured foot on Instagram, and they aren't for the squeamish at heart.\n\nIn the clips, Spears gives a close-up of the dark, painful bruises covering her right foot, the skin around her ankle visibly swollen. \"It's so bad,\" the musician tells followers from behind the camera. \"F-king idiot here tries to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau and I fell and embarrassed myself. That's it.\"\n\n\"Paramedics came to my door and, of course, caused this huge scene,\" she continued. \"Which was so unnecessary, and all I needed was ice. It is actually pretty bad, but s-t happens.\"\n\nThe pop star also included a photo of her lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, who served as her attorney during her conservatorship termination case in 2021. \"Psss this man is wonderful !!!\" Spears wrote in her caption. \"He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!\"\n\nThe post came a few hours after Spears confirmed in an Instagram statement that she'd twisted her ankle overnight at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, which resulted in an ambulance being dispatched to the hotel. Photos from the scene captured the \"Toxic\" singer exiting the building barefoot alongside rumored boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz.\n\nThe local fire department later confirmed to Billboard that a 911 call requesting aid for an unspecified adult female had been placed around 12:42 a.m., though it wasn't clear whether paramedics ever encountered or treated the injured person. According to the LAFD, the dispatched ambulance left around 1:17 a.m., and there was no law enforcement response to the incident.\n\n\"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!!\" Spears wrote at the time. \"I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday. ...

The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed the dispatch of an ambulance to the location but provided limited details regarding the nature of the injury to Page Six.\n\nBritney Spears, who recently settled her conservatorship case with her father, Jamie Spears, has been seen intermittently with Soliz following her split from ex-husband Sam Asghari. Described as having a \"criminal past\" and deemed \"extremely dangerous\" by some, Soliz has raised red flags among Spears' friends, as per Page Six.\n\nOne source reportedly expressed worry about his impact on Spears as she navigates newfound freedom and moves forward with her life. Despite the controversy surrounding the incident, Spears was safely driven back to her Thousand Oaks, California, home by security.

As per the outlet, Spears' team was reportedly negotiating a new contract with Sony Music that would put her back in charge. People are worried about whether she is in the appropriate position to go forward, however, in the wake of the Chateau Marmont hotel event.\n\nRecently, an insider revealed to the outlet, \"The team has been working on exciting plans but her wellbeing is in the front of their minds, and no one wants to rush.\" In her struggle to escape her conservatorship, which gave her father Jamie control over her life, Britney turned away from music. She made a comeback in 2022, making appearances on two songs: Will.i.am's Mind Your Business earlier this year and Elton John's Hold Me Closer, which reached No. 3. According to TMZ, Spears and her boyfriend got into a heated argument on Wednesday night, to the point that she was on the verge of being taken away in an ambulance.\n\nAccording to witnesses, the pop singer was spotted sobbing uncontrollably and maybe even with wounds on her body. Spears and her boyfriend Paul Soliz were at the Chateau Marmont when someone reported the singer to the police for intimidating and harassing both hotel staff and patrons. Authorities said that the event occurred around 10:30 p.m., but they left the area because they saw no indications of problems.\n\nThe news source said that at around 11:00 p.m., Spears and Paul decided to go to a different hotel, where they reportedly started having violent altercations after continuing to drink and party. According to others who contacted the news outlet, they got into a heated fight when they were in the hotel room, which resulted in Britney hurting her leg. She was 'screaming out of control', leading many to believe that she was experiencing a mental breakdown, necessitating the arrival of paramedics. In a further message posted on Instagram, the singer said that she had just twisted her ankle and thought the paramedics were bothering her.\n\nAs reported by US Magazine, she wrote on Instagram hours after the incident, \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger every day. ... I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came into my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!!\" Paul Richard Soliz, Spears' inconsistent partner, strolled beside her. After her divorce from Sam Asghari, this was her first romantic involvement in the public eye. As per the outlet, Spears and Asghari's divorce was completed nine months after their August 2023 split, the same day as the alleged incident at the hotel. The duo met in May 2023 when he was sent in to take care of her Los Angeles home.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Michaels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Michaels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_Me_Closer_(Elton_John_and_Britney_Spears_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hold Me Closer (Elton John and Britney Spears song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elton John"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will.i.am", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will.i.am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/691471/uploads/8f1ce770-09ed-11ef-afc7-b9eddde30a77_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

But Spears also used her caption to tear into her mother, Lynne Spears, accusing the matriarch of somehow being involved in the situation, which unfolded late Wednesday night and continued into the early morning hours of Thursday.\n\n\"\"I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out,\" Spears said. \"I was set up just like she did way back when !!!\"\n\nPage Six said it's not entirely clear if Spears was blaming her mother for summoning the paramedics from the Los Angeles Fire Department. But Page Six said Spears seemed to be using her Instagram post to blame her mother for alerting the news media to the hotel altercation.\n\nFirst responders rushed to the Chateau Marmont early Thursday morning over a 911 call and other reports, which said that a woman matching Spears description was screaming, \"out of control\" and might be having a mental breakdown. According to Spears, the paramedics came to her suite at the Chateau Marmont, which, she said, \"caused this huge scene\" and \"which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice.\"\n\nIn a second clip, the Grammy winner appeared to cry while comparing her non-injured foot with the swollen one. Spears then accused Lynne Spears of somehow being complicit in the situation.\n\n\"I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!!\" Spears fumed. \"I honestly don't care I will say it!!!\"\n\nWhatever went down, the reports of Spears' \"out-of-control behavior\" at the Chateau Marmont are likely to fuel new speculation that the embattled singer is struggling with another serious mental health crisis, blowing through her fortune or needs a new conservatorship.\n\nTMZ and Page Six reported Thursday that first responders rushed to an incident at the hotel, after Spears got into \"a huge fight\" with her boyfriend, Paul Richard Soliz, which left her crying and possibly injured.\n\nAccording to TMZ, police had been called to the hotel a couple hours earlier, following a disturbance and a report that a woman matching Spears' description was harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests. When officers arrived at 10:30 p.m., they found \"no signs of trouble\" and left, TMZ said.\n\nAt 11 p.m., Spears and Soliz retreated to a hotel room where they continued to party and to drink, TMZ reported. While in the hotel room, the couple got into an altercation that \"turned physical.\" During this altercation, Spears may have cut her leg.\n\nBecause Spears was screaming and \"out of control\" in the hallway of her suite, several guests grew alarmed that she was having a mental breakdown so paramedics were called, TMZ said.\n\nA Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson confirmed to Page Six that it received a 911 call from the hotel, reporting that an adult female had been injured.\n\n\"The caller did not have much information regarding the nature of the injury,\" the spokesperson, Brian Humphrey, told Page Six. One ambulance was dispatched to the hotel and was on scene until about 1:17 a.m.\n\nHumphrey said it was not clear whether first responders offered any treatment, but notes that they \"did not transport anyone to the hospital.\"\n\nTMZ reported that a tearful-looking Spears left the hotel on her own accord, with photos published on the site showing the singer walking out with a pillow and a blanket wrapped around her. She did not get into the ambulance and left with her security -- and without Soliz, TMZ said.\n\nSpears reportedly ended up back home, \"safe,\" at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, Page Six said. A source told the outlet: \"She is home and fine.\"\n\nThis reported altercation involving Soliz, her former housekeeper, took place shortly after the singer settled her divorce from ex-husband Sam Asghari, Page Six said. Compared with all the other drama in Spears' life, her 14-month marriage to Asghari ended relatively peacefully. The couple called it quits in August 2023.\n\n\"Britney is continuing to turn the page,\" a source told Page Six early Thursday. Spears also recently reached a settlement with her estranged father, Jamie Spears, over her controversial 13-year conservatorship.\n\nJamie Spears oversaw the conservatorship, which the Grammy winner described as \"abusive.\" A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge terminated the conservatorship in November 2021.\n\nBut in recent weeks, TMZ and Page Six have reported that Spears has been freely spending money from her $60 million fortune, splurging on lavish vacations and other extravagances.\n\n\"She has no concept of money,\" one insider told Page Six. \"For over a decade, other people were in charge of her bank accounts, and every purchase had to be reported to the court -- even if it was just a pack of gum. But now, she's on her own.\"\n\nHowever, sources close to the situation denied to Page Six that Spears was close to \"going broke.\" Then again, TMZ shared an alarming assessment on Spears' mental health from Charles Sophy, a high-profile Los Angeles psychiatrist who is the former medical director for the County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services.\n\nSophy, who is not treating Spears, opined on an episode of \"TMZ Live\" that the pop star appears to be \"slowly unraveling,\" given reports of her excessive spending and the \"erratic,\" \"manic\" behavior she displays on social media and elsewhere. Sophy said the conservatorship had been in place for a reason, even if her father wasn't the best person to administer it.\n\n\"With a mental illness to this degree, you need that kind of supervision and structure,\" Sophy told TMZ. He also believes that Spears is not taking her medication -- and she needs it, he said. \"She's out of control on many levels,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelandenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sentinel and Enterprise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@sentinelandenterprise.com", "name": "Martha Ross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Fire_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Fire Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-again,_off-again_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-again, off-again relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Oaks,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ENTER-MUS-SPEARS-SISTER-GET-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It gave her father Jamie Spears control over every aspect of her life - with the Princess of Pop facing restrictions on her spending, her visitors, and even the kind of phone she could have.\n\nThe conservatorship was terminated in 2021, after 13 years, and Britney is now largely free to make her own decisions about her life. But some sources have now voiced fears for the singer's mental health after reports that Britney was injured following an explosive fight after she was seen being escorted out of Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, California barefoot with her hair messed up. In the shocking pictures, the 42-year-old was seen wearing next to no clothing and covering herself up with a blanket and pillow.\n\nREAD MORE: Britney Spears shows off swollen ankle and blames mother after ambulance rushed to LA hotel\n\nBritney Spears with her father Jamie, brother Bryan and mother Lynne\n\nShe sparked major concern among her fans and sources from the hotel claimed they feared she was experiencing a mental breakdown similar to the one she had back in 2007 before she was placed under a conservatorship. But the singer insisted she had only twisted her ankle and claimed there was no cause for concern.\n\nThe pop star posted two videos on her Instagram on Thursday night showing off her swollen ankle and blaming her mother for what happened. In the caption, Britney wrote: \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!!\" She continued: \"I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nWhile showing off her swollen ankle and foot, which also looked bruised, fans could hear Britney crying while explaining what happened. She told her Instagram followers that she \"really twisted her ankle last night like an idiot.\" She revealed that the injury came from trying to do a leap in the living room and she fell.\n\nBritney Spears blamed her mother for the incident The singer and her mum in happier times\n\nTo the singer it was \"so bad\" and she said she \"embarrassed\" herself. She also mentioned how the paramedics came and caused a huge scene, \"which was so unnecessary\" and all she needed was ice.\n\nAfter the LA pictures emerged, sources told Page Six they feared for Britney and argued that she should have remained in a conservatorship. A source said: \"I hate to say it, but the way this is all going - this is what we feared.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nLast month, Britney's legal argument that her father had fleeced her out of millions was settled, with the singer paying Jamie's estimated $2million legal fees. But an insider familiar with the court case and the internet campaign to #FreeBritney told Page Six: \"The narrative of Britney having been locked away for no good reason other than her dad being evil and wanting to work her for every last penny has always been wrong.\n\n\"There is no question that Jamie Spears is a flawed father and the way that Britney was put to work in Vegas was awful. It should never have happened. However, there is also no question that the conservatorship - and the interventions prior to it - happened for a reason and it wasn't because her dad wanted to make some nefarious money grab. It was put in place because Britney has serious mental health issues and was going completely off the rails.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears_conservatorship_dispute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears conservatorship dispute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32735680.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britney-Spears.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

I can confirm that no one was transported. Services left the scene at 1:17 a.m. The police department was not called,\" he said.\n\nMany expressed worries about her mental health after the pictures of her from the hotel went viral.\n\nSpears and Soliz allegedly had a \"short fling,\" and she was unaware of his criminal history. Their report read, \"Paul notably has multiple felonies, according to court documents, such as possession of a firearm in December 2022 when he was employed by Britney. Also in September 2023, Soliz was seen at the San Fernando Superior Court after allegedly violating his probation.\"\n\nThis incident reminded me of the time Britney Spears was checked into Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre's psychiatric ward in 2008.\n\nTags: Britney Spears, Britney Spears Guardianship, Celebrity Gossip, Instagram, trending Sanskriti", "source": {"uri": "womansera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "womansera.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyfriend_(Justin_Bieber_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boyfriend (Justin Bieber song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Fire_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Fire Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_superior_courts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California superior courts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gossip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Fernando Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://womansera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture4-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The heartfelt tribute comes in the wake of Britney's reported altercation with her boyfriend, Paul Richard Soliz, at Chateau Marmont.\n\nJamie Lynn shared a touching message on her Instagram Story, accompanied by a photo of Lynne with her granddaughters Maddie and Ivey. The 'Zoey 101' alum praised her mother's childlike spirit, describing her as a source of magic in their lives and expressing gratitude for her presence.\n\nWhile Lynne seemed to spend her birthday in Los Angeles, arriving at LAX late Friday, it remains unclear if she spent the day alongside Britney amidst the tumultuous events. Lynne gracefully evaded paparazzi inquiries about Britney, affirming her unwavering support for her eldest daughter, as per Page Six.\n\nThe chaos unfolded at Chateau Marmont when paramedics were called to Britney's hotel room after an alleged altercation with the singer's alleged beau, Soliz. Photos from the scene depict Britney covering her face while exiting the hotel, as first responders attended to the situation.\n\nDespite the commotion, Britney was reported to be safe at home following the incident. Britney herself attempted to debunk rumours of a fight, attributing her injuries to a mishap while attempting a leap in the living room.\n\nIn an Instagram post, she expressed frustration with the response from paramedics and accused her mother of involvement in the incident, alleging she was set up. In the aftermath of Britney's tirade, concerns have been raised about her mental health and financial decisions.\n\nSources suggest fears of substance abuse and reckless spending, highlighting the ongoing challenges Britney faces even after the termination of her 13-year conservatorship in November 2021, as per Page Six. While Britney enjoys newfound freedom and control over her finances, questions linger about her ability to manage her wealth responsibly.\n\nDespite the complexities surrounding her situation, insiders emphasised the importance of considering Britney's mental health needs and ensuring she receives appropriate support and guidance in navigating her post-conservatorship life, in a statement obtained by Page Six.

When officers arrived at 10:30 p.m., they found \"no signs of trouble\" and left, TMZ said.\n\nAt 11 p.m., Spears and Soliz retreated to a hotel room where they continued to party and to drink, TMZ reported. While in the hotel room, the couple got into an altercation that \"turned physical.\" During this altercation, Spears may have cut her leg.\n\nBecause Spears was screaming and \"out of control\" in the hallway of her suite, several guests grew alarmed that she was having a mental breakdown so paramedics were called, TMZ said.\n\nA Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson confirmed to Page Six that it received a 911 call from the hotel, reporting that an adult female had been injured.\n\n\"The caller did not have much information regarding the nature of the injury,\" the spokesperson, Brian Humphrey, told Page Six. One ambulance was dispatched to the hotel and was on scene until about 1:17 a.m.\n\nHumphrey said it was not clear whether first responders offered any treatment, but notes that they \"did not transport anyone to the hospital.\"\n\nTMZ reported that a tearful-looking Spears left the hotel on her own accord, with photos published on the site showing the singer walking out with a pillow and a blanket wrapped around her. She did not get into the ambulance and left with her security -- and without Soliz, TMZ said.\n\nSpears reportedly ended up back home, \"safe,\" at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, Page Six said. A source told the outlet: \"She is home and fine.\"\n\nThis reported altercation involving Soliz, her former housekeeper, took place shortly after the singer settled her divorce from ex-husband Sam Asghari, Page Six said. Compared with all the other drama in Spears' life, her 14-month marriage to Asghari ended relatively peacefully. The couple called it quits in August 2023.\n\n\"Britney is continuing to turn the page,\" a source told Page Six early Thursday. Spears also recently reached a settlement with her estranged father, Jamie Spears, over her controversial 13-year conservatorship.\n\nJamie Spears oversaw the conservatorship, which the Grammy winner described as \"abusive.\" A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge terminated the conservatorship in November 2021.\n\nBut in recent weeks, TMZ and Page Six have reported that Spears has been freely spending money from her $60 million fortune, splurging on lavish vacations and other extravagances.\n\n\"She has no concept of money,\" one insider told Page Six. \"For over a decade, other people were in charge of her bank accounts, and every purchase had to be reported to the court -- even if it was just a pack of gum. But now, she's on her own.\"\n\nHowever, sources close to the situation denied to Page Six that Spears was close to \"going broke.\" Then again, TMZ shared an alarming assessment on Spears' mental health from Charles Sophy, a high-profile Los Angeles psychiatrist who is the former medical director for the County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services.\n\nSophy, who is not treating Spears, opined on an episode of \"TMZ Live\" that the pop star appears to be \"slowly unraveling,\" given reports of her excessive spending and the \"erratic,\" \"manic\" behavior she displays on social media and elsewhere. Sophy said the conservatorship had been in place for a reason, even if her father wasn't the best person to administer it.\n\n\"With a mental illness to this degree, you need that kind of supervision and structure,\" Sophy told TMZ. He also believes that Spears is not taking her medication -- and she needs it, he said. \"She's out of control on many levels,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Fire_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Fire Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-again,_off-again_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-again, off-again relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Oaks,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ENTER-MUS-SPEARS-SISTER-GET-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The singer has changed her story three times in two days, and fans believe she is starting to panic. The first time Britney spoke out about the incident, she claimed the news and the photos were fake. She stated that it was not her but that of a body double.\n\nThe second time Britney spoke out, she once again called the reports fake news. She also claims she will soon leave California and head to Boston. However, today is another day, and another version of Britney Spears's hotel meltdown story comes with it. Britney now states that she has been set up by her mother, Lynne Spears.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the singer took to Instagram again to tell her side of things. She posted a video showing a badly bruised and swollen ankle while accusing Lynne Spears of allegedly setting her up.\n\nShe says \"I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! Really, I honestly don't care I will say it.\" Britney closed her post by gushing over her longtime attorney, Mathew Rosengart, who she said is 'like a father' to her.\n\nShe also included a photo of Rosengart. 'Psss, this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me, and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you, mister Mathew !!!' However, now there is a new twist, and Britney will not be happy.\n\nSources close to Britney Spears say the singer was celebrating her divorce when her night turned wrong. But it looks like things may get worse for her. She is angry at her mom, but Lynne Spears claims she'll 'Always be there for her daughter.' Lynne arrived at LAX early Friday afternoon. She was spotted with Britney's brother, Bryan.\n\nFans believe that once Britney is aware that her mom and her brother are together, she may go off the deep end. They believe the singer will panic, thinking her family is in cahoots, and want to force her into treatment.\n\nThere is no proof that Lynne Spears is in LA on Britney's behalf. However, considering the singer's experience with her family members, it is easy to see how she could be on high alert. This story changes daily, and Britney Spears fans admit they are concerned. They say they only want to see Britney thrive and wish her the best. The singer is going through something.

A three-time weekly dose of divas, drag queens, hot male celebrities, models, & pop culture news. Get it in your inbox.\n\nWhat is going on with Britney Spears, people? Spears has taken to social media to address concerns over her well-being after an ambulance was called to the West Hollywood hotel where she was staying.\n\nMultiple sources reported that on Friday (May. 03, 2024), Spears was seen barefoot outside the Chateau Marmont after an ambulance had responded to a medical incident at the hotel.\n\nPaparazzi photos published by TMZ show Spears, 42, wearing just a pair of shorts, with a blanket wrapped around her, clutching a pillow in her arms.\n\nPaul Richard Soliz, 37, was photographed standing fully dressed beside Spears, wearing a flannel shirt, black jeans, a cap, and sneakers, amid rumors that he was her former housekeeper and boyfriend.\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported that first responders visited the hotel on the Sunset Strip after the Los Angeles Fire Department received a 911 call at around 12:42 a.m. requesting aid for an injured adult female.\n\nAccording to an LAFD spokesperson, the paramedic crew departed the Chateau Marmont just over 30 minutes later, at 1:17 a.m., with an empty ambulance, as no one required transport to a hospital.\n\nThe spokesperson added that there was no law enforcement response to the call.\n\nThe incident happened the same week she reached a divorce settlement with her estranged husband, Sam Asghari, days after she reached a separate settlement with her estranged father.\n\nMany people will certainly be reminded of Britney Spears' encounters with the paparazzi in the 2000s, including the night in 2007 when she shaved her head. A series of public meltdowns eventually resulted in her being placed under a conservatorship that has been controlled by her father, Jamie Spears, for almost 14 years.\n\nEarly on Friday morning, the singer tried to allay concerns by writing in a social media post that she felt \"harassed\" by the paramedics' presence.\n\n\"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!!\" she wrote in a post on Instagram. \"I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday !!!\"\n\nAddressing the incident, she continued: \"I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally.\n\n\"They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!! Peace,\" she added.\n\nET reported that in a different version of her post, which has since been deleted, Spears appeared to deny that the woman in the photographs outside the Chateau Marmont was her, writing: \"Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that.\"\n\nA few hours later, Spears shared a video showing her 42.3 million followers her swollen and bruised ankle, explaining from behind the camera that she had tried \"to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau, and I fell and embarrassed myself, and that's it.\"\n\nIn the post's caption, Spears appeared to accuse her mom, Lynne Spears, of calling the paparazzi on her.\n\n\"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\" she wrote.\n\nThis is not the first time Spears has injured her ankle. In 2020, the pop star posted a video to Instagram of the moment she broke the metatarsal bone in her foot while dancing in her home studio.

It gave her father Jamie Spears control over every aspect of her life - with the Princess of Pop facing restrictions on her spending, her visitors, and even the kind of phone she could have.\n\nThe conservatorship was terminated in 2021, after 13 years, and Britney is now largely free to make her own decisions about her life.\n\nBut some sources have now voiced fears for the singer's mental health after reports that Britney was injured following an explosive fight after she was seen being escorted out of Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, California barefoot with her hair messed up.\n\nIn the shocking pictures, the 42-year-old was seen wearing next to no clothing and covering herself up with a blanket and pillow.\n\nShe sparked major concern among her fans and sources from the hotel claimed they feared she was experiencing a mental breakdown similar to the one she had back in 2007 before she was placed under a conservatorship. But the singer insisted she had only twisted her ankle and claimed there was no cause for concern.\n\nThe pop star posted two videos on her Instagram on Thursday night showing off her swollen ankle and blaming her mother for what happened.\n\nIn the caption, Britney wrote: \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!!\" She continued: \"I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nWhile showing off her swollen ankle and foot, which also looked bruised, fans could hear Britney crying while explaining what happened.\n\nShe told her Instagram followers that she \"really twisted her ankle last night like an idiot.\"\n\nShe revealed that the injury came from trying to do a leap in the living room and she fell.\n\nTo the singer it was \"so bad\" and she said she \"embarrassed\" herself. She also mentioned how the paramedics came and caused a huge scene, \"which was so unnecessary\" and all she needed was ice.\n\nAfter the LA pictures emerged, sources told Page Six they feared for Britney and argued that she should have remained in a conservatorship.\n\nA source said: \"I hate to say it, but the way this is all going - this is what we feared.\"\n\n\"The narrative of Britney having been locked away for no good reason other than her dad being evil and wanting to work her for every last penny has always been wrong.\n\n\"There is no question that Jamie Spears is a flawed father and the way that Britney was put to work in Vegas was awful. It should never have happened.\n\nHowever, there is also no question that the conservatorship - and the interventions prior to it - happened for a reason and it wasn't because her dad wanted to make some nefarious money grab. It was put in place because Britney has serious mental health issues and was going completely off the rails.\"", "source": {"uri": "newzimbabwe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewZimbabwe.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barefoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Professional_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Professional Resources", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Mental Health", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

She did twist her ankle at the hotel and someone from the hotel called the ambulance to ensure that they would not be found liable to any injury she sustained.'\n\nThe source adds: 'When the ambulance come the police come. She was resting when they arrived, hence the blanket and pillow. They examined her and left after determining that it was not serious. Of course she was thrown off by this.

I can confirm no-one was transported. Services left the scene at 1.17am. The police department were not called.'\n\nTMZ reports Spears arrived at the hotel late Wednesday night - with police called after a 'disturbance' with a woman matching the singer's description reportedly 'harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests.'\n\nAttending officers found no signs of trouble and left.\n\nThe pair then returned to their room around 11pm where they 'partied and drank.' They are said to have got into a 'huge physical altercation in which Spears 'may have hurt her leg.'\n\nIt was claimed Spears was 'screaming and out of control in the hallway of her suite' with and 'several guests' thinking she was having a mental breakdown, so paramedics were called.\n\nSpears did not get into an ambulance and is said to have left with her security and without Soliz.\n\nEarlier this year in February, the Toxic hitmaker shut down rumors that she was dating Paul in an Instagram video.\n\nAlongside a reel of the star showing off her dance skills, Spears penned that she is a 'hopeless romantic understanding that being single is awesome.' At the time, an insider had informed Us Weekly that, 'Britney and Paul are definitely together' while adding, 'He's still in the picture.'\n\nAnd last year in September, another insider told DailyMail.com that Britney and Paul aren't dating, but revealed they had a 'short fling.'\n\nSpears also posted a concerning Instagram message, which claimed the photos were of 'body doubles' and said she was 'getting stronger every day'\n\nIn 2008 Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to ex Kevin Federline and she was committed to the psych ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold (pictured)\n\nPaul notably has multiple felonies, according to court documents, such as possession of a fire arm in December 2022 when he was employed by Britney.Also in September 2023, Soliz was seen at the San Fernando Superior Court after allegedly violating his probation (pictured)\n\n'Britney hooked up with him twice and, at the time, [she] did not know about his criminal past. She no longer has any communication with him.'\n\nPaul notably has multiple felonies, according to court documents, such as possession of a fire arm in December 2022 when he was employed by Britney.Also in September 2023, Soliz was seen at the San Fernando Superior Court after allegedly violating his probation.\n\nIn 2007, Britney infamously shaved her head at a hair salon in Tarzana, a suburb of Los Angeles, one day after she left a rehab facility in Antigua. Britney later re-entered treatment.\n\nSpears was entered into the conservatorship on February 1, 2008, with Judge Reva Goetz placing her father, Jamie Spears, and attorney Andrew M. Wallet, as conservators.\n\nThis happened when she refused to relinquish custody of her sons to ex Kevin Federline and she was committed to the psych ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold.\n\nIt began as a temporary arrangement, but became permanent by the end of the year.\n\nIn the years that followed, Britney was deemed well enough to work in what the former estate conservator called a 'hybrid business model' in court papers, but not well enough to control her personal life.\n\nThe estate controlled who her friends were, where she could go and 'logged her every purchase down to a drink from Starbucks,' according to The New York Times.\n\nBritney also told the court she had been forced to use birth control and take medication against her will.\n\nDuring one court appearance, she told the judge, 'Ma'am, my dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship, and my management, who played huge roles in punishing me when I said 'No' [to going on tour] -- Ma'am, they should be in jail.'\n\nShe continued to work and release albums throughout her time in the conservatorship, though she entered a psychiatric ward again in 2019 due to stress from her father Jamie's near-fatal colon rupture.\n\nThere were reports in 2019 that Spears was being held against her will in the conservatorship which gave way to the #FreeBritney movement and the conservatorship ending in November 2021.\n\nIn recent days Spears has finally settled her divorce from third husband Hesam 'Sam' Asghari after a nine-month legal separation and only 14 months of marriage.\n\nSpears attacked a paparazzi car with an umbrella in LA in 2007\n\nThe Baby One More Time hitmaker - who recently deleted her Instagram account as insiders claimed she's 'completely dysfunctional' - branded her estranged sister Jamie Lynn a 'b***h' in a video this week (pictured 2017)\n\nShe also made a pointed statement with her latest book recommendation, posting the cover of Jennette McCurdy 's I'm Glad My Mom Died\n\n'My family hurt me!!! There has been no justice and probably never will be!!!' she wrote, sharing a photo of her back and detailing the nerve damage she's suffered\n\nThe Grammy winner and the 30-year-old Special Ops: Lioness actor are waiting for the judge to sign off on the completed divorce paperwork filed by her powerful attorneys Laura Wasser and Mathew Rosengart.\n\nSam and his lawyer Neal Hirsh decided against contesting the prenuptial agreement, which protects Britney's reported $60M fortune.\n\nSpears also called her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, a 'b***h' in a since-deleted video that had been uploaded to her Instagram stories on Tuesday.\n\nThe Baby One More Time hitmaker - who recently deleted her Instagram account as insiders claimed she's 'completely dysfunctional' - filmed herself while sitting in the passenger seat of a vehicle.\n\nShe was joined by others, including an individual whom she called her assistant, as they headed to go horseback riding.\n\nAt one point during the clip, the songstress brought up camping and after asking the others if they have done so, Britney added, 'My sister did on a TV show!'\n\nThe pop star seemingly was referencing to the Zoey 101 actress's time on U.K.'s reality series titled, I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here - which she appeared in last year in 2023.\n\n'And they bathed her in the jungle, little s**t,' Britney continued. 'She said, 'Bathe me, 'cuz I'm like, stuck in the jungle and I miss my kids. Oh, cater to me.' Little b***h.'\n\nAfter a brief pause, the performer then questioned, 'Now, what would we do in the jungle?'\n\nIn text added towards the bottom of the reel, she also wrote, 'I like talking like my assistant...she's British!!!'\n\n'I wanna be a little b***h and get a bath in the jungle like my sis,' the Toxic singer concluded.\n\nBritney's since-deleted Instagram story comes shortly after Jamie uploaded a cryptic post after the pop singer shockingly settled her $2 million legal battle with father, Jamie Spears, earlier last week.\n\nThe settlement causes Britney to pay her dad's legal bills which amount to $2 million while she receives nothing, according to TMZ.\n\nWith nothing awarded to the Baby One More Time artist, Britney is said to be in a bigger financial hole than before the trial.\n\n'The way I was brought up I was always taught the formative of right and wrong but the very two people who brought me up with that method hurt me!!!' she wrote in Sunday's post. 'I am so lucky to be here!!!\n\n'It's funny 'cus till this very day I haven't told them face to face!!! I text through IG but I honestly believe it will not be so safe if I ever did go face to face so!!!\n\n'The child in me knows they would be destroyed and that's basically it!!!

She was allegedly \"out of control, crying, possibly cut, and almost driven away in an ambulance,\" TMZ reported.\n\nAfter arriving at the hotel that night, Britney allegedly caused a disturbance that led to authorities being called, according to TMZ. Guests claimed that a woman matching the \"Toxic\" singer's description was harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests,\" the outlet reported. However, officers arrived on the scene at 10:30 p.m. and left soon after because they saw no signs of trouble.\n\nBritney and Paul reportedly \"retreated\" to their room around 11 p.m. and continued partying but then allegedly got into a fight that became physical, TMZ reported. Britney was allegedly heard screaming in the hallway, which prompted hotel guests to call an ambulance because they feared that someone was \"injured,\" a source told the outlet. Paramedics made contact with the singer at 12:40 a.m.\n\nThe Crossroads star was later photographed outside the hotel with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders and a pillow in her arms. She had seemingly been crying and reportedly left the Chateau Marmont with her security team, but without Paul.\n\nBritney addressed the reports about the alleged fight in an Instagram post on May 2, writing, \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake!!! Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\"\n\nShe later added, \"I also twisted my ankle and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston!! Peace.\"\n\nThe singer also claimed that her mom, Lynne Spears, was \"involved\" in the incident. \"I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out,\" she wrote. \"I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!!

Blames mother for setting her up. Read her clarification statements here.\n\nA week after making the headlines for settling the conservatorship dispute with her father Jamie Spears for good, Britney Spears is once more in the news. Recent pictures of the popstar storming out of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles in a \"terrible state\" have gone viral on social media, leaving fans concerned about her well-being.\n\nAs per reports, the singer was photographed storming out of the LA hotel after an alleged heated fight with her on-again, off-again boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz. The incident, which took place on Wednesday night, sees Britney barefoot and wrapped in a blanket. The singer - who appears to be topless under the blanket, looked distressed as she held a white pillow close to her chest. Surrounded by security, a paramedic's personal can also be seen in the media.\n\nAs per a TMZ report, Britney Spears was screaming and 'out of control' in the hallway of her suite. Several guests thought she was having 'a mental breakdown' and hence so paramedics were called to the hotel. A Las Angelas fire department spokesperson confirmed to Page Six that an ambulance was called, but no one was transported in it.\n\nSoon after reports surfaced online of Britney allegedly suffering a mental breakdown and pictures of her barefoot, clad in a blanket outside an LA hotel went viral, the singer posted a lengthy note dismissing them. Taking to her Instagram handle, the 'Toxic' singer shared, \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake!!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!!!\"\n\nShe continued, \"Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie??? Goddesses out there, I'm reaching my higher power and furthermore, I hope you guys are too!!! I need a new toothbrush right now!!! PS: I need an espresso!!! PSS: Not sure why I feel the need to share this... I guess I'm just a girl and I'm on my period so I'm b*tchy... sh*t!!! (sic).\" Talking about the paramedics who arrived for her at the LA hotel, the singer wrote, \"I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room, but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston. Peace.\"\n\nHours after the lengthy post, Britney Spears also shared a couple of videos showing her swollen ankle. Blaming her mother for it all, the 'Oops!...I Did It Again' singer wrote, \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!! She continued, \"I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\" Talking about the man in the image, she wrote, \"Psss this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!\n\nMoments later, she shared a video of her dancing in a shiny concert bodysuit. She captioned it, \"Ok I've been messing around and I thought this costume was beautiful !!! I used to do shows in Vegas with two layers of tights on my legs !!! They never let me show my real legs !!! It felt kinda weird and idiotic with a costume on my living room !!! Well, Prince used to dress up in costumes everyday of his life in his house !!!

The Toxic singer is grappling to maintain stability in her life, a struggle that was painfully evident in her recent breakdown at a luxurious LA hotel. She is in dire need of assistance, and the one person she had trusted to provide support is allegedly leading her down a dangerous path.\n\nBritney Spears's life is in turmoil, and her boyfriend, Paul Soliz, looks to be a significant contributor. New details on the singer's Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles, California, continue to emerge. While much information points to Britney Spears allegedly suffering a breakdown, there looks to be a scary reason behind it.\n\nPage Six reports that Britney's current boyfriend, Paul Soliz, is not a good fit for her. The website reveals that Soliz has a history of anger issues that Briteny has attempted to cover up. Wednesday's volatile confrontation between the couple is not an isolated incident. The couple reportedly have a long history of volatile arguments that lead to costly destruction, which Britney Spears is paying for.\n\nJust four months before the Chateau Marmont Hotel drama, Paul Soliz is reported to have trashed a Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel during an explosive argument with Britney. Paul Soliz reportedly ransacked a room at the Wynn Hotel last December during an intense fight with the singer that cost her tens of thousands of dollars to rectify. He also borrowed Britney's Mercedes during the Vegas outing and caused massive damage to the vehicle.\n\nThere is a lot of concern for Britney right now. The singer spoke out about the LA incident. However, she is causing a lot of confusion. She claims the reports are fake news and that her mom, Lynne Spears, set her up.\n\nLynne arrived in LA on Friday and was greeted by Britney's brother Bryan. Many of her fans believe Lynne rushed to town to devise a plan of action to save Britney before things got completely out of control.\n\nThere are no confirmations on why Lynne is in LA during her daughter's current drama. Britney has been raging on Instagram. However, she has turned the comment function off. Fans claim they are worried and want to see the singer get the help she allegedly needs. They believe Paul is a danger to Britney and could bleed her dry financially as well. The entire situation is a sad mess.

This is heartbreaking to him. Sam is a helper and was there for her in her hardest times.

This comes in the wake of a reported incident involving Spears and Soliz at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, where paramedics responded less than 48 hours prior.\n\nIn the Instagram post, Spears, 42, captioned the video with a playful reference to Pink's song, stating, \"As Pink says, 'Embracing the fall' !!!\" alongside the footage of her bruised foot. The clip showcased a significant size difference between her injured foot, nearly double in size, and her uninjured one, accompanied by visible bruises around the ankle, heel, and toes.\n\nAddressing her followers, Spears expressed, \"I guess it's a little bit bigger today. It's really swollen,\" as she zoomed in on her twisted ankle. She recounted how she had \"twisted my ankle last night like an idiot,\" attempting a leap in the living room of the Chateau Marmont, leading to embarrassment and the need for medical attention.\n\nSpears clarified that despite the paramedics' response, the situation was merely a result of her own clumsiness and not an altercation with Soliz. However, she seemed to suggest her estranged mother, Lynne Spears, might have been involved, insinuating that her mother had contacted the press or alerted emergency services.\n\nThe incident has sparked concern among friends of the singer, particularly regarding her relationship with Soliz, whom she began dating in August 2023 amidst her divorce from Sam Asghari. Sources close to Spears have expressed apprehension over her involvement with Soliz, describing him as \"bad news from the start\" and \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\nThis incident unfolded shortly after Spears finalized her divorce from Asghari, indicating a tumultuous period in her personal life.

She was also said to have injured her leg during that altercation. In the photos, the pop star is seen clutching a pillow with a blanket draped over her shoulders. She also appeared to be crying. Now, Spears is making bizarre claims that the photos were staged using a body double.\n\nAfter the news of Britney Spears' incident was reported, fans began to send her well wishes. Sadly, mental breakdown rumors and other health speculation began to circulate. As many fans know, the singer has struggled with her mental health in the past. This time, she's claiming that the rumors aren't true and that a doppelganger posed for the heartbreaking photos.\n\n\"Just to let people know...the news is fake!!! Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that!!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!!!\" Spears said via her Instagram account, per The Mirror.\n\nJust before the hotel mishap, Dr. Charles Sophy told TMZ that he believed that Britney Spears was in need of medication. He also shared his opinion that another conservatorship would likely be good for Spears. Fans are concerned for the singer, and are hoping that she can get whatever help she needs during this difficult time.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_lynne@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Amanda Lynne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg\u00e4nger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doppelg\u00e4nger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/britney-spears-pic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

However, now that the pop sensation is free to make all her own decisions, sources claim her mental health is suffering.\n\nRecent photos of Britney being escorted out from a Los Angeles hotel after reportedly being injured in a fight have sparked concern amongst fans, the Mirror reports. Barefoot, with messed-up hair and wearing barely any clothing, the star left the Chateau Marmont hotel and later claimed that she had only 'twisted her ankle'.\n\nHowever, sources are worried that she could be experiencing another mental breakdown similar to the one she suffered in 2007 that led to her conservatorship.\n\nTaking to Instagram earlier this week, Britney posted a video showing off her swollen ankle and blamed her mother, writing: \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!!\" She continued: \"I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nIn tears, Britney told followers that she had \"really twisted her ankle last night like an idiot.\" She revealed that the injury came from trying to do a leap in the living room and she fell.\n\nTo the singer it was \"so bad\" and she said she \"embarrassed\" herself. She also mentioned how the paramedics came and caused a huge scene, \"which was so unnecessary\" and all she needed was ice.\n\nIn the aftermath, a source close to Britney told Page Six they were concerned for her wellbeing - even arguing that her conservatorship should have been kept in place.\n\nThey admitted: \"I hate to say it, but the way this is all going - this is what we feared.\"\n\nBritney paid an estimated $2m in legal fees to her father last month following claims that he'd fleeced her out of millions. However, an insider revealed to Page Six said the narrative of her dad being 'evil' and 'locking her away' was incorrect.\n\nThey said: \"There is no question that Jamie Spears is a flawed father and the way that Britney was put to work in Vegas was awful. It should never have happened. However, there is also no question that the conservatorship - and the interventions prior to it - happened for a reason and it wasn't because her dad wanted to make some nefarious money grab. It was put in place because Britney has serious mental health issues and was going completely off the rails.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

There were no cuts and no scratches.\"\n\nSpears took to social media before and after the Chateau Marmont incident on Thursday posting two very similar statements.\n\n\"Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that!!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!!!\" she wrote alongside a since-deleted Instagram pic of a male shirtless model. \"Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\"\n\nShe went on to write: \"Goddesses out there, I'm reaching my higher power and furthermore, I hope you guys are too!!!

She was seen being escorted out of the hotel barefoot with her hair messed up.\n\nBritney accused her mum Lynne Spears of being involved and has since taken to Instagram to share a message with fans. \"Don't ever lose sleep over people who ruined your dreams - Britney Spears,\" she wrote on a pink background.

Lynne arrived in LA less than 24 hours after the incident.\n\nShe was seen pushing a suitcase through the airport and was picked up by her son Bryan Spears and her granddaughter Sophia Alexandra Spears. Britney had taken to Instagram on Thursday night, sharing two videos that showcased her swollen and bruised ankle.

Log in.\n\nSpears' former housekeeper and rumored boyfriend, Paul Richard Soliz, 37, was photographed standing beside her fully dressed wearing a flannel shirt, black jeans, a cap, and sneakers.\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported that first responders visited the hotel on the Sunset Strip after the Los Angeles Fire Department received a 911 call at around 12:42 a.m. requesting aid for an injured adult female.\n\nAccording to a LAFD spokesperson, the paramedic crew departed the Chateau Marmont just over 30 minutes later at 1:17 a.m. with an empty ambulance, as no one required transport to a hospital.\n\nThe spokesperson added that there was no law enforcement response to the call.\n\nThe incident happened the same week she reached a divorce settlement with her estranged husband, Sam Asghari, days after she reached a separate settlement with her estranged father.\n\nSpears' appearance will undoubtedly remind many of her run-ins with the paparazzi in the '00s, including the night she shaved her head in 2007. A number of public breakdowns ultimately led to her being locked into an almost 14-year-long conservatorship under her father, Jamie Spears.\n\nThe #FreeBritney movement, which started gaining traction in early 2021 thanks to the Hulu documentary \"Framing Britney Spears,\" caused many to reevaluate how the pop star was treated by the press and her family. It helped to spark the end of her conservatorship in November 2021.\n\nEarly on Friday morning, the singer tried to allay concerns by writing in a social media post that she felt \"harassed\" by the paramedics' presence.\n\n\"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!!\" she wrote in a post on Instagram. \"I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday !!!\"\n\nAddressing the incident, she continued: \"I also twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally.\n\n\"They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!! Peace,\" she added.\n\nET reported that in a different version of her post, which has since been deleted, Spears appeared to deny that the woman in the photographs outside the Chateau Marmont was her, writing: \"Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that.\"\n\nA few hours later, Spears shared a video showing her 42.3 million followers her swollen and bruised ankle, explaining from behind the camera that she had tried \"to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau, and I fell and embarrassed myself, and that's it.\"\n\nIn the post's caption, Spears appeared to accuse her mom, Lynne Spears, of calling the paparazzi on her.\n\n\"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\" she wrote.\n\nThis is not the first time Spears has injured her ankle. In 2020, the pop star posted a video to Instagram of the moment she broke the metatarsal bone in her foot while dancing in her home studio. She was left wearing a cast until it healed.\n\nRepresentatives for Spears and her mom did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

She was photographed with the paramedics -- wearing a blanket wrapped around her and a pillow in front of her body. Before first responders were called to the scene, the couple allegedly caused a huge disturbance at the establishment. A woman matching Britney's description was allegedly harassing and threatening people inside the hotel, resulting in the cops being called. However, the police left without taking any legal action since they couldn't corroborate those claims.\n\nRelated: Britney Spears & BF Paul Richard Soliz Trashed Vegas Hotel Room With Heated Fight!\n\nHours later, Britney and Paul allegedly got into a massive fight. She started screaming in the hallway at one point, leading hotel guests and employees to dial 911 a second time. That's when the paramedics showed up to help an \"injured\" female. It's unclear how Britney hurt herself -- though sources claimed the accident happened when she did a cartwheel in the hallway during the fight.\n\nAfter the drama went down, Sam posted a shirtless picture of himself smiling while hiking. Given he dropped the \"life update\" photo as Britney's experiencing a tough time, many slammed him for being smug and insensitive toward his ex-wife.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Sam Asghari (@samasghari)\n\nSam hasn't addressed the backlash. However, a source came forward to tell Us Weekly on Friday that the fitness trainer is upset for Britney after the \"heartbreaking\" incident:\n\n\"Sam will always have a soft spot for Britney and will always be protective over her. Sam is a helper and was there for her in her hardest times. He hopes she is OK.\"\n\nWhile the former couple \"don't communicate anymore,\" the insider said Sam thought the situation was \"definitely worrisome\" since police were called to the hotel. The source added:\n\n\"Sam has been down this road with Britney before and knows how she is.\"\n\nFurthermore, he \"feels terrible if she is not surrounded by positive people in her life.\" And he's not the only one! As we previously reported, Britney's pals are \"concerned\" about her new man and don't feel like Paul's a positive influence in her life after the hotel incident, even going as far as to call him \"extremely dangerous.\" What's worse, this is not the first time Paul and Britney fought at hotel! Yikes...\n\nWhile Sam and Britney aren't together anymore, the US source insisted he \"will always wish [Spears] the best and would be there for her if she needed him.\" Hmm. Are you buying, Perezcious readers? Especially after that eyebrow raising post amid her drama?

This comes after her sister Jamie Lynn Spears appeared to take a swipe at Britney.\n\nJamie Lynn shared a heartfelt birthday tribute to their mother, Lynne Spears, on her Instagram Story. She posted a picture of Lynne with Jamie Lynn's two daughters, Maddie Briann Aldridge and Ivey Joan Watson, captioning it: \"Happy birthday to my beautiful mama. She has a childlike spirit that brings magic to everything she does, and we are so blessed to have her.\"\n\nShortly after, Britney posted a nostalgic photo of herself holding one of her sons. The pop star shares two sons, Jayden James and Sean Preston Federline, with her ex-husband Kevin Federline.\n\nThe legendary pop star, Britney Spears, is sadly estranged from her sons, who are living with their father in Hawaii. In 2022, their dad Kevin revealed that Sean and Preston hadn't seen their mum for months and chose not to attend her wedding to Sam Asghari, reports the Mirror.\n\nSean and Preston then publicly asked their mum to stop posting risque videos on Instagram. Responding to their comments, Britney said she \"gave them everything\" and was \"saddened\" by their words.\n\nBritney's mum, Lynne, was spotted arriving in Los Angeles over the weekend following the singer's recent hotel drama. Lynne landed in LA less than a day after the incident.\n\nShe was pictured at the airport, wheeling a suitcase and soon picked up by her son Bryan Spears and her granddaughter Sophia Alexandra Spears. Britney took to Instagram last Thursday night, sharing two harrowing videos of her swollen and bruised ankle.\n\nIn the post, she pointed fingers at her mother for what happened, writing: \"I know my mom was involved ! ! ! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out ! ! !

Lynne Spears has expressed her endless support for her daughter as she traveled to Los Angeles, one day after the pop icon was allegedly involved in a fight with her boyfriend at Chateau Marmont.\n\nOn Friday, May 4, Lynne was seen arriving at LAX. Asked by a photographer if she would \"always be there no matter what\" for her daughter, the mother of three nodded in affirmation.\n\nLynne, who was busy talking on the phone in pictures obtained by Daily Mail, rocked a yellow top underneath a denim jacket. She paired the top with green pants and completed her look with nude-colored flip-flops. She added a wrist watch and a necklace as accessories.\n\nLynne was pushing her briefcase with another bag placed on top of it as she made her way out of the airport. She was then greeted by son Bryan and her granddaughter.\n\nBritney raised concerns among her fans after she and her boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz were involved in a disturbance at the Chateau Marmont on Wednesday night that triggered a call to the police. Paramedics arrived at the hotel around 12:40 A.M., where they encountered a visibly distressed Britney, draped in a blanket and clutching a pillow, walking out of the hotel.\n\nA few hours later, Britney spoke up on the incident with her social media page, denying that she had mental breakdown. \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!!\" she wrote. \"Not sure why I feel the need to share this ... I guess I'm just a girl and I'm on my period so I'm b***hy,\" she exasperated. \"Paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston !!! Peace.\"\n\nIn another post, the 42-year-old shares videos of her twisted ankle and blamed her mother for the incident, accusing Lynne of setting her up. \"I really twisted my ankle last night like an idiot. It's so bad,\" she narrated the video. \"I fell, embarrassed myself. That's it. Paramedics came at the door immediately...which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice. It is actually pretty bad, but s**t happens.\"\n\nIn the caption, Britney raised her suspicion about her mother's involvement in the incident. \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!!\" she wrote. \"I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nMeanwhile, another report claims that Britney and Paul had an \"intense fight\" at the Wynn resort before the Chateau Marmont incident. It was reportedly \"so bad\" that their suite was in ruins by the end of the altercation, which allegedly occurred during the last week of December 2023.\n\nBritney ended up \"paying the hotel tens of thousands of dollars\" to cover the damage, sources tell TMZ.

In a heartfelt Instagram Story post on Saturday, the 33-year-old actress and singer shared a photo of Lynne posing with granddaughters Maddie, 15, and Ivey, 5. The picture was from Maddie's recent high school prom. \"Happy birthday to my beautiful mama,\" Jamie captioned the family snapshot. The Zoey 101 star went on to praise her mom's youthful spirit and the joy she brings. \"She has a childlike spirit that brings magic to everything she does and we are so blessed to have her,\" Jamie wrote admiringly as per US Weekly. Her tribute comes amid ongoing family tensions with her older sister, pop icon Britney Spears.\n\nJust days prior, Britney had blamed their mother for allegedly being \"involved\" in a disturbing incident at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles. On Thursday, paramedics responded to the scene after reports of an injured woman, with photos showing Britney leaving the hotel barefoot while attempting to shield her face. While the 42-year-old claimed she had simply rolled her ankle, she lashed out at Lynne on Instagram. \"I know my mom was involved!!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news was out!!!\" Britney alleged. \"I was set up just like she did way back when!!! I wish I had grandparents!!! I can't stand her!!!\" However, Lynne appeared to deny any involvement when paparazzi asked at LAX if she'd \"always be there no matter what\" for Britney, nodding affirmatively.\n\nWhile Britney's struggles with her parents have played out publicly, Jamie seems intent on taking the high road. The latest drama is just one chapter in Britney's long-strained relationship with her family, particularly during her 13-year conservatorship controlled by her father Jamie Parnell Spears until its termination in 2021. In her recent memoir, Britney claimed Lynne had cruelly discarded her childhood belongings, though her mom disputed this. This particular incident made Britney realize she \"never wanted to see\" her family ever again. Despite the apparent rift with her sister, Jamie clearly cherishes her bond with their mother Lynne. Her affectionate birthday message highlights the \"magic\" Lynne brings as a doting grandmother to Maddie and Ivey.\n\nBritney's love life has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride lately. She right now is dating her on-again, off-again boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz. When things took a dramatic turn at the Chateau Marmont hotel in LA where she was present with her boyfriend Soliz, people assumed there was a blowout between them. The crazy incident went down just one night after Britney's divorce from her ex-husband Sam Asghari was finalized. Those close to Britney have been worried about her fling with Soliz from the start. Word first got out about them \"getting close\" last August, but insiders were skeptical given Soliz's shady past involving misdemeanor charges and a felony for threatening a child, as per Yahoo!", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lynn_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lynn Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoey_101", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoey 101"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-again,_off-again_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-again, off-again relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/691849/uploads/7bcb5da0-0b96-11ef-bf3d-0f750d44ab5a_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

I Did It Again\" songstress was reportedly screaming in the hallway and guests called the paramedics after they feared there was a possible \"injured person,\" a source at the hotel told the publication.\n\n\"Just to let people know ... the news is fake!!!\" the superstar wrote in a since-deleted post. \"Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\"\n\nBritney later reshared the statement and added, \"I also twisted my ankle and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston!! Peace.\"", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "whitney_danhauer@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Whitney Danhauer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Road_Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross Road Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxic (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oops!..._I_Did_It_Again_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oops!...

Cops couldn't confirm the claims once they got there, so no legal action was taken.\n\nBut after Britney and Paul moved their festivities to their room, things only escalated. The pair allegedly got into a loud fight -- with the Gimme More artist supposedly screaming in the hall at one point -- causing neighbors to dial 911. When help arrived early Thursday morning, Britney was later seen with the paramedics outside the hotel - but she notably did not leave in the ambulance.\n\nRelated: How Are Britney's Vacays Expensive?! Sources Dish On Her Nasty Habits...\n\nHours after the incident made headlines, the Grammy winner took to her Instagram to clap back at the reports, insisting the \"news is fake.\" Now, though? She's revealing she WAS injured and sharing how it happened!\n\nLate on Thursday, the Circus vocalist shared several videos of her swollen ankle on the 'gram, revealing she suffered a minor injury. She detailed:\n\n\"Ok, guys. So you know. I really twisted my ankle last night. It's so bad. F**king idiot here tries to do a leap in the living room of the [hotel], and I fell -- embarrassed myself -- and that's it.\"\n\nSlamming the first responders who came to her rescue, she added:\n\n\"Paramedics came to my door illegally. Of course, caused this huge scene, which was so unnecessary, and all I needed was ice. It is actually pretty bad, but s**t happens.\"\n\nIn a second video, the 42-year-old compared her ankles while crying! Aw!\n\nThings got super inneresting, though, in the caption when Britney took aim at her estranged mother Lynne Spears for allegedly being \"involved\" in the media storm, writing:\n\n\"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nOof. It's unclear if Britney was accusing the 68-year-old of calling the paramedics or leaking the news to the press. Either way, she was pissed!\n\nBut the post also included a picture of her lawyer Mathew Rosengart, whom she thanked for his ongoing support, concluding:\n\n\"Psss this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!\"\n\nWell, we're glad they're still on good terms even though they lost the conservatorship lawsuit! It's nice to know she has someone she can trust and rely on during times like these! See her latest update (below):\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by XILA MARIA RIVER RED (@britneyspears)\n\nSo, was this all just some big misunderstanding? It really depends on who you ask! While the Crossroads alum is insisting she was injured during an accident, sources told Page Six that the paramedics were called to the scene after she got into a huge fight her beau, one explained:\n\n\"Britney had a rough night and big fight, but she is incredibly resilient despite the trauma she endured during the conservatorship.\"\n\nBut if they're insinuating this injury was a result of the fight, that's definitely concerning!

In the clip, she can be seen moving her hips, walking back and forth, turning around, and spinning her head as she seems to sing along to Luis Fonsi's Latin hit.\n\nAt one point, Britney sticks her tongue out as she smiles at the camera and continues dancing. She wrote a cryptic caption alongside her Instagram post which reads: \"HOT PINK READS WELL... CONSIDERING PINKY IS MY REAL NAME !!! \"Pss... trying to keep things so professional and classy !!!

The superstar was placed under a conservatorship back in 2008. It gave her father Jamie Spears control over every aspect of her life - with the Princess of Pop facing restrictions on her spending, her visitors, and even the kind of phone she could have.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nThe conservatorship was terminated in 2021, after 13 years, and Britney is now largely free to make her own decisions about her life.

In the shocking pictures, the 42-year-old was seen wearing next to no clothing and covering herself up with a blanket and pillow.\n\nAfter the LA pictures emerged, sources told Page Six they feared for Britney and argued that she should have remained in a conservatorship. A source said: \"I hate to say it, but the way this is all going - this is what we feared.\"\n\nThe video was filmed in her living room She wore a pink bikini and black boots\n\nBut the singer insisted she had only twisted her ankle and claimed there was no cause for concern. The pop star posted two videos on her Instagram on Thursday night showing off her swollen ankle and blaming her mother for what happened. In the caption, Britney wrote: \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!!\" She continued: \"I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nWhile showing off her swollen ankle and foot, which also looked bruised, fans could hear Britney crying while explaining what happened. She told her Instagram followers that she \"really twisted her ankle last night like an idiot.\" She claimed that the injury came from trying to do a leap in the living room and she fell. To the singer it was \"so bad\" and she said she \"embarrassed\" herself. She also mentioned how the paramedics came and caused a huge scene, \"which was so unnecessary\" and all she needed was ice.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despacito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Despacito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Fonsi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Fonsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bikini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barefoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32737329.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Britney.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Also this week, a financial battle stemming from the conservatorship came to an end, when a judge ordered she pay $2 million for her dad's legal fees and denied her financial relief.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Once Upon a Time (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

The insider added that Britney ended up paying the hotel tens of thousands of dollars to cover the damage created during the incident.\n\nNot only did the couple reportedly trash a hotel room, but Paul allegedly damaged Britney's Mercedes when he was driving it.\n\nWhile not much is known about Britney and Paul's romance, one insider told the outlet that they are constantly fighting. \"Britney is out of control, and it's so bad I'm afraid of the worst,\" an additional source added, noting that she's not in a good place in regards to her mental health.\n\nThe report comes just one day after news surfaced that Britney and Paul had allegedly gotten into a heated argument in the late hours of Wednesday, May 1, when they were staying at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. Following the fight, paramedics were called to the scene because it was believed the \"Circus\" singer was having a mental breakdown. Britney was allegedly \"out of control, crying, possibly cut, and almost driven away in an ambulance,\" per TMZ.\n\nAfter the pair arrived at the hotel earlier that night, Britney allegedly caused a disturbance, and authorities were called. According to TMZ, guests claimed that a woman matching Britney's description had been harassing and threatening hotel guests and employees. However, officers left shortly after they arrived at the hotel because they saw no signs of trouble.\n\nBritney and Paul reportedly returned to their room around 11 p.m., though eventually got into a fight that turned physical. The mother of two was heard screaming in the hallway, and a source told the outlet that other guests called the cops in fear that she was \"injured.\" After the paramedics arrived at 12:40 a.m., Britney was photographed outside the hotel. She appeared to have been crying, while she and her security team reportedly left the property without Paul.\n\nJust hours after news of the altercation broke, Britney broke her silence on the matter in an Instagram post. \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake!!! Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!!\" she wrote, referencing photos of her leaving the hotel. \"I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\"\n\nHowever, a source exclusively told In Touch that Britney \"seemed completely out of it\" during the altercation. \"If she wasn't high on something she was definitely off her meds,\" the insider added.\n\nThe source went on to note that Paul \"tried to play it cool\" during the incident, \"but he was angry and definitely frustrated with her.

However, a few hours later Spears posted an emotional confessional video showcasing her injured ankle and blamed her mother Lynne Spears for the embarrassing moment. As per The UK Mirror, following the event, Jamie Lynn Spears, her sister, poked fun by sharing a cryptic post on Instagram stories: \"Me watching what I predicted unfold after everyone told me I was crazy.\" Britney recently responded to the meme with a quote: \"Don't ever lose sleep over people who ruined your dreams - Britney Spears,\" she posted on Instagram with a pink background.\n\nJamie Lynn also posted a heartfelt tribute to their mother on her birthday amid her elder sister's hotel drama. As per People, gushing over her mother's 'childlike spirit' she wrote: \"Happy Birthday to my beautiful mama. She has a childlike spirit that brings magic to everything she does, and we are so blessed to have her,\" the Sweet Magnolias actress added.

According to witnesses, after being examined by medics, Britney was not taken to the hospital. The following day, she posted a disturbing rant claiming the TMZ report was \"fake news\" orchestrated by her mom, Lynne Spears. \"I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger every day,\" Britney wrote, claiming the paramedics arrived unlawfully, and finished by informing fans, \"I felt completely harassed; I'm moving to Boston.\" It's becoming ever more apparent that if you weren't worried about Britney before, you should be now.", "source": {"uri": "nickiswift.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NickiSwift.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/if-you-werent-worried-about-britney-spears-before-you-should-be-now/l-intro-1714911144.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He was present at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles in the early hours of Thursday, May 2, when the fire department received a call about \"an adult female injured.\"\n\nSpears was later photographed walking out of the hotel barefoot, carrying a pillow and a blanket in her arms. A source later told Us Weekly that Spears \"rolled her ankle walking down the stairs.\"\n\nRegardless of what happened on Thursday night, a second source told Us that Spears' friends \"want Paul out of the picture.\"\n\n\"They have tried for months to tell her to stop associating with him but the more they tell her to stay away, it has the reverse effect,\" the source continued. \"She isn't listening to them.\"\n\nUs Weekly reached out to representatives for both Spears and Soliz for comment.\n\nSpears and Soliz's relationship is believed to have developed after Spears filed for divorce from Sam Asghari in August. In September, Soliz exclusively told Us Weekly that Spears is \"a phenomenal woman.\"\n\nBut those around Spears have seen \"a noticeable change\" in her since Soliz has been in the picture, said the second source.\n\nSpears' shift has been even more noticeable in the absence of Asghari, 30, according to the second source, saying Spears was \"doing pretty well\" when she was with her ex-husband. The couple's divorce was finalized on Thursday.\n\n\"Sam is a very structured person and would work out and eat well and it was hard for her to adapt to all of it, but she needed someone like him,\" the source added of the actor-model, who wed the singer in 2022. \"He provided good structure.\"\n\nSoliz, meanwhile, \"doesn't provide that structure and people around her have noticed he's bringing her down,\" the source says. \"There's some concern he is more of a yes man who gives into all of Britney's desires and whims and doesn't say no...[He's]not the best influence.\"\n\nPrior to his relationship with Spears, Soliz amassed a lengthy criminal record, including charges for multiple misdemeanors including disturbing the peace, child endangerment and driving without a license.\n\nIn December 2020, Soliz was arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon and unlawful possession of ammunition. Soliz ended up pleading no contest and was sentenced to two years probation and served 90 days in jail.\n\nThe second source explained that Spears \"does have a team around her,\" but given the end of her 13-year conservatorship in November 2021, \"she can say no if she doesn't want to do something.\"\n\nFinally, a third source added Spears is \"doing alright\" after the incident at the Chauteau Marmont, and \"recuperating at home tending to her ankle.\"\n\nFor the time being, the same source confirmed Spears and Soliz \"are still in touch and still seeing each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_trainor@usmagazine.com", "name": "Daniel Trainor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_the_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breach of the peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolo_contendere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolo contendere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Britney-Spears-Inner-Circle-Wary-of-Boyfriend-Paul-Richard-Soliz.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 583, "textEnd": 588}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 2547, "textEnd": 2560}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

It's thought the songstress got into a heated argument with her ex-boyfriend, Paul Richard Soliz.\n\nSeemingly knowing nothing about what went down, Sam took to his Instagram on Thursday, sharing a topless dog walk snap, captioning the upload \"life update\". News broke last night of Britney's troubles, with pictures emerging the evening of his post.\n\n\"You posted this right after Britney's post,\" commented one fuming follower.

In the second video, she showed her \"little foot\" but viewers could hear her cry when wanting to say something.\n\nSam and Britney started dating in 2016 after meeting on the set of her Slumber Party music video.

The insider added that Britney ended up paying the hotel tens of thousands of dollars to cover the damage created during the incident.\n\nNot only did the couple reportedly trash a hotel room, but Paul allegedly damaged Britney's Mercedes when he was driving it.\n\nWhile not much is known about Britney and Paul's romance, one insider told the outlet that they are constantly fighting. \"Britney is out of control, and it's so bad I'm afraid of the worst,\" an additional source added, noting that she's not in a good place in regards to her mental health.\n\nThe report comes just one day after news surfaced that Britney and Paul had allegedly gotten into a heated argument in the late hours of Wednesday, May 1, when they were staying at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. Following the fight, paramedics were called to the scene because it was believed the \"Circus\" singer was having a mental breakdown. Britney was allegedly \"out of control, crying, possibly cut, and almost driven away in an ambulance,\" per TMZ.\n\nAfter the pair arrived at the hotel earlier that night, Britney allegedly caused a disturbance, and authorities were called. According to TMZ, guests claimed that a woman matching Britney's description had been harassing and threatening hotel guests and employees. However, officers left shortly after they arrived at the hotel because they saw no signs of trouble.\n\nBritney and Paul reportedly returned to their room around 11 p.m., though eventually got into a fight that turned physical. The mother of two was heard screaming in the hallway, and a source told the outlet that other guests called the cops in fear that she was \"injured.\" After the paramedics arrived at 12:40 a.m., Britney was photographed outside the hotel. She appeared to have been crying, while she and her security team reportedly left the property without Paul.\n\nJust hours after news of the altercation broke, Britney broke her silence on the matter in an Instagram post. \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake!!! Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!!\" she wrote, referencing photos of her leaving the hotel. \"I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\"\n\nHowever, a source exclusively told In Touch that Britney \"seemed completely out of it\" during the altercation. \"If she wasn't high on something she was definitely off her meds,\" the insider added.\n\nThe source went on to note that Paul \"tried to play it cool\" during the incident, \"but he was angry and definitely frustrated with her.

With the beautiful service here in America I don't want to throw trash or spit in anyone's faces!!!\"\n\nThe star switched off the comments on this post. Her latest post comes after sources claimed her conservatorship should have continued due to fears about her mental health.\n\nThe chart-topping singer was placed under a conservatorship back in 2008. This gave her father Jamie Spears control over every aspect of her life, including restrictions on her spending, her visitors and even the kind of phone she could have.\n\nHer conservatorship finally came o an end in 2021 after 13 years, and Britney is now largely free to make her own decisions about her life. However some sources have shared their fears for the singer's mental health after reports that Britney was injured following an explosive fight with her boyfriend Paul Soliz.\n\nThe blonde bombshell recently injured her foot at the Chateau MArmont in the heart of Los Angeles, California, according to TMZ. In the shocking pictures, the singer was seen wearing almost no clothes, covering herself up with nothing but a blanket and a pillow.\n\nAfter the LA pictures hit the headlines, one insider told Page Six how they feared for Britney and argues that she should have remained in a conservatorship. A source said: \"I hate to say it, but the way this is all going - this is what we feared.\"\n\nBut the singer reassured fans that she had only twisted her ankle and claimed there was no reason to worry. The pop star posted two videos online on Thursday night (May 2) showing off her swollen ankle and blaming her mother for what happened.\n\nIn the caption wrote: \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!!\" She continued: \"I wish I had granparents !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nAs she showed off her swollen ankle and foot, which was green with bruising, fans could hear Britney crying while explaining what happened. She told viewers that she \"really twisted her ankle last night like an idiot\".\n\nThe star claimed she sustained the injury by trying to do a leap in the living room and she fell. Britney said it was \"so bad\" and she said she \"embarrassed\" herself. The star recalled how paramedics came to her suit and made a big scene \"which was so unnecessary\" when all she needed was ice.\n\nWant all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox?

Jamie Lynn Spears, the younger sibling of pop sensation Britney Spears, caught attention recently with a warm birthday message to their mother, Lynne Spears.\n\nThe heartfelt tribute on Instagram, featuring Lynne with her granddaughters Maddie, 15, and Ivey, 6, came at a tumultuous time for the Spears family, particularly for Britney, who is once again under the media microscope due to a distressing incident at Los Angeles's Chateau Marmont.\n\nThe \"Zoey 101\" actress's post seems to deflect from the recent waves of family drama, opting instead to celebrate her mother's 69th birthday. Jamie Lynn praised Lynne's \"childlike spirit\" and the magic she brings to their lives.\n\nThis gesture of familial affection starkly contrasts with the public spat between the Spears sisters, even more so against the backdrop of Britney's mental health crisis. Britney, having faced a challenging episode that led to an emergency response outside the infamous hotel, appears to be at another pivotal point in her long and often public struggle with mental health.\n\nBritney's situation was further complicated by the singer's claims against her mother, accusing Lynne of setting her up during her recent ordeal. Coupled with visuals of Britney, barely clothed and visibly distressed, these developments suggest a deepening rift within the Spears family.\n\nBeyond the family drama, Britney's incident raises significant concerns regarding her well-being, as she was seen arguing with her felon ex, Paul Richard Soliz, moments before her alarming appearance.\n\nDespite the family's internal tensions, Lynne seemingly attempted to bridge the gap by traveling to Los Angeles, presumably to be with Britney following her episode. This act of maternal concern comes after a period of estrangement, pointing to the complexities of family dynamics, especially under the relentless gaze of public attention.\n\nAs the Spears family navigates through these trying times, the unfolding drama reflects the broader challenges of managing personal crises in the public eye.\n\nJamie Lynn's birthday post to Lynne emerges not just as a gesture of goodwill but as a poignant reminder of the intricate ties that bind a family together, even when faced with adversity. Amidst the spectacle, the Spears women find themselves at a crossroads, seeking understanding and reconciliation in a world that watches their every move.", "source": {"uri": "aceshowbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AceShowbiz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aceshowbiz_team@aceshowbiz.com", "name": "AceShowbiz Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lynn_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lynn Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mom (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "69th Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoey_101", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoey 101"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridge (music)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2024/05/05/00223876.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

He's got a soft side, but we all know Britney likes bad boys. Sam was too nice for Britney, everyone knew it.\"\n\nAuthorities were called to the famous Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, California, on Wednesday, May 1, after guests at the hotel reportedly feared that Britney, 42, was having a mental breakdown. According to TMZ, the \"Toxic\" singer and Paul allegedly got into a fight at the hotel, and Britney was allegedly \"out of control, crying, possibly cut, and almost driven away in an ambulance.\"\n\nAfter Britney arrived at the Chateau Marmont, she allegedly created a disturbance that led to the authorities being called. Hotel guests claimed that someone who matched Britney's description was \"harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests.\" However, after authorities arrived at around 10:30 p.m., they reportedly left after seeing no cause for concern. Britney and Paul allegedly returned to their room at approximately 11:00 p.m. only to later get into a physical altercation. Paramedics arrived back at the location after guests reportedly feared an \"injured person,\" according to the publication.\n\nThe \"Baby One More Time\" artist was seen outside the establishment, wrapped in a blanket and holding a pillow, while walking with paramedics after midnight. She then reportedly left the Chateau Marmont with her security team but without Paul.\n\n\"Just to let people know ... the news is fake!!!\" the \"Womanizer\" artist posted and quickly deleted alongside a photo of a male model, according to screenshots captured and shared by fans on X. \"Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\"\n\nThe Grammy winner later reshared the statement on Instagram and added, \"I also twisted my ankle and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston!! Peace.\"\n\nPaul and Britney were first rumored to be romantically involved shortly after she and Sam separated in August 2023. The couple met when Paul was hired in a housekeeper-type role at Britney's home in Calabasas. However, he was allegedly let go after Britney's team discovered his criminal background.

They were married for just a year.\n\nThe photographs raised uncomfortable memories of Spears' previous \"meltdowns\" in front of the cameras in 2007 and 2008.\n\nOne source told us they worry she has turned to some kind of substance abuse, adding, \"I hate to say it, but the way this is all going -- this is what we feared.\"\n\nSpears was seen walking out of the legendary hotel barefoot, carrying a pillow and covered in a blanket.\n\nWe reported she had fought with her boyfriend, Paul Richard Soliz, which resulted in paramedics being called.\n\nSoliz, who has been working on maintenance around Britney's LA home since 2022, has a lengthy criminal background, with charges for multiple misdemeanors including disturbing the peace, child endangerment and driving without a license.\n\nIn December 2020 he was arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon and unlawful possession of ammunition.\n\nSoliz ended up pleading no contest and was sentenced to two years probation and served 90 days in jail.\n\nBritney's 13-year conservatorship that guarded her finances and health was ended in November 2021 after public outrage at her treatment, particularly by her father.\n\nLate last month Britney's legal argument Jamie had fleeced her out of millions was settled, with the star paying her dad's estimated $2 million legal fees.\n\nBut an insider highly familiar with the court case and the internet campaign to \"Free Britney\" told Page Six, \"The narrative of Britney having been locked away for no good reason other than her dad being evil and wanting to work her for every last penny has always been wrong.\n\n\"There is no question that Jamie Spears is a flawed father and the way that Britney was put to work in Vegas was awful. It should never have happened.\n\n\"However, there is also no question that the conservatorship -- and the interventions prior to it -- happened for a reason and it wasn't because her dad wanted to make some nefarious money grab.\n\n\"It was put in place because Britney has serious mental health issues and was going completely off the rails.\"\n\nBefore the latest incident, a source who knows Jamie told us, \"I have never believed that Jamie is the villain in this situation.\n\n\"I think he has been unfairly vilified by people who know nothing about the situation and have nothing to do with it. I hate to say it, but he could be vindicated.\"\n\nThe source pointed out that Judge Brenda Penny, Los Angeles County Superior Court never put Britney through an evaluation when she ended the conservatorship.\n\nAt the time, Judge Penny said there was \"no need for a capacity declaration\" of Spears, noting that it had been a voluntary conservatorship.\n\nA former boyfriend of the singer, who dated her for several years while she was under the conservatorship, told Page Six, \"I think she needs to get off all meds, avoid drugs and alcohol and pick up the Bible.\n\n\"She always said, too, that she wanted to go home to Louisiana. I hope she does. I'm not sure why she's still in LA. It's a cesspool there.\"\n\nHe also dubbed Britney's manager and BFF, Cade Hudson, an \"opportunist\" and said Britney needs more \"real people\" around her.\n\nOne insider familiar with the conservatorship case said, \"So many many many guardrails were put into place -- some could say a few too many, and perhaps for a little too long -- but now that every last one of them has been removed?\n\n\"The world is getting to see what Britney is like when left to her own devices and it's not good.\"\n\nBritney bizarrely even blamed her estranged mom Lynne Spears for Thursday's night incident.\n\nThe inside familiar with the conservatorship told us, as the insider said, \"It will be even harder now to get Britney under any kind of control.\n\n\"Her family can't go near her... I worry that everyone else who comes into her orbit only wants her money.\n\n\"It's an absolute tragedy and there is just absolutely no way for it to end well.\"\n\nHowever Sam Lufti, Britney's mysterious former manager told us, \"I managed Britney and lived with her and I never witnessed anything other than an amazing woman, a super talented artist and an incredibly hospitable roommate.\n\n\"If you had cameras on you 24/7 I can assure you that you'd have countless micro moments of embarrassing yet innocuous footage.\n\n\"Britney has dedicated her entire life to entertaining the world only to be stabbed in the back by her family, the media and the judicial system, all based on nonsensical press coverage.\n\n\"Britney hasn't harmed anyone, she's an independent woman, She deserves more respect and privacy in fact she's entitled to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears_conservatorship_dispute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears conservatorship dispute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolo_contendere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nolo contendere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/britney-spears-conservatorship-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1714746851&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 1454, "textEnd": 1467}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Regardless, she insists she did not suffer a \"breakdown\" as some reports have been alleging.\n\nOn Monday, Britney sent her fans another message on Instagram in the caption of a video that features her riding a horse.\n\n\"I honestly wish my life was as wild as it has been portrayed !! Either way, some s--- actually has happened to my foot and I might have to get surgery ... fingers crossed hopefully not but I feel that I was harassed and gaslit and tricked to go on the street when my car was supposed to be there !!\" Britney explained.\n\n\"I was in my pajamas and yes, I had been crying because hurt my foot !! No breakdown !!! I'm a grown a-- woman who is actually very naive in most situations !!!\" she continued. \"I am simply embarrassed they got me in my d--- pajamas !!!\"\n\n\"I don't feel loved ... I feel mistreated !!! With that said, I'm going to treat myself this week !!!\" she concluded\n\nOn Friday night, Britney Spears gave fans a look at her swollen foot on the second slide of an Instagram carousel. In the length caption, she explained that she had been \"reading a lot of spiritual books lately.\"\n\nShe went into detail on one book, which was apparently about parallel universes and the ability to cross between them. However, she did not share the title or the author of the book.\n\nShe wrapped up her lengthy caption by writing, \"OK, some may think this is BS... lol Britney S....sorry had to !!! But that's my name don't wear it out !!! but honestly staying in is way cooler don't y'all think ??? Swipe if you wanna see a beautiful foot !!!\"\n\nAlthough Britney and her mother, Lynne Spears, seemed to be on good terms for her 42nd birthday party last December, it seems that their relationship has eroded to the point that the Princess of Pop believes that her mother had something to do with the incident at the Chateau Marmont.\n\nOn Thursday night, Britney shared another look at her swollen foot. In the video, she can be heard saying, \"Okay guys, so you know, I really twisted my ankle last night, like an idiot.\n\n\"It's so bad. F---ing idiot here tries to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau and I fell and embarrassed myself. And, uh, that's it,\" she continued. \"Paramedics came to my door illegally, of course, cause this huge scene, which was so unnecessary when all I needed was ice.\" At the end of the video, she added, \"It is actually pretty bad, but s--- happens.\"\n\nIn the caption, she wrote, \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nShe then seemingly addressed her lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, adding, \"Psss this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!\"\n\nEarlier that same night, Britney shared another Instagram post, writing, \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday !!!\"\n\n\"Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie ??? Goddesses out there, I'm reaching my higher power and furthermore, I hope you guys are too !!!

His black shirt appeared to be hanging out of his pants.\n\n\"Life update,\" he captioned the post with a smiling emoji.\n\nMany of Sam's fans found the timing of his post to be interesting, as it came on the same day that news broke of Britney's alleged public fight with Paul, 37. Late in the evening on Wednesday, May 1, the \"Toxic\" singer and her boyfriend arrived at Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, TMZ reported. Guests claimed that Britney was \"harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests,\" which led to the authorities being called, according to the outlet. However, when officers arrived on the scene at 10:30 p.m., they saw no signs of trouble and left.\n\nBritney and Paul \"retreated\" back to their room around 11 p.m. and continued partying, but they allegedly got into an altercation that became physical, according to TMZ. The Crossroads star was reportedly screaming in the hallway, which prompted fellow guests to call an ambulance because they feared someone was \"injured,\" a source told the outlet.\n\nBritney was believed to be having a mental breakdown after her and Paul's alleged fight. She was \"out of control, crying, possibly cut, and almost driven away in an ambulance,\" TMZ reported. Paramedics made contact with her at 12:40 a.m. She was then seen outside the hotel with a blanket wrapped around her arms and clutching a pillow. Britney had seemingly been crying. The singer reportedly left with her security team, but without Paul.\n\nBritney addressed the reports in an Instagram post on May 2, writing, \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake!!! Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\"\n\nShe later added, \"I also twisted my ankle and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston!! Peace.\"\n\nThe singer also claimed that her mother, Lynne Spears, was \"involved\" in the situation. \"I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out,\" she wrote. \"I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it.\"\n\nPaul was hired as a housekeeper in Britney's home in 2022, but he was allegedly later let go because of his criminal history, which includes disturbing the peace, child endangerment and firearm possession.\n\nPaul and Britney were first romantically linked after her split from Sam, whom she was married to from June 2022 to August 2023. However, the initial romance with Paul was short-lived. Britney has not confirmed that she rekindled her relationship with her former housekeeper, but the two have been spotted out together multiple times recently, including on a drive around the San Fernando Valley on April 25.\n\nBritney's new boyfriend has sparked concern from Sam, a source exclusively told In Touch on May 2.\n\n\"Britney's new guy raised red flags for everyone, but Britney. Sam especially, he saw how Britney interacted with Paul, openly flirting with him,\" the insider said. \"Paul may look tough and be rough around the edges, but he's a sweet talker. He's got a soft side, but we all know Britney likes bad boys. Sam was too nice for Britney, everyone knew it.\"", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elise_nelson@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Elise Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatpants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweatpants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxic (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Touch_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "In Touch Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_the_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breach of the peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Fernando Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Britney-Spears-Ex-Sam-Asghari-Shares-Life-Update.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C2800px%2C1472px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 62, "textEnd": 67, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 590, "textEnd": 595}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 3203, "textEnd": 3211}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The post coincided with the breaking news of Britney's alleged mental health troubles, reports the Mirror.\n\nFans were fuming, with one writing on the post: \"You posted this right after Britney's post. Another chimed in: \"Timing is everything. There is no way this coincidence. @samasghari you are too classy for this. Just don't (do it).\"\n\nA third lamented: \"Very sad.

Late Wednesday night, the 42-year-old pop icon emerged from the Chateau Marmont, following the dispatch of an ambulance to the Sunset Strip location. Uncertainty surrounds the ambulance's call for Spears, who was present with her ex-housekeeper, Paul Richard Soliz.\n\nSpears exited the building barefoot and in white shorts, clutching a pillow and wrapping in a brown blanket as she bypassed the ambulance with the others. An onlooker said that she did not get into the stretcher that was brought out for her.\n\nAs for the ambulance, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson confirmed it received a 911 call for an injured adult female at 12:42 a.m. today but had no further details. The ambulance arrived, but it departed from the hotel at 1:17 a.m. without transporting anyone to the hospital, leading to no law enforcement action.\n\nWhile Spears hasn't responded to requests for comment, sources indicate she is safe at home.

She also detailed the twisting of her ankle, which she attributed to her mother, Lynne Spears.

Cops were unable to confirm those claims once they arrived at the scene, so they left without taking legal action.\n\nHowever, things escalated once Britney and Paul continued to party in their room. They allegedly got into a loud altercation, and Britney began to scream in the hallway at one point -- causing hotel guests and employees to call 911 again. Paramedics came to the hotel early Thursday morning to help an unidentified \"injured\" female. Britney was spotted with the EMTS outside the hotel. However, she did not leave in the ambulance.\n\nRelated: Sam Asghari Ripped For Posting Thirst Trap Amid Hotel Drama!\n\nBritney later gave fans a look at her hurt foot, saying she hurt it \"trying to do a leap\" in the living room of the hotel. Now we have more details about what actually caused the injury. A source claimed to Dailymail.com on Friday that Britney and Paul were heavily drinking at the hotel bar and eventually got cut off. When the couple were refused further service, they went back to their room. The insider said:\n\n\"They stormed off and were being really loud and causing a ruckus. One thing was certain - they certainly didn't need any more alcohol.\"\n\nRoughly 30 minutes after leaving the bar, complaints started coming in from other guests about the noise Paul and Britney were making while \"arguing\" in the hallway outside their room. The pop star was also \"doing cartwheels\" and suddenly injured her foot. The source claimed:\n\n\"Britney and her friend were in the hallway outside their room being loud and arguing. Britney was also doing cartwheels up and down the hallway and then started screaming that she had hurt herself.\"\n\nYikes! And she appears to have hurt her foot badly! Less than 48 hours after the incident, Britney shared a new close-up video of her swollen ankle and foot on Friday. And it doesn't look good! She even compared her \"real foot\" to her injured one, showing how it's double in size with bruises around the ankle, heel, and toes! She said in the clip:\n\n\"I guess it's a little bit bigger today. It's really swollen. My foot is so big right now. ... Oh my God!\"\n\nOh no! Hopefully, Brit Brit got this checked out just in case! Swipe (below) to the second slide to take a look at the video:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by XILA MARIA RIVER RED (@britneyspears)\n\nOuch!\n\nAnd see pictures of the injury (below):\n\nWell, Britney most likely won't be doing any dancing, leaping, or cartwheeling for the next couple of weeks! Not with that injured foot! Oof. We hope she's doing OK following the incident. Reactions, Perezcious readers?

He neglects his children for her.\"\n\nThe \"Toxic\" singer, 42, initially hired Soliz, 37, in 2022 for a housekeeper-type position at her house, but the business relationship eventually turned romantic, sources confirmed to Page Six, despite the fact that he was fired in 2023 after his criminal record was exposed.\n\nMancilla, 36, said Soliz stays at Spears' multimillion-dollar Thousand Oaks, Calif., mansion but lists a bungalow a few blocks away as his legal residence.\n\n\"He's on probation, so if he officially lives at her house, they have access to searching her house,\" she explained, \"so that's why he still has an address here.\"\n\nMancilla and her five kids live with her mother, Sandra Smith.\n\n\"He has 10 kids. He doesn't support any of them,\" Smith, a surgical assistant, claimed to the Daily Mail. \"They have a 1-year-old together, and he doesn't even pay attention to that one either.\"\n\nSmith, 60, called Soliz a \"deadbeat dad\" and said he has put her in a \"difficult\" position because he allegedly \"doesn't support one kid, and they're at my house.\"\n\n\"Nicole's torn up by everything. This has been going on for five years. And he doesn't leave her alone; he keeps coming back,\" she added. \"I wouldn't let him see the kids if it was me. She does because she wants them to have a dad. But I wouldn't want a dad like that.\"\n\nCourt documents filed by the Los Angeles County Support Services on March 22, 2024, and obtained by Page Six demand Soliz pay $1,167 per month in child support starting May 1, 2024, plus 50 percent of health care costs for his children Trystan, 9, Dylan, 8, and Violet, 1.\n\nThe documents also state that Soliz earns $2,773 per month, while Mancilla has no income.\n\nA separate court case filed in 2021 determined Soliz to be the father of Trystan and Dylan, as well as Cesar, 17, and Nicholas, 6.\n\nSpears' relationship with the handyman is being scrutinized once again in light of their altercation at the Chateau Marmont last week that resulted in an ambulance being called to the scene.\n\nPhotos showed the distraught-looking \"Crossroads\" star covering herself with a pillow and a blanket as first responders surrounded the couple outside the famed hotel in West Hollywood, Calif.\n\nA source told us that Spears ultimately left with security, adding that she was \"home\" and \"safe.\"\n\nThe \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" songstress later claimed on social media that paramedics had come to her hotel room \"illegally\" and said news of the fight was \"fake.\" She also claimed she had injured herself and proceeded to share images of a swollen and bruised foot while blaming her mother, Lynne Spears, for the hotel drama without further explanation.\n\nFollowing the whirlwind week of drama, multiple sources told Page Six that Britney should have been kept under her conservatorship, which a Los Angeles judge terminated in November 2021, amid fears that she has turned to illicit substances.\n\n\"I hate to say it, but the way this is all going -- this is what we feared,\" one source shared.\n\nA second insider acknowledged Britney's father and former conservator, Jamie Spears, was \"flawed\" but had put the guardianship into place in February 2008 \"for a reason, and it wasn't because her dad wanted to make some nefarious money grab.\"\n\n\"It was put in place because Britney has serious mental health issues and was going completely off the rails,\" the insider added.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com",

TMZ broke the story ... Britney got into a fight with current boyfriend Paul Soliz -- with paramedics showing up to tend to her.\n\nIn the video she posted, Britney tried to downplay the incident ... claiming first responders showed up \"illegally\" to treat her. As we reported, she refused treatment, but this video makes it clear she's got a pretty gnarly injury.\n\nShe says she just landed the wrong way while doing a leap in the living room at the Chateau.\n\nShe's clearly upset someone called paramedics to the scene, and she's blaming one person in particular -- her mom, Lynne Spears.\n\nBritney's under the impression Lynne was not only the one who called paramedics, but possibly the paparazzi ... as one photo agency got the shots of Britney exiting the Chateau draped in a blanket and pillow.\n\nShe added, \"I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out!!! I was set up just like she did way back when!!! I wish I had grandparents!!! I can't stand her!!!

At the time, Britney kept her Australian Shepherd, Sawyer, her Yorkie, Hannah, and 2 other smaller dogs.\n\nSam's thirst trap upload has many of Brit's fans criticizing his timing ... calling it insensitive to her plight and injury.\n\nStill, his message is pretty clear -- he's doing just fine post-divorce.

The singer reaching a divorce settlement with estranged spouse Sam Asghari has only piqued fans' interest in Britney Spears' allegedly dwindling fortune. Here's what we know about her net worth as the former couple amicably settled their divorce nine months after separating from 14 months of marriage.\n\nAs per PEOPLE, the former couple upheld the terms of their prenuptial agreement and parted amicably despite claims Britney Spears was paying Asghari's rent. This claim has since been refuted by a source who told the outlet, \"She is not on any lease for him.\" The source also added that recent reports that Britney Spears was draining all her money were false, saying, \"The report that she is in financial distress is false.\"\n\nThe denial comes amid Pagesix reporting the hitmaker was blowing through her Multi-Million Dollar estate less than three years after the court terminated her conservatorship in November 2021. However, the latest reports from a source close to Britney Spears refuting the allegations suggest the pop singer's fortune is very much intact. Here's how much she's worth today.\n\nAccording to reports, Britney Spears's net worth in 2024 is between $60 million and $70 million. The figures were extrapolated from a Forbes report, which estimated her 2024 net worth at $60 Million and Celebrity Net Worth, which alleged Britney Spears' net worth is even higher at $70 Million.\n\nBritney became a household name in 1998 when she debuted her first single, \"...Baby One More Time,\" at 16. She went on to create memorable hits like \"Toxic\" and \"Oops!... I Did It Again.\"\n\nEverything changed for the Grammy award-winning singer in 2007 after she was admitted into a drug rehabilitation center amid troubling behavior, which included shaving her head with electric clippers. Amid the escalating erratic behavior, Britney Spears' conservatorship was created in February 2008 to protect her estate and children's financial future.\n\nWhile still under conservatorship, her net worth in 2018 was estimated at $59,079,755.76, according to court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight. Spears's net worth at the time was estimated to be less than some of her pop music peers, including Rihanna, who was reportedly worth $600 million. Rihanna has since become a billionaire.\n\nHere's how Britney Spears made her fortune\n\nForbes reported that Britney earned $30 million in 2018 from music sales, her Las Vegas residency, \"Britney: Piece of Me.\" She also had a successful perfume line, including Fantasy and Curious, which reportedly earned $30 Million in 2013 sales alone. She was also paid $15 million for her role as a judge on FOX's The X Factor in 2012.\n\nForbes revealed in 2017 that the troubled singer grossed over $103 million across less than 250 shows. In 2022, Page Six, citing anonymous sources, reported that her deal with Simon & Schuster for her memoir was valued at $15 million. TMZ alleged that Spears was getting 25% of the net profits from the memoir.\n\nDespite substantial earnings, her net worth has remained comparably low.", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Koimoi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anushree_madappa@koimoi.com", "name": "Anushree Madappa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimme_More", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gimme More"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prenuptial agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Baby_One_More_Time_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "...Baby One More Time (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxic (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The X Factor (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oops!..._I_Did_It_Again_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oops!...

Either way, some sh- actually has happened to my foot and I might have to get surgery ... fingers crossed, hopefully not.\"\n\nThe post comes a few days after Spears shared videos of her bruised, swollen foot on the platform shortly after hurting herself at the Los Angeles hotel. As she explained at the time, the \"Toxic\" singer had attempted a risky leap in the Marmont's living room in the early morning of May 2, resulting in what she then believed was a twisted ankle.\n\nThe incident was reported to the local fire department at around 12:42 that morning, and an ambulance was dispatched to the hotel. Photos from the scene captured the musician exiting the building barefoot alongside rumored boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz, after which the LAFD confirmed to Billboard that paramedics had departed around 1:17 a.m. without any indication of whether they ever encountered or treated Spears.\n\nTouching on her appearance in the photos from the night, Spears wrote in her new post, \"I was in my pajamas and yes, I had been crying because I hurt my foot !!!

Fans are talking about her divorce settlement, conservatorship drama, and pre-weekend medical incident, and now there's more. On Saturday, the 42-year-old singer posted to Instagram in dance mode, with a caption giving a nod to both her choice of pink swimwear and, it would seem, her \"real name.\"\n\nPosting as she recovers from a twisted ankle sustained after a reported fight with her boyfriend at the swanky Chateau Marmont, Britney shared what may have been throwback footage of herself dancing around in a bathing suit and heeled boots. The Grammy-winning hitmaker, who goes by \"XILA\" on her IG handle, is apparently named after something very pink.\n\nLikely home and nursing her twisted ankle, Britney looked vibrant as she popped with a golden tan contrasting her bright pink bikini.\n\n\"HOT PINK READS WELL... CONSIDERING PINKY IS MY REAL NAME !!!\" she wrote.\n\n\"Pss... trying to keep things so professional and classy !!! With the beautiful service here in America I don't want to throw trash or spit in anyone's faces !!!\" the ex to Sam Asghari continued. Britney's full legal name is Britney Jean Spears. Given that her post was fairly lighthearted in nature, it can be assumed that her \"name\" reveal was in jest. The singer has, however, massively worried her fans of late as her Instagram posts often appear bizarre and, recently, come complete with angry outbursts toward her family.\n\nBritney is further in the news for recently having settled her divorce from personal trainer and actor Sam Asghari. The former couple, who met in 2016, were married for only 14 months. Sam filed for divorce, citing: \"irreconcilable differences,\" however he is said to be feeling sorry for Britney after her ankle trauma. Sources say the hunky star found the situation \"worrisome.\"\n\n\"Sam has been down this road with Britney before and knows how she is,\" an insider continued.\n\nBritney suffers from bipolar disorder. She has often maintained that she is well amid sporadic posting sprees on social media. The star has also told her fans to stop bullying her with their comments, possibly explaining why comments to the feed are currently disabled.\n\nA recent post from the blonde read: \"Goddesses out there, I'm reaching my higher power, and furthermore, I hope you guys are too!!!

But I wouldn't want a dad like that.'\n\nMancilla, who lives in a three-bed townhouse in Sylmar, claimed Soliz cheated on her with Britney Spears and now 'neglects' his kids for the pop star\n\nMancilla's mother, 60-year-old surgical assistant Sandra Smith (pictured) told DailyMail.com Soliz is the father of at least nine children, none of whom he supports financially, she claims\n\nCourt records obtained by DailyMail.com show a civil case against Soliz brought by DCSS on March 22, with a demand for Soliz to pay $1,167 monthly child support plus 50% of healthcare costs for Trystan Alexzander Soliz, 9; Dylan Andrew Soliz, 8, and baby Violet Pearl Soliz, 21 months.\n\nThe complaint says that the children have been receiving public benefits since January 2020.\n\nIt lists Soliz's income as $2,774 per month, and Mancilla's as zero.\n\nIn September 2021 an LA judge determined Soliz was the father of Trystan and Dylan, as well as Cesar Martinez-Mancilla, 17, and Nicholas Soliz, 6.\n\nBaby Violet's parentage has not been officially determined by the courts.\n\nLA County also filed a complaint against Soliz in 2019 for $615 monthly child support he allegedly owed to Alexandra Gonzalez for their twins, Anevy and Avery Soliz, 5.\n\nA judgment in January 2022 confirmed he was the father, but said his child support obligation was 'zero'.\n\nSpears sparked mental health crisis concerns after being pictured barefoot and topless outside the Chateau Marmont in the early hours of Thursday, May 2, following an alleged fight with Soliz.\n\nThe singer, 42, had abrasions on her knees and looked disheveled as she stepped out flanked by her security and her and felon 'boyfriend'.\n\nIt has been claimed that Britney and Paul got into a row before a woman matching Britney's description was 'harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests.'\n\nShortly after the Thursday morning incident, Britney shockingly shared a video of herself dancing in a sparkly costume and heeled boots at her Thousand Oaks home\n\nWhile Britney insisted in February that she was single, she has been linked to Paul in recent months following her split from husband Sam Asghari.\n\nSoliz and Britney have known each other since he was hired to complete housekeeping tasks and maintenance around her house about a year ago, according to US weekly.\n\nSpeaking to the publication he revealed he fixed bits and bobs around the house including fixing doorknobs and unclogging toilets.\n\nInsiders told Page Six that Paul was fired from his job working for Britney, but she had 'still chosen to spend time with' him 'and is not trying to hide their new-found friendship.'\n\nIn August Britney was seen driving a white Mercedes-Benz with a mystery man who is thought to be Paul in her passenger seat in Calabasas, California.\n\nThat same month, her husband Sam is said to have filed for divorce, citing 'irreconcilable differences', which led to Britney enjoying a dalliance with her former housekeeper.\n\nBritney Spears will not have to pay spousal support to her third husband Sam Asghari under the terms of their divorce settlement, it has been confirmed\n\nAn insider told DailyMail.com in September that the pair weren't officially dating, clarifying: 'They had a short fling after Sam left but that was it.\n\n'Britney hooked up with him twice and, at the time, [she] did not know about his criminal past. She no longer has any communication with him.'\n\nSoliz was convicted in connection with disturbing the peace in April 2014. His plea deal led to a child endangerment charge against him being dismissed.\n\nHe was convicted of driving without a license in 2016, Us Weekly reported, citing court documents. A charge of driving with a suspended license was dismissed that year after a plea agreement, according to Page Six.\n\nIn December 2020 Soliz was convicted for felony firearm possession, during the time he was working for Spears.\n\nThen, in September 2023 he was seen at the San Fernando Superior Court after allegedly violating his probation.\n\nDespite his past, Paul insisted that he isn't a 'bad dude' in an interview with Backgrid last September.\n\nHe confessed he has a 'handful of children' and that one of the mothers has passed away.\n\n'I have custody of my children, I'm not a bad dude. I own my own business. I do licensed contractor technique tile,' he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The pop star twisted her ankle in what she described as a 'stupid act' in an explanatory Instagram video. Spears and her intermittent lover Paul Soliz were rumored to have gotten into a physical altercation, according to the initial reports from the media sites.\n\nThose close to the star reportedly want her ex-convict boyfriend to be gone for good. An insider revealed to The US Sun, that Soliz was a 'bad influence'. \"We know that a few weirdos from her past have been trying to get back into her life,\" the insider said. \"But all we can do as her friends is give her legal reps the heads up if we think any of them could cause problems for her.\" The source added, \"But yes, none of us like Paul.\"\n\n\"None of us want her to go to Boston and this is the first time we'd heard of it, but she doesn't feel safe in LA,\" the source said after Spears mentioned on Instagram that she wished to shift to Boston. \"Do any of us trust this Paul guy? No. But she knows she can't trust her parents either...It's easy for predators to target her because they know she doesn't have the protection of her family. We are concerned about her...She needs support and someone who has their eye on her heart and not her hard-earned cash.\" Elaborating on some of the concerns, the insider asserted, \"To some of us, it feels like he came out of nowhere and we don't trust that he isn't just a grifter. Once again, if her parents were stand-up people she could turn to them for guidance but she knows they aren't so she can't.\"\n\nThe source later added that Spears \"believes that she is the target of a smear campaign.\" They said, \"She finds it comical that some are concerned that she can't manage her own life, but were very confident that she could manage the stress of live performances and TV appearances when they're making money from her.\" As per Marca, it is reported that the Circus songstress got into an ugly fight with her partner Soliz earlier in Las Vegas. The couple trashed the hotel room during their intense argument which upset fellow hotel guests.\n\nThe sources further stated that the events in Vegas took place at the Wynn Resort in the final week of December. TMZ reports that the argument was 'so bad' that their suite was destroyed by the end. Spears reportedly had to pay the hotel 'tens of thousands of dollars' to repair the damages. However, her troubles did not end there.

Sources told the outlet Britney and Paul got into a massive fight while staying at the Wynn Las Vegas the last week of December. Their spat got so heated they allegedly trashed their hotel room by the end of it! Jeez!\n\nRelated: Sam Asghari Ripped For Posting Thirst Trap Amid Britney Spears Hotel Drama!\n\nObviously no paramedics, no paps that time. So no story. Plue, per sources, the Circus artist also kept things quiet by shelling out tens of thousands of dollars to cover the damage. TENS OF THOUSANDS?! That's how nasty things apparently got!\n\nWhat the heck were they even arguing about?! Whatever the dispute, it was bad enough to cause them to wreck the place! And the pair didn't just ruin the hotel room that week. Additionally, insiders claimed Paul damaged Britney's Mercedes during the same trip! We don't want to think about how much she spent to repair the vehicle! Given her alleged financial troubles, fingers crossed not too much!\n\nAnd these two hotel fights aren't just rare incidents in their relationship. The sources further shared with the outlet that Britney and Paul are constantly at each other's throats! One insider claimed:\n\n\"Britney is out of control, and it's so bad I'm afraid of the worst.\"\n\nThe worst? Meaning what?!\n\nMeanwhile, two sources alleged her mental health struggles are on the same level as they were pre-conservatorship and getting worse. Hmm. And at this point, Paul reportedly is her go-to for everything. He even orders around her security. Whoa! As we previously reported, the singer's friends are \"concerned\" about her well-being after their most recent incident. If Britney and Paul fight constantly and it's reached the point where their arguments are damaging property and/or causing a disruption, can you blame them for worrying? It doesn't sound like a healthy relationship at all. An insider for Page Six said:\n\n\"[Soliz is] a bad influence on her just as she is moving on with her life, flexing her freedom and moving on from Sam.\"\n\nBig yikes...\n\nFortunately, Britney returned home \"safe\" -- and without Paul -- following their alleged confrontation at the LA hotel this week. Whether or not they remain apart from here on out? Time will tell. But her loved ones and fans better hope these two keep their distance from each other from now on if their history of conflict is real. Thoughts, Perezcious readers?

The family was catapulted into the spotlight when firstborn Britney became a pop star in the early aughts. After going through a series of personal struggles in 2008, Britney was placed under a 13-year conservatorship that was run by Jamie, 71. The guardianship was terminated in November 2021.\n\nEarlier this week, Britney sparked concern from fans after she was spotted being escorted out of Los Angeles' Chateau Marmont barefoot. A spokesperson for the LAFD later revealed that they responded to a call about a woman who was injured.\n\nBritney spoke out about the incident on Thursday, May 2, claiming via Instagram that she had rolled her ankle and blamed Lynne for the situation.\n\n\"I know my mom was involved!!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out!!!\" the Grammy winner alleged in her social media upload. \"I was set up just like she did way back when!!! I wish I had grandparents!!! I can't stand her!!! I honestly don't care, I will say it.\"\n\nLynne has since denied the accusations. While walking through the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, May 3, Lynne was asked by Daily Mail photographers if she'll \"always be there no matter what\" for her eldest daughter. Lynne nodded in response, seemingly indicating that she would always have Britney's back.\n\nBritney has long had her issues with her mom. In her 2023 Women in Me memoir, Britney even claimed that Lynne had tossed her beloved Madame Alexander dolls and childhood poetry.

She also blasted paramedics for coming to her room \"illegally\" and called the whole thing a \"set up\" orchestrated by her estranged momma! She wrote on Instagram late last week:\n\n\"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nThe accusation was pretty brutal considering the mother and daughter had seemingly just reconciled. But even despite Britney's claims, not all hope is lost! Why? Because within 24 hours of the incident, Lynne jetted to El Lay!\n\nThat's right, the pop star's mom was seen arriving at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday where she was greeted by her son Bryan Spears, who has maintained a close bond with his sis despite the big family feud, and a granddaughter.\n\nIn a video obtained by DailyMail.com, Lynne had very little to say on the controversy surrounding the Crossroads alum, but she made it clear she's still got Britney's back. When asked if she's \"always going to be there for [her] daughter ... no matter what,\" Lynne nodded her head in agreement. Look HERE.\n\nIt's unclear if Lynne is in the area to see the embattled singer or just visiting Bryan's family. Her subtle response and the timing of her arrival to the city are a good sign, though. From the sounds of it, Britney could use all the support she can get right now -- and even if things are a little rocky with Lynne at the moment, maybe a visit would do her good? They could at least clear the air! But only time will tell...\n\nThoughts?!

According to The Daily Mail, Spears walked out of the hotel with Soliz, with her security guard trailing closely behind. The popstar was observed with bruises on her knees and a lady who fit her description was allegedly weeping and yelling in the hotel hallway, according to those who briefed the authorities.\n\nAfter the incident, a source revealed to The Sun that her friends are not thrilled that she is back with Soliz and are afraid that malicious people from her past are trying to manipulate her. The insider spilled, \"We know that a few weirdos from her past have been trying to get back into her life. But all we can do as her friends is give her legal reps the heads up if we think any of them could cause problems for her.\" Spears was seen with Soliz at the Chateau Marmont in LA on Thursday, May 2, a day after her divorce from Sam Asghari was finalized. Following the event, Spears clarified on Instagram that the claims were 'false' and that she intended to relocate to Boston.\n\nCommenting on the same, the insider shared that none of them (Spears' friends) wanted her to go to Boston. He explained, \"...This is the first time we'd heard of it, but she doesn't feel safe in LA. Do any of us trust this Paul guy? No. But she knows she can't trust her parents either. It's easy for predators to target her because they know she doesn't have the protection of her family. But yes, none of us like Paul. We are concerned about her. She needs support and someone who has their eye on her heart and not her hard-earned cash. To some of us, it feels like he came out of nowhere and we don't trust that he isn't just a grifter. Once again, if her parents were stand-up people she could turn to them for guidance but she knows they aren't so she can't.\"\n\nAs reported by Page Six, Soliz faced charges ranging from misdemeanors to a felony. He was found guilty of a dismissed child endangerment charge in 2014, followed by a conviction of driving without a license in 2016. Subsequently, in 2022, he was found liable for felony weapon possession. In September of last year, Soliz insisted in an interview with Backgrid that he was not a horrible man despite the bad press he had received.\n\nHe stated, \"I have custody of my children, I'm not a bad dude...\" Soliz acknowledged being romantically involved with Spears during the interview, but he did not say if their relationship was formal or not. He did, however, characterize Spears as a 'very positive person' who had been a huge source of support for him throughout his legal troubles.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver's_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driver's license"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/691594/uploads/487a1a00-0a14-11ef-9c2b-572fe0c583ed_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 924, "textEnd": 929}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

He also has angry wife and a self-described \"handful\" of children -- as many as 10, his mother-in-law has said. His wife, Nicole Mancilla, told the Daily Mail he cheated on her with Spears and has failed to pay child support for at least five of his children.\n\nMancilla also complained that Soliz still tries to visit her at her mother's home in Sylmar, a suburb north of Los Angeles.\n\n\"He's the EBT Nick Cannon,\" Mancilla told the Daily Mail, referring to Electronic Benefits Transfer cards, which allow people to access government-provided food benefits. Cannon, meanwhile, is the TV host who has 12 children with multiple women.\n\nMancilla told the Daily Mail that Soliz has been living with Spears, but keeps his official residence at a bungalow a few blocks away from her home. Mancilla and her five children live with her mother, 60-year-old surgical assistant Sandra Smith, in Smith's three-bed Sylmar townhouse.\n\n\"He has 10 kids. He doesn't support any of them,\" Smith told the Daily Mail. \"They have a 1-year-old together and he doesn't even pay attention to that one either.\"\n\n\"He's a deadbeat dad,\" Smith continued. \"I wouldn't let him see the kids if it was me. She does, because she wants them to have a dad. But I wouldn't want a dad like that.\"\n\nSoliz's personal life is under scrutiny because he was with Spears last week at the Chateau Marmont, where a woman matching Spears' description created a disturbance by harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests, according to TMZ.\n\nSoliz and Spears then moved to a suite in the famed hotel where they got into a \"big fight,\" during which Spears was screaming and \"out of control,\" leaving guests alarmed that she was having a mental breakdown, TMZ also said. First responders were called, but Spears was photographed, wrapped in a blanket, leaving the hotel on her own.\n\nSpears later tried to downplay the incident on Instagram, denying reports of a fight and saying she twisted her ankle in a fall. But the reports about her wild night at the Chateau Marmont have fueled speculation that the embattled singer is struggling with another serious mental health crisis, blowing through her fortune or is in need of a new conservatorship.\n\nThe Chateau Marmont incident also has put the spotlight back on Soliz. He's been romantically linked to Spears in recent months, following her split from husband Sam Asghari in August, the Daily Mail said. Soliz began working for Spears a year ago, with Us Weekly saying he was hired to do routine maintenance work.\n\nIt's not clear if the relationship is serious, with an insider telling the Daily Mail that they aren't officially dating. \"They had a short fling after Sam left but that was it,\" the insider said.\n\nBut clearly, Spears has continued to associate with Soliz, raising concerns among her friends, Us Weekly said.\n\n\"They have tried for months to tell her to stop associating with him but the more they tell her to stay away, it has the reverse effect,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"She isn't listening to them.\"\n\nUs Weekly also reported that Soliz has a lengthy criminal record, including charges for multiple misdemeanors including disturbing the peace, child endangerment and driving without a license.\n\nIn December 2020, Soliz was arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon and unlawful possession of ammunition, Us Weekly reported. Soliz pleaded no contest, served 90 days in jail and was sentenced to two years probation.\n\nIn September 2023, a reporter for the paparazzi photo agency Backgrid caught up with Soliz outside the San Fernando Superior Court, where he reportedly appeared for a probation violation, the Daily Mail reported. At the time, Soliz insisted he wasn't a \"bad dude.\" He also revealed that he has a \"handful of children\" and that one of the mothers had died.\n\n\"I have custody of my children, I'm not a bad dude,\" Soliz said, according to the Daily Mail. \"I own my own business. I do licensed contractor technique tile.\"\n\nBut Mancilla and her mother have offered a different take on Soliz's approach to parenting, which should add to the concerns of Spears' friends.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that it was not able to find public records confirming that Mancilla and Soliz are married. But the outlet said it found court records showing the Soliz was indeed ordered in March to pay at least $1,100 in monthly child support, plus 50% of healthcare costs, for three children, ages 9 to 21 months. The order was in response to a complaint brought by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family services.\n\nOther court records show that a Los Angeles judge determined in September 2021 that Soliz also was the father of two other children, ages 17 and 6, while he also was the subject of a 2019 complaint from Los Angeles County, saying he should pay $615 in monthly child support for 5-year-old twins he had with another woman.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@mercurynews.com", "name":

Photos from the incident show Spears wrapped in blankets as she left the building, sparking concerns about her mental and physical health.\n\nTMZ also reports the singer is \"completely dysfunctional\" and in danger of going broke.\n\nHowever, Spears herself denied the reports May 2, posting on Instagram, \"The news is fake!\"\n\nShe added, in part, \"Just to let people know I am getting stronger everyday\" and further explained, \"I twisted my ankle last night and paramedics showed up at my door illegally. They never came in my room but I felt completely harassed. I'm moving to Boston!!! Peace\"\n\nWhile we have no idea whether she's serious about moving to Beantown, we do know where Spears currently lives on the West Coast. Spoiler alert: It's a short list. And if she's browsing for a place to buy in Boston, we do know of a site that can help.\n\nFor a pop star who has reached the pinnacle of success, she's done scant work in the real estate department. Even after her release from a controversial arrangement that oversaw her life and money, Spears hasn't dabbled much in mansions.\n\nSet behind two private gates within White Stallion Estates, the enclave offers plenty of privacy. Her five-bedroom residence features a two-story entry, great room with a 35-foot ceiling, an oak-paneled library, a formal living room, dining room, chef's kitchen, and breakfast room. High-end perks include a 3,500-bottle wine cellar, an elevator, and a huge media/game room.\n\nParklike grounds include a lighted tennis court, an infinity pool, a spa, an orchard, and a three-green golf course. A detached pool house with a full kitchen and bath is included, too.\n\nShould Spears want to stay put and branch out, the property she owns comes with two additional building pads. Perhaps she could add a recording studio or a dance studio.\n\nThe \"Circus\" singer had a fling with a property in the double-gated and celebrity-friendly Calabasas neighborhood.\n\nShe purchased a mansion for a hefty $11.8 million in June 2022, then turned around and sold it eight months later at a loss -- for $10.1 million.\n\nSpears snagged the swanky, 1.6-acre spread shortly after her nuptials to actor Sam Asghari.\n\nThe two divorced after just 14 months, and Spears opted to part ways with the property, too.\n\nThe 11,650-square-foot mansion she left behind has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms. Built in 2009, the single-level residence features arched hallways, custom candelabras, and a 33-foot entry foyer wrapped in carved stone.\n\nOther highlights include a chef's kitchen with a breakfast bar and center island, a 10-seat home theater, game room, gift-wrapping room, wet bar, and an office with a coffered ceiling. The home is equipped with smart technology and a camera system. A luxe primary suite comes with dual dressing areas, walk-in closets, a walk-in safe, and a gym.\n\nOn the grounds, there's a mosaic-tiled pool, a hot tub, and multiple waterfalls. There's also a heated patio, an outdoor kitchen, a one-bedroom guesthouse, and a four-car garage.\n\nFollowers of the pop princess might be heartened to know that her childhood home in Kentwood, LA, is still available for $1.2 million. It landed on the market last October and grabbed plenty of attention, becoming the most popular home on Realtor.com\u00ae.\n\nThe house where the superstar spent her formative years is in its original condition, which means that certain childhood mementos in her room remain.\n\nThis 2,3000-square-foot \"piece of music history\" sits on a 1.8 acre, \"park-like\" parcel. The three-bedroom abode includes gems such as Britney Spears stickers and a VIP pass from the 'N Sync World Tour '98 in one of the bedrooms. The original dance studio where the aspiring performer once practiced is also intact.\n\nWill a fan eventually snag this \"unique opportunity\" to live in the home where \"Britney's remarkable career took root,\" as the listing notes?", "source": {"uri": "realtor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Realtor.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "claudine_zap@realtor.com", "name": "Claudine Zap", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation_room", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreation room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_cellar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine cellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_pool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infinity pool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabasas,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSYNC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NSYNC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentwood,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentwood, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentwood, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse_Miniatures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse Miniatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://na.rdcpix.com/85e886f408c212fb257fd5cc7a40f402w-c2142954261srd_q80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 458, "textEnd": 463}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

The Zoey 101 star took to Instagram on Saturday, 4 May to pay tribute to her mum Lynne on her birthday.\n\nJamie Lynn, 33, marked Lynne's 69th birthday with a sweet photo on Instagram. Mum of three Lynne could be seen posing with Jamie Lynn's two daughters - Maddie, 15, and Ivey, six.\n\n\"Happy birthday to my beautiful mama,\" I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! star Jamie Lynn penned. \"She has a childlike spirit that brings magic to everything she does, and we are so blessed to have her.\"\n\nJamie Lynn's post comes after it was reported that her older sister Britney, 42, had been rushed to an ambulance in Los Angeles after allegedly sustaining an injury. She was spotted exiting a Los Angeles hotel barefoot shortly before being rushed to an ambulance on Thursday, 2 May.\n\nAt around 1 am on Thursday morning Britney was seen looking dishevelled as she was escorted out of the Chateau Marmont hotel. In pictures taken at the scene, the 42-year-old was seen wearing very little clothing and covering herself up with a blanket and pillow as her security guard escorted her into a waiting ambulance.\n\nBritney was reportedly caught up in an argument with her ex Paul Richard Soliz, reports the Daily Mail. A stretcher was later seen being wheeled out of the hotel that carried the star's belongings.\n\nBrian Humphrey, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department later confirmed to the Mail, that an ambulance had been called to reports of an injured female, but the patient did not require transportation to hospital. He said: \"Emergency services received a call at 12.42am with reports of an adult female injured. At 1am an ambulance arrived on the premises. I can confirm no-one was transported. Services left the scene at 1.17am. The police department were not called.\"\n\nIn addition to the ambulance dash, Britney herself also worried fans further when she posted a concerning Instagram message in which she claimed the photos featured a \"body double\" and proudly declared she was \"getting stronger every day.\"\n\nIn a now deleted post, Britney wrote: \"Just to let people know ... the news is fake !!! Most of the pics are body doubles and I think most know that !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday !!!

It's unclear exactly how the injury occurred, but she reportedly was in a huge fight with her on-and-off boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz.\n\nThe whole thing was a dramatic mess, and it's only gotten worse as fans have read her versions of events on social media. She claimed \"body doubles\" in the pics, then switched to blaming mom Lynn Spears for setting her up.

The #FreeBritney movement eventually resulted in Spears being released from her fathers conservatorship after a lengthy court battle. But that hasn't stopped bizarre and often troubling stories from coming out about the pop sensation. Most recently is a concerning report delivered by TMZ, they claim that she is approaching bankruptcy and not doing well mentally.\n\nThey claim to have an insider with intimate knowledge of Spears' situation. They claim that she is in a dysfunctional place mentally while also accusing her of having dramatic mood swings. Later in the article the publication claims that she also isn't in a good place financially. She reportedly takes private jet vacations to places like Hawaii and French Polynesia. That combined with legal fees she's been paying out to courts, lawyers, and even her own father and she's reportedly in dire straight financially. Check out the full report they shared below.\n\nMuch of the recent news surrounding Britney Spears spawned from her memoir which released last year. In it she told previously unheard stories from her time in the spotlight as one of the biggest stars in all of music. One person who was painted in a particularly bad light by the memoir was Justin Timberlake. She discussed stories like the fellow pop-star getting her pregnant, which led to a harrowing abortion. She also discusses being broken up with by text while on set filming a movie.\n\nTimberlake eventually had to turn off his Instagram comments following the memoir's release after backlash from Spears' fans became overwhelming. Though he did make somewhat of an apology to her, earlier this year he seemingly retracted it during a performance.

It hurts quite a bit when you have a severe ankle sprain,\" the podiatrist explained.\n\nDespite it being a common occurrence, the expert warned that Britney could experience more issues if the wound doesn't heal properly.\n\n\"The issue is that if a lateral ankle sprain doesn't mend properly, it creates a kind of foot instability. If you have an ankle injury, you can have a high-low ankle sprain injury,\" they went on.\n\n\"You can also have peroneal tendonitis or a peroneal tendon injury or injure your deltoid ligaments, which are the area around the front of the ankle. You can also fracture the bones around the ankle area,\" the podiatrist added.\n\nThey further explained that there are three grades of an ankle injury, and Britney's doesn't appear to be the least severe.\n\n\"It's really hard to tell without seeing how Britney is walking or [having] further information of how badly [it hurts], but it's definitely not a grade one (the least severe). It's likely to be a grade two,\" meaning there's \"some destruction of the ligaments with a bit of swelling and moderate pain.\"\n\nThe expert then said that further examination, including MRI scans and other testing, would be necessary to determine the severity of Britney's injury.\n\nThey said, for now, \"the main thing is really to rest it, ice it, put anti-inflammatory [medicine] on it, and elevate the foot to reduce swelling.\"\n\nThe podiatrist also suggested that the Stronger singer take Ibuprofen and painkillers to lessen her discomfort, and she might need to stay off her foot while she's on the mend.\n\nHowever, they said the real test would be later, as the mother of two might need other, more extensive treatments.\n\n\"If there is severe damage, Britney may need bone reconstruction or tendon transfers. These would need to be done by a podiatric surgeon.\"\n\nThe expert furthered, \"Grade two, hopefully, with resting, icing, compression, elevation, taking painkillers, Ibuprofen, and then [undergoing] rehabilitation, Britney's ankle and foot will be back to normal and with full function.\n\n\"If the ankle sprain is severe, with ligament dislocation and breaking of bones and things like that, then it would need more time for rehabilitation,\" they concluded.\n\nBritney revealed how her injury happened in the comments of her Instagram post, where she shared the videos.\n\n\"I really twisted my ankle last night like an idiot just to show proof. Don't look at my feet I need a manicure,\" the entertainer wrote.\n\n\"It's so bad. F***ing idiot here tries to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau and I fell, embarrassed myself and that's it.\n\n\"Paramedics came to my door illegally, of course, caused this huge scene which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice.\n\n\"It is actually pretty bad but s**t happens.\"\n\nBritney also praised her lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, for \"getting her through\" her injury while blaming her mother, Lynn, who she claimed called her immediately after the incident.\n\nTMZ previously reported that Britney got into a fight with her boyfriend and that a woman matching the star's description was supposedly harassing and threatening the hotel employees and its guests.\n\nThe incident happened Wednesday night at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFans expressed their concern for Britney - who was released from her 13-year-long conservatorship in 2021 - and her mental health on social media.\n\n\"Get someone to look at that injured ankle, please!\" one person begged on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"It's horrible that Britney needs extensive mental health treatment, likely inpatient, but she feels so betrayed and understandably terrified of mental health services she won't seek help.\n\n\"It's just got disaster all written over it; it's so scary,\" another person wrote in an online thread.\n\nA third said, \"I really feel for her and want her to be happy. Her family and fame have clearly caused her deep trauma, but she also clearly isn't mentally stable.\"", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "courtney_ciandella@the-sun.com", "name": "Courtney Ciandella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "emma_bussey@the-sun.com", "name": "Emma Bussey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deltoid muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tendinopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-inflammatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibuprofen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analgesic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Rosengart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mathew Rosengart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint dislocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/05/OFF-PLAT-JS-bs.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

She fought a conservatorship in court, she just went through a divorce, and most recently was involved in a case of an alleged domestic disturbance at a hotel in Los Angeles. Those paying attention will know Spears' problems with her family are well documented, so it's maybe not surprising that the star has been spending a lot of time and money on vacation over the last several months. However, many are worrying that Spears is spending too much and, now, one of the star's peers, Jessica Simpson, has spoken out about just how expensive those vacays can get.\n\nNotably, Jessica Simpson has been spotted on vacation on more than a few occasions over the years. While chatting with TMZ, the former teen idol was recently asked about Britney Spears' apparent lavish spending on her outings. While Simpson never mentioned the pop star by name, she did make a point to say that not every vacation that she's been on recently was on her own dime. She also admitted that it's \"easy to blow all your money on vacation,\" though she further mentioned why it may be worth it:\n\nAs the resident CinemaBlend theme park reporter, I can certainly understand how quickly expenses can get out of hand when on vacation. Whether you're in Hawaii or Disney World, when you're on vacation, you want to have a fun, potentially relaxing time. Often the best way to accomplish that is to spend money and, when you have more money, you're likely more willing to spend more of it. Per recent reports, the \"Toxic\" singer has spent so much on recent vacations that some actually fear she could go broke.\n\nJessica Simpson's comments here seemingly indicate that such a situation is possible. We may be able to assume she's speaking from at least some experience. She's clearly able to take all the vacations she takes, perhaps because she hasn't had to pay for everything. However, Simpson's also probably spent more than she should now and then. We've all done that, even if the scale is different.\n\nBritney Spears has reportedly been taking multiple trips to Hawaii and French Polynesia, with vacations reaching six and even seven figures per excursion. she's reportedly worth an estimated $60 million so, in the grand scheme of things, she can theoretically afford these trips. But it's unknown what sort of income the former pop star currently has, so it can't be said for sure that the money couldn't go out faster than it comes into the point that it runs out.\n\nHowever, some insiders claim Britney Spears has plenty of money coming in, thanks to her successful memoir. If that's the case, then there's not a risk of her going broke. And, if she can spend that much on vacation and still be comfortable, good for her. If only we were all so lucky.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teen idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polynesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxic (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y6N5Be6vUeEeJDJ8baMk8d-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

And his baby momma ain't staying quiet about it!\n\nSince her marriage with ex-husband Sam Asghari started to crumble last summer, we've been following Britney's romance with her former housekeeper and convicted felon Paul Richard Soliz. But a criminal history isn't the only thing he's seemingly trying to leave behind...\n\nOn Monday, Paul's wife (?!?) Nicole Mancilla told DailyMail.com he CHEATED on her with the pop star! She's accusing Brit of being a homewrecker? Well, we wouldn't got that far... Her gripes all seem to be with Paul She also says they share five kids for whom he hasn't coughed up child support! Whoa! She told the outlet:\n\n\"Just let them know that my husband fell in Britney Spears' p***y. He was married, and now he denies his children. He neglects his children for her.\"\n\nWhile court records confirming their nuptials have not been located as of yet, Nicole definitely refers to him as her husband. She also calls her baby daddy \"the EBT Nick Cannon.\" LOLz! But also... YIKES if true!\n\nRelated: Britney Spears & Sam Asghari's Key Divorce Details Revealed!\n\nAnd while Paul and Britney enjoy the Circus singer's mansion and cause commotion at fancy LA hotels, Nicole and the kids apparently lives in Sylmar in a three-bedroom townhouse with her mom Sandra Smith. She also said her estranged hubby keeps his official residence separate from Britney's, even though he may spend TONS of time with her. Why? To avoid issues with his probation:\n\n\"He's on probation, so if he officially lives at her house, they have access to searching her house. So that's why he still has an address here.\"\n\nNicole's mom called him \"a deadbeat dad\" claiming \"he has ten kids\"! Sandra told the outlet:\n\n\"He has ten kids. He doesn't support any of them. They have a one-year-old together and he doesn't even pay attention to that one either.\"\n\nWhoa! She added:\n\n\"He's a deadbeat dad. It's difficult for me, because he doesn't support not one kid. And they're at my house. Nicole's torn up by everything. This has been going on for five years. And he doesn't leave her alone, he keeps coming back. I wouldn't let him see the kids if it was me. She does, because she wants them to have a dad. But I wouldn't want a dad like that.\"\n\nThat's messed up!\n\nWell, we know he definitely has a few kiddos! DM obtained court docs showing the Department of Child Support Services filed a civil suit against him in March, ordering him to pay $1,167 per month plus 50 percent of healthcare for Trystan Alexzander Soliz, 9, Dylan Andrew Soliz, 8, and Violet Pearl Soliz, 21 months. Violet would be the 1-year-old Sandra mentioned.\n\nIt seems there has been some issues regarding parentage, too, as an LA judge confirmed Paul's paternity of Trystan and Dylan, as well as Cesar Martinez-Mancilla, 17, and Nicholas Soliz, 6, in 2021. Violet's paternity has not been confirmed by courts, per the outlet. But that's not all. Another suit was filed against Soliz in 2019 for $615 in monthly child support allegedly owed to Alexandra Gonzalez and their twins, Anevy and Avery Soliz, 5, per the outlet. A 2022 judgment confirmed he was the father there, but the judgment was in his favor -- and said he owed them \"zero.\" Huh.\n\nSo that's seven kids accounted for... According to Nicole's mom, though, he has 10 TOTAL! DM says it was able to confirm nine. So there's still at least two others with other women? We wonder if the same is true for them...\n\nThoughts, Perezcious readers?? Sound OFF in the comments.\n\n[Image via Britney Spears/Instagram]", "source": {"uri": "perezhilton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perez Hilton"}, "authors": [{"uri": "perez_hilton@perezhilton.com", "name": "Perez Hilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Smith_(reporter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Smith (reporter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoa_(Lil_Kim_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whoa (Lil Kim song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadbeat_parent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadbeat parent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Townhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Caesar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/britney-spears-bf-paul-richard-soliz-deadbeat-dad.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536460", "eventUri": "eng-9536460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

Either way, some sh- actually has happened to my foot and I might have to get surgery ... fingers crossed, hopefully not.\"\n\nThe post comes a few days after Spears shared videos of her bruised, swollen foot on the platform shortly after hurting herself at the Los Angeles hotel. As she explained at the time, the \"Toxic\" singer had attempted a risky leap in the Marmont's living room in the early morning of May 2, resulting in what she then believed was a twisted ankle.\n\nThe incident was reported to the local fire department at around 12:42 that morning, and an ambulance was dispatched to the hotel. Photos from the scene captured the musician exiting the building barefoot alongside rumored boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz, after which the LAFD confirmed to Billboard that paramedics had departed around 1:17 a.m. without any indication of whether they ever encountered or treated Spears.\n\nTouching on her appearance in the photos from the night, Spears wrote in her new post, \"I was in my pajamas and yes, I had been crying because I hurt my foot !!! No breakdown !!!\"\n\nShe added, \"I'm a grown a- woman who is actually very naive in most situations !!!\"\n\nBased on Spears' latest update, her foot injury is more serious than she first believed it to be. In an earlier post, she'd told followers, \"Paramedics came to my door and, of course, caused this huge scene, which was so unnecessary, and all I needed was ice.\"\n\n\"Psss this man is wonderful !!!\" the Woman in Me author had added at the time, sharing a photo of her longtime lawyer Mathew Rosengart. \"He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!!

Fans on social media responded to the error with humorous comments as the picture became viral on X.\n\nThe error that occurred during the broadcast reminded me of previous remarks that likened Pandya's way of life and demeanour to that of a normal Caribbean cricket player.\n\nPandya's brother, Krunal, once humorously noted, \"If you see a picture of Hardik as a child, you would think that this kid is from the Caribbean, not an Indian kid.\" This sentiment was echoed by former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who remarked in a 2018 interview, \"I met Hardik Pandya the other day, it seemed like he is Jamaican-born. He can't be from Baroda!\"\n\nPandya's current form has been talked about a lot despite the confusion. Before the T20 World Cup, Pandya's IPL 2024 performance had been lacklustre, both as a bowler and a batsman. But he showed everyone his abilities in the warm-up match against Bangladesh, where he scored a rapid forty off just 23 balls and claimed a vital wicket. This was a critical performance as he took over as vice-captain and looked to lead India to yet another T20 World Cup victory.\n\nThe tweet also brought about a welcome shift in the negative feedback Hardik Pandya has received on social media after taking over as Mumbai Indians captain from Rohit Sharma ahead of the 2024 Indian Premier League.\n\nWith his continued vice-captaincy for the 2024 T20 World Cup, Pandya has the responsibility of giving Team India the much-needed balance. In India's warm-up match against Bangladesh, he picked up a wicket and played a magnificent hand of 40 in 23 balls.\n\nHardik Pandya is an essential part of the Indian cricket squad. His pace-bowling ability as an all-rounder provides much-needed balance to the team. He's a great asset since he can close games out with the bat and contribute crucial wickets. It is his role to lead by example and perform consistently, especially now that he has the additional duty of vice-captain.\n\nIndia kickstart their hunt for a second T20 World Cup title on June 5, taking on Ireland in New York.", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roston_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roston Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019\u201320", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019\u201320"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sourav Ganguly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2024/Jun/GPH6QGLb0AAwuEF_665ee1c4b799d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 2377, "textEnd": 2383}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

It's very, very important for the rhythm because once the tournament has started, it goes on,\" Hardik said.\n\n\"It feels very good when you work hard and kind of get some success, and at the same point of time, it's quite exciting to play here (in America).\"\n\nAfter the match, the team's batting coach Vikram Rathour said Hardik was ready to bowl four overs in a match, and the 30-year-old all-rounder, who was dogged by chronic injuries in the not too distant past, said he was focussed on the job at hand.\n\n\"Everything falls into place for people who work hard. And go and spend a lot of time within yourself, identify who you are, back yourself because you know, Hardik at 30 is a much easier job at Hardik at 60,\" he said.\n\n\"From those days, these days are much, much better, try to find out what exactly are you are trying to figure it out in your skill sets especially. That's why I just went, bowled a lot of overs, batted a lot of balls, so in that scenario you realise your potential slowly, and that was my focus,\" Hardik said.\n\nHe was looking forward to India's big-ticket game against Pakistan on Sunday.\n\n\"India-Pakistan has always been very exciting, lot of cheer and buzz, a lot of emotion and a lot of excitement but at the same time, I hope we will be disciplined in that game, one goal as a group is we go and kind of hunt.\n\n\"So, if we can do that, I think it will be a one more nice day for us,\" Hardik said.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Rathour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vikram Rathour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/06/06/article/image/FotoJet - 2024-06-06T210455.038-1717688099969.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Hardik Pandya was questioned about the crowd turnout at the newly built stadium in New York, specifically mentioning Mumbai.\n\nHardik Pandya encountered backlash while leading the Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. MI fans expressed their discontent over Pandya replacing Rohit Sharma as captain. The all-rounder was booed by fans throughout the tournament, including at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.\n\nTo make matters worse, the five-time IPL champions struggled under Pandya's leadership. The Mumbai-based team became the first to be eliminated from the playoff race. Hardik also failed to deliver with both the bat and ball. He scored 216 runs in 14 matches and took 11 wickets at an economy rate of 10.75.\n\nThe 30-year-old cricketer redeemed himself for India in the 2024 T20 World Cup. He scored 40 runs against Bangladesh in India's only warm-up match. The right-arm pacer picked up three wickets for 27 runs against Ireland in four overs. The Men in Blue secured an 8-wicket victory over Ireland in New York on June 5.\n\nA presenter asked Hardik Pandya, \"It feels like Mumbai here in New York. Is it fun?\". The Indian vice-captain stated that an enthusiastic crowd supports Indians worldwide and expressed gratitude for their backing.\n\n\"It's always fantastic to see the crowd always coming and supporting us. We Indians are everywhere. We rule the world so it's good to have so much support. So thanks to them,\" Hardik said.\n\nHardik Pandya showcased his bowling skills by dismissing Lorcan Tucker and Curtis Campher in the match. He became India's joint third-highest wicket-taker in T20 World Cups after removing Mark Adair. He equaled the record of Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan (16 wickets) in the history of the T20 World Cups.\n\nThe Baroda-born cricketer expressed his pride in playing for the country and contributing to World Cups. Hardik Pandya stated that he adjusted his bowling length for the pitch conditions. He emphasized the need for discipline and accuracy on challenging surfaces.\n\n\"Always special to play for the country, always good to play for pride. I have been able to contribute in the World Cups; God has been kind. That was an outstanding effort by Axar; those are the catches when you let your hand-eye coordination in. I really liked the first wicket, don't hit the stumps often as I usually bowl short of a length. I needed to be fuller than back of a length today.

Broadcasters Error Sparks Hilarious Reactions", "body": "Weekly Horoscope For Career And Finance From June 3 - 9: Talk Up Your Ideas, Collaborate With Others, Zodiacs\n\nIn an amusing twist during the post-match coverage of the West Indies vs. Papua New Guinea Group C game at the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup, Hardik Pandya found himself at the center of an unexpected and hilarious gaffe. As viewers tuned in to watch the summary of the match, they were met with the Indian vice-captain Hardik Pandya's image in place of Roston Chase, who had just played a match-winning knock for the West Indies. This blunder by the broadcasters instantly went viral, rekindling old jokes about Pandya's Caribbean-like demeanor and appearance.\n\nThe mix-up during the broadcast brought back memories of past comments comparing Pandya's lifestyle and persona to that of a typical Caribbean cricketer. Pandya's brother, Krunal, once humorously noted, \"If you see a picture of Hardik as a child, you would think that this kid is from the Caribbean, not an Indian kid.\" This sentiment was echoed by former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who remarked in a 2018 interview, \"I met Hardik Pandya the other day, it seemed like he is Jamaican-born. He can't be from Baroda!\"\n\nThe broadcasting error occurred during the summary of the West Indies' thrilling victory over Papua New Guinea. Instead of showing Roston Chase, Brandon King, and other players from the match, the graphics repeatedly displayed Pandya's image. Fans quickly took to social media, sharing screenshots and poking fun at the mistake. One fan quipped, \"Is Hardik Pandya from the West Indies now?\" while another joked, \"Pandya's Caribbean vacation is official!\"\n\nDespite the mix-up, Pandya's recent form has been a topic of much discussion. Leading up to the T20 World Cup, Pandya's performance in the IPL 2024 had been underwhelming, both as a bowler and a batsman. However, in the warm-up match against Bangladesh, he reminded everyone of his prowess by scoring a quickfire 40 off 23 balls and taking a crucial wicket. This performance was crucial as he steps into the vice-captaincy role, hoping to guide India to another T20 World Cup title.\n\nHardik Pandya's role in the Indian cricket team is pivotal. As a pace-bowling all-rounder, he brings much-needed balance to the squad. His ability to finish games with the bat and chip in with important wickets makes him a valuable asset. The onus lies on him to perform consistently and lead by example, especially with the added responsibility of vice-captaincy.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roston_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roston Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_King_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon King (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sourav Ganguly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019\u201320", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019\u201320"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/06/04/1412191-kj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "dateEnd": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 45, "textEnd": 55}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The question was always how badly it would affect the all-rounder in the Men's T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nAfter Hardik Pandya reached New York, where India was going to play their first three group games of the tournament, the speculation was on Hardik's form and how would redeem himself from the struggle.\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup 2024: 'Hardik Pandya Is A Strong Guy' - Ian Bishop\n\nIn India's only warm-up fixture against Bangladesh at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, in New York, the Gujrat-born showed his impressive skills of coming lower down the order and notching up a firing innings, while with the ball, he gave India a vital spell of three overs.\n\nOnce the India vice-captain started to showcase his performances, the whole balance of the side changed and the inaugural champions of the side looked quite fearless in their approach.\n\nIn the practice game, Pandya remained unbeaten on 40 runs in 23 balls, with four over-boundaries, three of which came in successive three balls against left-arm spin. Even when he was introduced into the attack, Hardik bowled in good line and lengths, before showing his class with the ball to finish with a three-wicket haul.\n\nDuring India's opening game of the league fixture against Ireland, on a pitch which was already helping the fast bowlers, with a slow and sluggish looking outfield, it was important for the changing bowlers to keep on taking wickets.\n\nHardik Pandya went through the defense of Lorcan Tucker, before sending back both Mark Adair and Curtis Campher to end with figures of 3/27 in his four overs, including a maiden. This takes the all-rounder to 76 T20I wickets in 93 games, as he is now the joint third highest-wicket taker for India in T20 World Cups.\n\nIndia chased down the low score of 97 quite comprehensively with almost eight overs to spare, and eight wickets in hand. Another biggest positive for the team in New York has been the immense crowd support for the team.\n\nThe broadcast, during the innings break asked him, 'It feels like Mumbai here in New York. Is it fun?'\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup 2024: USA Captain Monank Patel Focuses On His Team's Fearless Approach Against Pakistan\n\n\"It's really fun. It's always fantastic to see the crowd always coming and supporting us. We Indians are everywhere. We rule the world so it's good to have so much support. So, thanks to them,\" Hardik Pandya quite smartly tackled the question by saying,\n\nIt was quite refreshing to see Hardik bowling in his old way, and that's the reason why India could go with both their spin all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, and add their three prolonged pacers Mohammad Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh.\n\n'Always special to play for the country, always good to play for pride. I have been able to contribute in the World Cups; God has been kind. That was an outstanding effort by Axar; those are the catches when you let your hand-eye coordination in.\n\nI really liked the first wicket, don't hit the stumps often as I usually bowl short of a length. I needed to be fuller than back of a length today. On this kind of surface, you need to be disciplined and hit the right areas,\" Gujrat-born 30-year-old all-rounder Hardik Pandya expressed during the interview.\n\nIndia will now face Pakistan at the same ground on June 09.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type":

Photograph: BCCI / X\n\nHardik Pandya, India's star all-rounder, has expressed his confidence in the team's bowling attack, led by the experienced Jasprit Bumrah, to carry them through the T20 World Cup.\n\nHe highlighted the unit's experience, intensity, and strong team spirit as key factors in their success. India kicked off their campaign with a dominant eight-wicket victory over Ireland.\n\nPandya emphasized the vast experience within the bowling group, boasting a combined total of 892 T20 matches. He singled out Bumrah, the world's No. 1 ranked bowler, as a pillar of strength, alongside the recent brilliance of Mohammed Siraj and the consistent development of young talent Arshdeep Singh.\n\n\"So we have a lot of experience, especially in bowling where we have someone like Jasprit Bumrah, who is the number one bowler by far. We have (Mohammed) Siraj, who has been tremendous in recent years,\" Pandya added, attributing some of their success to the positive team dynamic, \"\"There is a lot of experience, lot of honesty within the bowling core group, and the wicket has also helped a lot today (Wednesday),\"\n\nHe acknowledged the helpful nature of the pitch with its variable bounce and seam movement, which aided the bowlers in their performance. Expressing delight at the winning start, Pandya stressed its importance for building momentum throughout the tournament. He spoke of the team's excitement to be playing in America and the satisfaction of seeing their hard work pay off. Following the match, batting coach Vikram Rathour confirmed Hardik's readiness to bowl his full quota of four overs.\n\nThe all-rounder, who battled chronic injuries in the past, emphasized his focus on the present and the importance of self-belief. \"Hardik at 30 is a much easier job than Hardik at 20,\" he stated, reflecting on his personal growth and the dedication he's invested in honing his skills. This approach, he explained, involves extensive practice to fully understand his capabilities. Looking ahead, Pandya expressed his anticipation for the high-voltage India-Pakistan clash on Sunday.\n\nHe acknowledged the intense emotions surrounding the match but urged his team to maintain discipline and focus on their collective goal. With a potent bowling attack brimming with experience and a clear focus on teamwork, India, under Hardik Pandya's confident leadership, looks well-positioned for a strong run in the T20 World Cup.\n\nAs with all the entire cricketing fraternity, the upcoming tie against Pakistan was very much on his mind.\n\n\"India-Pakistan has always been very exciting, lot of cheer and buzz, a lot of emotion and a lot of excitement but at the same time, I hope we will be disciplined in that game, one goal as a group is we go and kind of hunt.

Pandya's all-round game is hugely important for Team India's balance at the 2024 T20 World Cup. But performances aside, little moments on the field are also helping Hardik win back support. On Wednesday, during India's first T20 World Cup game against Ireland, Pandya was seen giving a hug to Virat Kohli, as the two shared smiles. Fans on the internet were quick to lap up the wholesome moment. After Arshdeep Singh dismissed Paul Stirling in the first ball of the third over, Pandya is seen going up to Kohli during the celebrations to give him a hug, before the two share smiles and laughter.\n\nMoments later, the clip went viral on X, with fans celebrating the bond between the two India stalwarts.\n\nHardik Pandya has started the 2024 T20 World Cup in great form. Despite a disappointing IPL upon his return to the Mumbai Indians, Hardik slammed 40 off 23 balls in the warm-up game, before picking up three wickets in the game against Ireland.\n\nOn a pitch with uneven bounce in New York, Hardik's bowling form has given Team India the option to use a fourth seamer.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hardik and co. bundled out Ireland for just 97. Pacers dominated, as Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh picked two wickets each, while Mohammad Siraj got one.\n\nRohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant ensured that India cruised to victory in just 12.2 overs. The captain, in particular, looked in fine knick, scoring the 30th T20I half-century of his career.\n\nVirat Kohli missed out on contributing big, but will be looking to make amends in the highly-anticipated clash against Pakistan on Sunday, June 9.

That's not enough; Hotstar made an even broader gaffe, as Hardik's photo was seen over every player on the West Indies vs Papua New Guinea match scorecard.\n\nApart from Chase, West Indies batter Brendon King, all-rounder Andre Russell, PNG's Sesa Bua, and Assad Vala's stats were shown with the image of the Indian all-rounder Pandya, wearing the old dark blue jersey.\n\nThe broadcaster's blunder quickly caught the attention of fans across the world, sparking a flurry of reactions on social media, with many users expressing their disbelief and amusement at the bizarre error by sharing screenshots of that scorecard.\n\nAfter this incident, Kruna Pandya's admission on Season 3 of the YouTube series 'What the Duck' went viral, where he drew comparisons between Hardik's appearance and the vibrant Caribbean lifestyle.

The IPL is now a thing of past, and if there was ever a more opportune time for Hardik to redeem himself, it's now, with the T20 World Cup underway. Thus far, Hardik has ticked all boxes. He scored a blazing 40 against Bangladesh in the warm-up game and followed it with figures of 3/27 against Ireland. If his current frame of mind is anything to go by, Hardik is recovering well on his path to redemption.\n\nHardik's mind would have remotely harked back to the Wankhede jeering when, after the match, he was asked by the broadcaster, \"It feels like Mumbai here in New York. Is it fun?\" referring to the number of Indian that had turned up to watch the game. But whatever little jitters Hardik may have had, he shook them off and handled the question like a pro.\n\nAlso Read: Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya dubbed 'best buds' after wholesome moment steals the show during India vs Ireland T20WC match\n\n\"It's really fun. It's always fantastic to see the crowd always coming and supporting us. We Indians are everywhere. We rule the world so it's good to have so much support. So thanks to them,\" Hardik said.\n\nAs evident, Hardik in India jersey and MI Blues are two different cricketers. One could sense that Hardik is in a much better headspace than he was, say, two weeks ago. With the bat, Hardik brought out the big shots and with the ball in hand, it was almost as if he is resuming from where he had left off in the 2023 ODI World Cup.\n\nHardik first cleaned Lorcan Tucker with a fuller delivery that jagged back in after pitching before getting Curtis Campher out caught behind. Pandya added one more to his wickets tally, getting rid of Mark Adair to become India's joint third-highest wicket-taker in the T20 World Cups. With 16 wickets, he is tied with Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan, with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja ahead of him.\n\n\"Always special to play for the country, always good to play for pride. I have been able to contribute in the World Cups; God has been kind. That was an outstanding effort by Axar; those are the catches when you let your hand-eye coordination in. I really liked the first wicket, don't hit the stumps often as I usually bowl short of a length. I needed to be fuller than back of a length today. On this kind of surface, you need to be disciplined and hit the right areas,\" said Hardik.\n\nHardik's form will be crucial for India if they are to reign supreme over arch-rivals Pakistan in Sunday's blockbuster encounter. The last two times India played Pakistan at the World Cups, Hardik scored a vital 40 off 37 balls in Melbourne and picked up 2/34 in Ahmedabad.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019\u201320", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019\u201320"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Campher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Campher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorcan_Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorcan Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Adair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Adair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irfan_Pathan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irfan Pathan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harbhajan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravichandran Ashwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/06/1600x900/hardik-mumbai-question-screengab_1717653263768_1717653333816.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

That's why I just went, bowled a lot of overs, batted a lot of balls, so in that scenario you realise your potential slowly, and that was my focus,\" Hardik said.\n\nHe was looking forward to India's big-ticket game against Pakistan on Sunday.\n\n\"India-Pakistan has always been very exciting, lot of cheer and buzz, a lot of emotion and a lot of excitement but at the same time, I hope we will be disciplined in that game, one goal as a group is we go and kind of hunt.\n\n\"So, if we can do that, I think it will be a nice day for us,\" Hardik said.\n\n(With PTI inputs)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar highlighted how 'relaxed and relieved' Hardik looks while wearing the India jersey and not the Mumbai Indians blue, having gone through a torrid time in the recently-concluded T20 league.\n\nDue to his poor form in the IPL 2024, Hardik's selection in the T20 World Cup 2024 had also come under scrutiny, with reports suggesting that only a lack of alternatives got him into India's 15 for the marquee event. But, Manjrekar maintains that Hardik deserved a spot in the team, having done so well over the years in ICC events.\n\n\"I have been repeatedly saying, even before this match, if you see Hardik Pandya's performances in World Cups, he played the all-rounder's role very well in the 2019 World Cup, he had a main performance in the India-Pakistan match on the big stage, and see his performance with the bat in the semi-final India lost in Adelaide, he scored 60 runs at a strike rate of 190,\" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.\n\nHardik scored 40 runs off just 23 balls in the practice game against Bangladesh, proving his class and credentials right before India's T20 World Cup opener against Ireland. Then, the all-rounder delivered as a bowler against the Irish.\n\n\"What happened in the IPL was a slight temperamental issue because he was feeling the pressure from outside.

The right-arm seamer dismissed Lorcan Tucker (10 off 13), Curtis Campher (12 off 8) and Mark Adair (3 off 2) as India bundled out Ireland for just 96.\n\nPandya's performance came after a forgettable season in the Indian Premier League 2024 where he failed to impress with both bat and ball. Commenting on his performance, the 30-year-old revealed that he trusted his hard work during tough times and revealed that he toiled hard in the nets.\n\n\"Everything kind of falls into places to people who kind of work hard. Go and spend a lot of time within yourself, identify who you are and back yourself. You know because Hardik at 30 is much easier than Hardik at 16. From those days to these days I'm much much better. Try to find out what exactly you're trying to figure out in your skill set especially. That's why I just went and bowled a lot of overs and batted a lot of balls. In that scenario, you realize your potential slowly and that was my focus,\" said Pandya in in a video released by BCCI.\n\nFurther speaking ahead, Pandya expressed excitement ahead of the India vs Pakistan clash and said that the team will be aiming to achieve one collective goal during the game.\n\n\"India Pakistan has been always very exciting with a lot of cheer and buzz. A lot of emotions and excitement from us but also at the same point of time that will be ten times from the fans and all the people who will be watching. I think before even we play the game, in the hotel we start feeling the India-Pakistan game before. Looking forward to it, I hope we are disciplined in that game. One goal as a group we go and kind of hunt. If we can do that it will be one more nice day for us,\" he added.\n\nPandya has a brilliant record against Pakistan having put up remarkable performances with both bat and ball against the arch-rivals. In the previous encounter between the two teams during the T20 World Cup 2022, Pandya put his all-round skills on display by first picking 3/30 with the ball and later scored a crucial 40 (37) with the bat.

Is it fun?\" referring to the number of Indians that had turned up to watch the game.\n\nBut Hardik handled the question like a pro, saying, \"It's really fun. It's always fantastic to see the crowd always coming and supporting us. We Indians are everywhere. We rule the world so it's good to have so much support. So thanks to them.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Hardik first cleaned Lorcan Tucker with a fuller delivery that jagged back in after pitching before getting Curtis Campher out caught behind. He added another one to his wickets tally by getting rid of Mark Adair to become India's joint third-highest wicket-taker in the T20 World Cups. With 16 wickets, he is tied with Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan, with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja ahead of him.\n\n\"Always special to play for the country, always good to play for pride. I have been able to contribute in the World Cups; God has been kind. That was an outstanding effort by Axar; those are the catches when you let your hand-eye coordination in. I really liked the first wicket, don't hit the stumps often as I usually bowl short of a length. I needed to be fuller than back of a length today. On this kind of surface, you need to be disciplined and hit the right areas,\" said Hardik.\n\nHeading into the big game against Pakistan, Hardik's form will be crucial for India. The last two times India played Pakistan at the World Cups, Hardik scored a vital 40 off 37 balls in Melbourne and picked up 2/34 in Ahmedabad.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankhede_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wankhede Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Campher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Campher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorcan_Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorcan Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Adair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Adair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irfan_Pathan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irfan Pathan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harbhajan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravichandran Ashwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design-2024-06-06T184637.197.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Sunil Gavaskar said:\n\n\"When you are playing for India it's huge. It's humongous. The way he was running in, what was impressive was that he bowled his four overs on the trot. Not that he bowled two overs and took a break. That is a test that also had to be run. He has also come through that test very, very impressively.\"\n\nThe IPL 2024 season presented Hardik Pandya with a difficult situation in which his comeback to the Mumbai Indians was far but seamless. The audience criticised him heavily for taking on the captaincy, and he found it difficult to deliver at his customary high calibre.\n\nIndian Cricket Team will be seen in action against their arch-rivals, Pakistan, on Sunday, June 9, 2024. The anticipation for the match is high, as the star-studded India will face Babar Azam and co., who have a poor track record in ICC events against the giants. The fans are eagerly waiting to witness this intense rivalry once again.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aryan_suraj_chadha@republicworld.com", "name": "Aryan Suraj Chadha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019\u201320", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019\u201320"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rbharatimage/hardik-pandya-celebrates-ind-ban-warmup-t20-world-cup-ap-1200-2024-06-a50d9ebc2d643c27279eab2899068b96-171760342087516_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 1238, "textEnd": 1244}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

In his 4 overs, Hardik took 3 wickets, conceded just 27 runs, and even bowled a maiden over, showcasing his brilliance on the field.\n\nBefore the World Cup, Hardik faced heavy criticism, especially following his transfer back to the Mumbai Indians from the Gujarat Titans. His appointment as captain, replacing Rohit Sharma, angered many Mumbai Indians' fans, leading to him being booed in almost every game of the 2024 IPL season. This negatively impacted Hardik's performance, resulting in a rather average season with both bat and ball.\n\nDespite the scepticism surrounding his selection for the T20 World Cup squad, Hardik silenced his critics with a remarkable spell against Ireland, taking 3 crucial wickets. Social media, which once heavily criticized him, is now abuzz with celebrations of his comeback. Virat Kohli's devoted fans were particularly enthusiastic, backing Hardik and celebrating each of his wickets.\n\nSome fans initially wanted Hardik to remove his headband, but their stance softened once he started taking wickets. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians faced trolling from some supporters. A group of fans believes Rohit Sharma knows how to utilize Hardik's bowling better than Hardik does himself, implying that Hardik bowling powerplay overs for Mumbai Indians ahead of Bumrah was a questionable decision.\n\nBatting first, Ireland was all out for just 96 runs. Arshdeep Singh (2/35 in 4 overs), Mohammed Siraj (1/13 in 3 overs), Jasprit Bumrah (2/6 in 3 overs), along with Hardik Pandya, didn't give any breathing space to Irish batters. They were made to look like novices in front of the swing, seam, and extra bounce produced by the four-pronged attack during the 14 out of 16 overs they bowled.\n\nIn response, riding on Rohit Sharma's 37-ball 52 and Rishabh Pant's gritty 36*, India reached the paltry target of 97 set by Ireland in 12.2 overs with 8 wickets remaining, despite Virat Kohli being dismissed early in the run-chase.\n\nFor more news and current affairs from around the world, please visit Indiatimes News.", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_cricket_team_against_Afghanistan_in_India_in_2018\u201319", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Irish cricket team against Afghanistan in India in 2018\u201319"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2024/Jun/ipiccy_image---2024-06-05T230854835_6660a2d6de68a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

India will be taking on Pakistan in their second game of the tournament. The match between the two arch-rivals will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on Sunday (9th June).\n\nThe stakes are always high when India and Pakistan clash with each other and this time around something similar is expected. The pressure bar is always at the top when the two teams play as the outside noise is too much and the atmosphere is completely different.\n\nIndia will be heading into the game on the back of its terrific performance in the game against Ireland. They won the match by 8 wickets but with New York being a threat to batters and Pakistan having some top-class bowlers, it will be a different battle altogether for the team.\n\nOne of the key players for India going into the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 clash against Pakistan will be Hardik Pandya. The all-rounder always performs when the pressure is high and his performance against Pakistan over the years has been sensational with both bat as well as ball.\n\nHardik Pandya while talking about the clash against Pakistan claimed that there will be a lot of emotions for the team heading into the game but also added that it will be 10 times more for the fans. Speaking to BCCI, he stated:\n\n\"India-Pakistan has been always very exciting with a lot of, you know, cheer and buzz. And a lot of emotions, a lot of excitement from us. But at the same point of time, that will be 10 times X from the fans and all the people who are watching from back home.\"\n\nHardik Pandya further added that the excitement for the game will be there even before the game starts. He stressed the need to be disciplined and was hopeful of winning the game. He added:\n\n\"So, yeah, I think before even we play the game, I think in the hotels we will start feeling the India-Pakistan game before. So, yeah, looking forward to it. I hope we, you know, be disciplined in that game.\n\n\"One goal as a group, we go and kind of hunt. So, if we can do that, I think, you know, it will be one more nice day for us.\"\n\nHardik Pandya has looked in the red hot form in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024. He played a brutal knock with the bat in the warmup game against Bangladesh.

Mumbai Indians finished at the bottom of the points table with just 4 victories from 14 matches and Hardik came under a lot of fire - both as a player and a captain. Hardik's appointment as the Mumbai Indians captain ahead of the tournament was not taken well by a section of the fanbase and the disappointing results led to the crowd booing him at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.\n\nWith the T20 World Cup 2024 just round the corner, questions have once again surfaced over Hardik's form but West Indies legend Ian Bishop believes that his 'strong personality' will be help him shine in the tournament.\n\n\"I think he is a pretty strong personality. I would like to think that the other members of the team would have rallied around him. What he endured during the IPL, some of it was not of his own making. I just wish fans could have approached it maybe a little differently, but they have the right to voice their views however they see fit,\" Bishop said on Star Sports.\n\nEarlier, Hardik slammed an explosive 23-ball 40 for India in the T20 World Cup 2024 warm-up match against Bangladesh on Saturday. As India secured a 50-run win in their only practice match, Hardik opened up on the 'difficult' times he faced over the past couple of months.\n\n\"Eventually, I believe, you have to stay in the battle. Sometimes life puts you in situations where things are tough, but I believe that if you leave the game or the field, the battle that is, you won't get what you want from your sport, or the results you are looking for,\" Hardik said.\n\n\"So, yeah, it has been difficult, but at the same time, I have been process-driven, I have tried to follow the same routines I used to follow earlier,\" he said on Star Sports.\n\n\"At the same time these things happen; there are good times and bad times, these are phases that come and go.

In the 2022 T20 World Cup encounter against Pakistan, Hardik took 3/30 before smashing a match-winning 40. The match went down to the wire as India chased down 160. Notably, Hardik has the joint-most T20I wickets for India against Pakistan.\n\nAlthough Hardik has just 84 runs from six T20I innings against Pakistan, his cameos have been impactful. Hardik's 37-ball 40 in the 2022 T20 World Cup encounter stood out. During the match, Hardik became the 10th Indian to complete 1,000 runs in T20I cricket. He also became the first Indian and eighth player overall to score 1,000 runs and take 50 wickets in T20Is.\n\nHardik's best bowling figures against Pakistan came in the 2016 Asia Cup clash in Mirpur.

Ahead of their first game, they clean swept Bangladesh in their one and only warm-up match, which has set the tone for the bigger matches coming ahead.\n\nWith a night dominated by the bowlers, Indian vice-captain Hardik Pandya, who too performed remarkably well in the game, has lavished praise on the core bowling group consisting of pace spreadhead Jasprit Bumrah, young gun Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj. Pandya has said that there is a lot of honesty and experience within the core bowlers of the Indian team and that's what makes them special.\n\nAdditionally, he also said that a perfect blend of hard work and success is what they should strive for and achieving success with a lot of hard work in the opening game against the Irish side is what will make their stay in the US pleasing.\n\n\"We were told today that within the group we have 892 T20 games, that's a lot of games. So we have a lot of experience, especially in bowling where we have someone like Jasprit Bumrah, who is the number one bowler by far. We have Mohammed Siraj, who has been tremendous in recent years,\" Hardik said during a chat with the BCCI.TV.\n\n\"We have Arshdeep, who has played the last two World Cups and has been quite fantastic and making sure that he keeps getting better. There is a lot of experience, lot of honesty within the bowling core group, and the wicket has also helped a lot on Wednesday,\" he added.\n\nThe seam-bowling all-rounder said the team was very pleased to start the tournament on a positive note.\n\n\"We are very happy and very pleased to the kind of start on a good note. It's very, very important for the rhythm because once the tournament has started, it goes on. It feels very good when you work hard and kind of get some success, and at the same point of time, it's quite exciting to play here in America,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sumit_channa@news9live.com", "name": "Sumit Channa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Siraj", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Siraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hardik-Pandya-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627923", "eventUri": "eng-9627923", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 239721098, "title": "Gary Lineker's foul-mouthed England and Gareth Southgate verdict speaks volumes", "text": "Gary Lineker has labelled England\u2019s performance against Denmark as \u201cs***\u201d in a brutal rant on Gareth Southgate\u2019s tactical ability as manager. England could only draw with the Danes in a drab 1-1 result in Frankfurt which opened up Southgate to heavy criticism. Harry Kane opened the scoring from close range before the Three Lions retreated into their shell and were powerless to prevent Morten Hjulmand from powering in a long-range effort to equalise. Southgate selected the same XI which managed a narrow 1-0 win over Serbia in their Euro 2024 opener, only to see the problems from that match exacerbated. With the team so deep, England\u2019s front four of Kane, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham didn\u2019t get into the game and the ball was constantly given away cheaply. England are still in control of their fate, sitting top of Group C ahead of their final match against Slovenia on Tuesday, but a convincing win is needed in Cologne. Lineker did not pull his punches when assessing the performance of the players and the approach from Southgate on the Rest is Football podcast with Micah Richards. \u201cI mean, you can think of all sorts of words and expletives if you like, but it was s***,\u201d Lineker said. \"Was it tactically inept? It's really hard to be critical of Gareth Southgate, because overall in the England role he's turned England's fortunes around in many ways. \"Having said that, he's kind of ended up adopting a really talented bunch of players. We've done a semi-final of a World Cup, a final of a European Championships, quarter-final of the subsequent World Cup \u2013 where to be honest we were a little bit unlucky. He's an amazing leader, he's a great communicator, he's transformed the public's opinion of the national team and the players and stuff like that. He's been brilliant on that. \"But tactically, the first game...and we've seen it in other tournaments as well where England kind of start OK, and then get a goal and then everything changes. It's almost like those tactics of get a lead, hang onto it \u2013 and the game's moved on from that hasn't it?\" Southgate was disappointed with the performance against Denmark and is set to change things up for Slovenia. \u201cThe way we are playing isn\u2019t about an individual player. We\u2019ve got to play better as a group,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my responsibility to find better solutions and it is my responsibility for the results and we have to work intelligently to find ways to press the ball better and keep the ball better.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re in an intense arena and have to find a way of embracing that, walking towards the challenge and understanding what it is and playing in a more composed manner than we have so far. \u201cFor me it is not about individuals. It is about the team and it is my responsibility to sort that out. This is a different environment to anything else and I know that over the years. I have to guide the fellas through that. And it is simple - we have to play better than we are at the moment.\u201d Join our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

But he also has emotional intelligence, knows how to create a team ethic and plays attractive football.\n\nFeyenoord coach Arne Slot has emerged as Liverpool's favoured candidate to succeed Jurgen Klopp - with talks between the two clubs underway\n\nAtletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone tried to pick a fight with Slot after a friendly in 2021\n\nIn response to being shoved, the Stone Island-wearing Slot just smiled back at Simeone\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by The Hooligan Scene \ud835\udd73 (@thehooliganscene)\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nSo there are reasons both for and against his suitability for the unenviable task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool open talks with Feyenoord after identifying Arne Slot as the ideal candidate to succeed Jurgen Klopp... as Reds face \u00a38.5m compensation fee to land the Dutchman Advertisement\n\nSlot, 45, who has just backed up last season's Eredivisie title win by delivering the KNVB Cup to Rotterdam, has emerged as a strong contender for the Anfield gig.\n\nIndeed, on Wednesday morning it emerged talks have already begun between Liverpool and Feyenoord with the compensation fee set at \u00a38.5million.\n\nOn the face of it, Slot's 4-3-3 formation, intensity of pressing and high energy attacking bears many resemblances to Klopp's 'heavy metal' (Slot is more into his rap music).\n\nBut the Liverpool vacancy requires so much more that just a good tactician.\n\nFor nine years, Klopp has carried not only a club but at times a city defiant in its own identity and independence.\n\nThat emotional burden has ultimately caught up with him but not before he won the biggest honours in the game.\n\nLiverpool's new manager must not only perform in Klopp's lingering shadow but somehow keep up his boundless energy and forge the same bonds with a demanding fanbase and players that aren't his own.\n\nThe experiences of David Moyes and Unai Emery, after Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, have shown just how difficult it is to follow a manager of legendary stature.\n\nSucceeding the immensely popular Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is an unenviable challenge\n\nSlot delivered the Eredivisie league title to Feyenoord last season, their first since 2017\n\nSome would say the man who follows Klopp is on a similar hiding to nothing even if Liverpool fans would surely be sympathetic and patient if there was regression next season.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot has been compared to Pep Guardiola, is 'the most attack-minded coach in the Netherlands since Johan Cruyff' and 'holds all the power at Feyenoord'... what Liverpool fans can expect if he replaces Jurgen Klopp Advertisement\n\nLike Klopp, Slot had a respectable but hardly spectacular playing career at the likes of FC Zwolle and NAC Breda rather than Ajax or Feyenoord.\n\nBut when it comes to coaching, Slot sees no reason to curb his ambitions, even if it has rubbed people up the wrong way.\n\nAZ Alkmaar abruptly sacked him in December 2020 because owner Robert Eenhoorn learned he'd attended a clandestine meeting with Feyenoord and agreed to replace Dick Advocaat.\n\nEven as he wins trophies at Feyenoord, Slot has been unafraid to speak about his personal career trajectory.\n\n'My next step will not be a club in Holland,' he said in 2023. 'If that is my next step, then I've failed completely.\n\n'The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.'\n\nThe Premier League has fluttered its eyelashes back across the North Sea. Crystal Palace were interested and Leeds made Slot their first-choice replacement for Jesse Marsch in February 2023 - though negotiations didn't get going.\n\nTottenham Hotspur thought they'd persuaded him to become their manager in May 2023 before Slot surprisingly decided to stay at Feyenoord and Daniel Levy turned to Ange Postecoglou.\n\nSlot favours attacking, high-energy football - something that would win him favour at Anfield\n\nBut Slot has been able to take control of all aspects of running Feyenoord, which wouldn't be possible at Liverpool\n\nGiven that Slot demands a significant degree of control over all aspects of the club's operations, you wonder how that would have worked with Levy.\n\nThere was friction when he came in at Feyenoord, with a number of scouts and recruitment specialists leaving the club because of how Slot wanted them to work.\n\nHe certainly wouldn't get that control at Anfield, though it's only right he has a big say over recruitment to evolve Liverpool in his image post-Klopp.\n\nThe other big unknown is how Slot would handle the intense scrutiny that would come with the Liverpool job - especially if things are going wrong.\n\nWhile the Dutch media and fans aren't known for holding back in their forthright opinions, Liverpool with their global fame are several levels above Feyenoord in the pressure stakes.\n\nHis time at De Kuip has been predominantly successful - he took them to the inaugural Europa Conference League final, where they lost to Jose Mourinho's Roma, then won a first league title since 2017.\n\nFeyenoord celebrate winning the Dutch Cup after they beat NEC Nijmegen last weekend\n\nPSV Eindhoven have been superior in the Eredivisie this season but Feyenoord beat NEC last weekend to win the Cup.\n\nBut given even a small number of games without a victory can constitute a disaster at Liverpool, Slot hasn't yet been stress-tested in this way.\n\nIndeed, Bayern Munich reportedly looked at and rejected Slot because he doesn't yet have that kind of experience.\n\nWhat he will bring - like Klopp - is relentless positivity. Liverpool fans are already fawning over a video of one of his team talks - delivered in his perfect English - after Feyenoord won 3-2 at Ajax en route to the championship.\n\nSlot would aim to replicate Klopp's passion if he lands the Liverpool gig in the weeks ahead\n\nWhile Slot acknowledged a first victory in Amsterdam for 17 years was a seminal moment, he quickly reminded his players it was 'only one win' and the job wasn't yet done.\n\nYou can certainly hear echoes of Klopp in it and his players were duly crowned champions two months later. By the end, it's apparent his team will run through brick walls for him.\n\nSo Slot certainly brings similarities to Klopp in terms of charisma and motivation, as well as outlook on how his teams should play their football.\n\nThe great unknown is what happens at Liverpool when such a unique figure as Klopp is taken out of the equation.\n\nWhat's clear with Slot, however, is that he certainly wouldn't shirk the challenge if presented with it.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Liverpool's strong relationship with Feyenoord may help seal the deal for Slot despite their initial bid being rejected. Negotiations for Slot included an offer of \u20ac9million, though Feyenoord want more as it could involve backroom staff moving to Anfield.\n\nLiverpool's strong relationship with Feyenoord amid their pursuit of Arne Slot to become their new boss could stand them in good stead when it comes to appointing the Dutchman - and Ben Jacobs has exclusively told GIVEMESPORT that whilst their opening bid has been rejected, Liverpool aren't far off agreeing a deal as they know the release clause.\n\nSlot has come from nowhere as an option to move to Anfield after failed moves for other managers on the market, and with talks ramping up throughout the week, the 45-year-old appears destined to become the new boss of the Premier League title chasers.\n\nArne Slot: Liverpool Manager Latest Arne Slot has been fast-tracked to become Liverpool's top target\n\nSlot has become Liverpool's top target after moves for their previous two ideal candidates broke down. Xabi Alonso was thought to be Liverpool's top target once Jurgen Klopp announced that he would be leaving Anfield, but after two months of speculation, the Spaniard committed his future to Bayer Leverkusen - leaving Liverpool looking for a new manager once again.\n\nSporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim was the man next linked with a move to the red half of Merseyside, and whilst it looked for all the world that he would become the successor to Klopp in the Liverpool throne, reports earlier in the week suggesting that he had flown to London for talks with West Ham coupled with his potential move to Liverpool breaking down saw the club move on once again.\n\nRelated Liverpool and Klopp Disagreed Over Darwin Nunez Signing Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez has come under plenty of scrutiny this season, and Paul Joyce has suggested it was a Jurgen Klopp signing.\n\nSlot is now the man touted to become the new manager, and that has led to reports that Liverpool have opened negotiations with Feyenoord to bring him over. Having won the Dutch Cup last week and with PSV Eindhoven just one win away from securing the Eredivisie, Feyenoord's season is all but over as they are bound to finish in second place - leaving Slot free to undergo contract negotiations with the Reds.\n\nJacobs Says Liverpool Have Good Relationship With Feyenoord Liverpool have supposedly done their business in the correct manner\n\nSpeaking exclusively to GIVEMESPORT, Jacobs said that Liverpool have a better chance at bringing Slot into the club as a result of their strong negotiations with Feyenoord - whilst they know the release clause to bring him to the Premier League. He said:\n\n\"Because they've got a good relationship with Feyenoord, and because they've gone about their approach in the right way - they didn't hold their formal talks or make their first offer until after Feyenoord's cup final victory - which was definitely appreciated by Feyenoord.\n\n\"The expectation from sources is that the compensation is not going to be \u20ac20million. Liverpool's first offer was \u20ac9million but that has been rejected.\n\n\"And as I've reported before, I was always told that \u20ac10million plus was the starting ballpark potentially rising up to \u20ac15million. If, as would be expected, a significant number of backroom staff join Slot in making the move to Anfield.\"\n\nSlot Would Be a Good Addition at Liverpool Many have aired concerns but Slot is a top candidate\n\nWith Alonso and Amorim out of the picture, Slot has been analysed by many in the past few days and by playing a similar style to Klopp, it would mean that there would be less of a rebuild in the summer.\n\nWith Slot also likely to take his backroom staff to Anfield, his ideas and playing style would get across quicker, allowing Liverpool to hit the ground running at the start of next season. Of course, there will be some teething problems, but in terms of an immediate appointment that would fill fans with hope and continuity going forward, there wouldn't be many better than Slot to start with.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

Slot is now pushing for a move to happen, with further talks planned this week.\n\nLiverpool are in the market for a new manager to replace Jurgen Klopp, with Feyenoord boss Arne Slot emerging as a candidate. According to Dutch outlet 1908, Slot has already started to look for houses in the Merseyside area, and he is preparing to take his family to the North West of England.\n\nKlopp announced that he would be heading through the exit door at the end of the season, giving the likes of Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes plenty of time to draw up a list of candidates, with Slot the latest name to be linked with the soon-to-be vacant position.\n\nSlot Looking for Houses in Liverpool He's prepared to move his family to Merseyside\n\nAccording to Dutch outlet 1908, Slot is already looking for houses in Liverpool and is looking to bring his family over to England. The report claims that the 45-year-old is now pushing to make the move happen, with his agent, Rafaela Pimenta now sitting down with the Merseyside club to discuss contract details, with further discussions planned this week.\n\nJournalist Ben Jacobs recently reported that Liverpool will intensify their pursuit of Slot this week with the situation moving fast.

The Dutch outfit also won the KNVB Cup earlier this term, so the 45-year-old coach is no stranger to silverware.\n\nThe Bergentheim-born manager has only managed in his home country so far in his career, which could be a concern for Liverpool due to his lack of experience elsewhere in Europe. It was a similar situation when they hired Klopp, though, with the former Borussia Dortmund boss only plying his trade in Germany.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Arne Slot guided Feyenoord to their 16th Eredivisie title in history in 2023, and their first since 2017.\n\nRelated Who is Arne Slot - Dutch Manager Now Favourite For Liverpool Job A closer look at Arne Slot, the Dutch manager who has emerged as the new favourite to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool.

He signed a new contract last May to keep him at Feyenoord until 2026 but has referenced a desire to make the next step in his career.\n\nSporting manager Ruben Amorim was under consideration by Liverpool but sources say he is no longer in the frame, as it stands.\n\nWest Ham are interested in Amorim but Julen Lopetegui, the former Wolves, Real Madrid and Spain boss, and Paulo Fonseca, currently in charge of Lille, are considered the frontrunners.\n\nSlot took over from Dick Advocaat at Feyenoord for the start of the 21/22 season with the club having finished fifth the previous campaign. Just two years later, they were champions of the Eredivisie. He built a pressing team playing intense, attack-minded football while also being able to win.\n\nFeyenoord are second behind PSV Eindhoven this season, nine points adrift with four games to play. In Europe they finished third in their Champions League group before dropping into the Europa League where they were knocked out by Roma on penalties in February.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan said: \"He is the prime candidate for Liverpool. It was only a matter of time before another big English club would come knocking on the door. He's not only been a successful manager, he's also been hugely impressive with his playing style of very attack-minded, Pep Guardiola-style football.\n\n\"I don't expect Feyenoord to stand in the way. They know he's a manager in demand but they will demand a big compensation fee. He has two years left on his contract that was a record deal.\n\n\"Never before in Dutch football has a team paid a manager such huge wages. The players like him, the fans love him, the club love him - they won't want him to go. Feyenoord have every right to demand a big fee as there is no clause in his contract which he renewed last year.\n\n\"He's been a successful coach and made Feyenoord champions playing crazy, sexy football. It is sexy what this man brings on a football pitch. There's nothing more to win for him here. The next step for him is to enter a club in a big league and no league is bigger for the Dutch than the Premier League. I will be surprised if Slot doesn't bite at this chance and become the manger of Liverpool next season.\"\n\nLast summer, Slot was one of the leading contenders for the then-vacant Tottenham manager's role and Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill went to Rotterdam to cover the story.\n\nCotterill found Slot to be \"engaging, polite, very smiley, he's got presence and charisma - and he's funny\" when writing about his trip to get the lowdown on the Feyenoord boss, who has been open about his desire to manage in the Premier League.\n\n\"My next step will not be a club in Holland,\" he said in May 2023.\n\n\"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nSpurs were determined to get Slot last summer after he secured the Eredivisie title with Feyenoord.\n\nHowever, Slot ruled himself out of the running to take over in north London before signing a new contract at Feyenoord a few days later which runs until 2026.\n\n\"I'm not done here yet,\" Slot said after the announcement of his new deal.\n\nThe potential deal with Spurs never got to any formal stage of discussions with him or Feyenoord and Spurs bosses felt that Slot used their interest in him to get an improved contract in the Netherlands.\n\nAnge Postecoglou was eventually appointed by Spurs from Celtic.\n\nEuropean football expert Andy Brassell told Sky Sports News:\n\n\"Slot is a guy who has got a consistent record of success and playing attacking football over several years. That idea of redeveloping teams and working with younger players as well is something that really appeals to Liverpool.\n\n\"The way he wants to attack would really appeal to Liverpool fans, too. He always wants his teams to find a way to put pressure on the opposition, to press, to score goals, and they do that in Europe as well.\n\n\"No one is quite like Jurgen Klopp in front of the media, but Slot is no shrinking violet at all. We've seen this when his side have played Roma and he's come up against Jose Mourinho. He's not afraid to upset and won't back down.\n\n\"Premier League clubs have known he would fit in well for quite a while. The Premier League has moved more towards possession and front-foot football, so it's probably the right time for Slot.

In that time he has transformed the Reds into one of English football's top teams, winning the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and two Carabao Cups.\n\nKlopp announced his exit in January, with Liverpool having been searching for his successor ever since. That search has been hit by a number of blows, with frontrunner Xabi Alonso ruling himself out of the job.\n\nSporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim was seen as the next leading target, but he has been holding talks with West Ham around their manager's job instead. With Amorim having his eyes elsewhere, Slot has been touted as the ideal candidate.\n\nThe Dutchman has impressed with Feyenoord, leading them to the Eredivisie title last season and the KNVB Cup this year. His work has now led to Netherlands legend Marco van Basten selecting him as the top choice for the Reds.\n\n\"I think he's really good. I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it is an enrichment for Dutch football. He can really go anywhere - Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that,\" Van Basten told Ziggo Sport's 'Rondo'.\n\n\"I've spoken to him a few times and I think what he does and what he sees is very strong. He gets along very well with the group of players, is tactically well-versed, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who should Liverpool appoint as their next manager? Comment below.\n\nThe Reds have been told Feyenoord boss Arne Slot would be the perfect successor to Jurgen Klopp\n\n\"I think he can go to any club, even at the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent. He has a lot of qualities and he shows it at every level. He first did it at AZ, and now at Feyenoord. And Feyenoord is a really complicated club.\n\n\"He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money. He could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football.\n\n\"You can clearly see his hand where he is the coach. I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.\"\n\nSlot previously became a target for Tottenham before they chose Ange Postecoglou. He only signed a new three-year contract with Feyenoord last year and technical director Dennis te Kloese is confident he will remain in his post beyond the summer.\n\n\"I think it is logical that he is in such a good position,\" said Te Kloese via vi.nl. 'It is very special how he has manifested himself in recent years and has really given Feyenoord a face.\n\n\"We responded by extending his contract. In any case, we assume that he will also be our trainer next year.

He is the first choice of Fenway Sports Group chief Michael Edwards and incoming director of football Richard Hughes.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Feyenoord's match against Go Ahead Eagles on Thursday night, the 45-year-old told ESPN: \"I'd like to become new Liverpool manager, my decisions is clear. Feyenoord and Liverpool are in talks to negotiate, I'm waiting to see what will come out of it. I am confident, waiting for the clubs to reach an agreement.\"\n\nTalks are ongoing because Slot has two years left on his Feyenoord deal and it is understood it will cost around \u00a38.6million in compensation for Liverpool to hire him this summer.

But, having failed to reach an agreement with Tottenham last summer, he appears destined for the Premier League.\n\nThat has always been the plan for the ambitious coach, who admitted last year: \"The next step will not be another club in Holland.

They know he's a manager in demand but they will demand a big compensation fee. He has two years left on his contract that was a record deal.\n\n'Never before in Dutch football has a team paid a manager such huge wages. The players like him, the fans love him, the club love him - they won't want him to go.\n\n'Feyenoord have every right to demand a big fee as there is no clause in his contract which he renewed last year.\n\n'He's been a successful coach and made Feyenoord champions playing crazy, sexy football.\n\n'It is sexy what this man brings on a football pitch. There's nothing more to win for him here.\n\n'The next step for him is to enter a club in a big league and no league is bigger for the Dutch than the Premier League. I will be surprised if Slot doesn't bite at this chance and become the manger of Liverpool next season.'\n\nLiverpool made Arne Slot a top target this week after evaluating a host of managers from around Europe.\n\nXabi Alonso was the original first-choice target before he announced his decision to remain with Bayer Leverkusen after guiding them to Bundesliga glory.\n\nSporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim then emerged as a potential option - but he looks more likely to end up at West Ham.\n\nBrighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and Bologna's Thiago Motta were also linked but it is Slot who is now the frontrunner to replace Jurgen Klopp.\n\nArne Slot favours a high-intensity 4-2-3-1 formation in possession, which can be flexible to accommodate attacking players.\n\nHe prefers to have two deep-lying midfielders and a reliance on wingers to create chances.\n\nSlot's teams often dominate possession and play on the front-foot and are known for their pressing.\n\n'We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity,' Slot has said about his own style of football.\n\n'When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.'\n\nLiverpool's back four under Arne Slot is likely to have a very similar look, assuming none of their star defenders leave the club in the summer transfer window.\n\nMohamed Salah, though, has been strongly linked to the Saudi Pro League with West Ham star Jarrod Bowen tipped as one of his potential replacements.\n\nIt's been reported that Slot may decide to sign Atalanta's Teun Koopmeiners in one of his first decisions as Liverpool boss - who he managed at AZ Alkmaar.\n\nMORE : Liverpool to hold formal talks with Feyenoord as Arne Slot

Speaking on Sky Sports' Back Pages podcast on 23rd April, The Athletic's David Ornstein claimed that Slot appears to be Liverpool's first choice appointment:\n\n\"He's definitely a strong candidate. I think he's gone to the top of the bookmaker's lists, and our information is that he appears to be the first choice now, and that's being reported in many of the papers. Arne Slot does have the credentials.\n\n\"He came very close, it seemed, to getting the Tottenham Hotspur job last summer. For whatever reason, he decided against it, and I think finances were also a bit of an issue in terms of paying what it takes, because I don't think there's a release clause in there. If they decide to go for him, that will be something Liverpool will have to get their head around. We've heard figures maybe even a little bit higher, and they will drive a hard bargain because they don't want to lose him.\n\n\"But hopefully, if they go forward with it, it will give the Liverpool fans and the club a little bit of clarity. It doesn't sound like a foregone conclusion, and they will have to talk further. I think there has been contact. Tonight [Tuesday], we're reporting on The Athletic between Liverpool and Slot, but it has not yet been between Liverpool and Feyenoord.

The Dutchman is already considered an excellent manager with a style that could achieve 'special things' at the highest level in the Premier League.\n\nThe Italian claims that, despite reports that Slot has been on the radar of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, he is only aware of contacts with Liverpool as of now, putting the six-time European Cup winners in pole position to wrap up negotiations.

announced his decision in January to stand down at the end of the season after nearly nine years in the role.\n\nHowever, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title.\n\nSporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool vacancy but reportedly held talks with West Ham on Monday about replacing David Moyes next season.\n\nSlot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.\n\nHe led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.\n\nSlot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.\n\nThe Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nKlopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.\n\nLiverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot",

Slot has a successful track record in Dutch football, winning two trophies with Feyenoord in three years. The manager is highly regarded in the Netherlands, even drawing comparisons to Pep Guardiola, and could bring his attack-minded approach to Anfield.\n\nThere's a new favourite in the ever-changing race to succeed Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager for the 2024-25 season. Feyenoord's Arne Slot has emerged as the likely candidate to replace the German when he departs the Merseyside-based club in the summer.\n\nNothing is certain as Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes look to find the ideal replacement for Klopp, who has lifted the Premier League, Champions League and several cup competitions during his nine years at the club. Any boss that takes his place in the dugout will have their work cut out for them to try and live up to the high standards the former Borussia Dortmund manager has brought to Anfield.\n\nXabi Alonso was the name on everyone's lips in the immediate aftermath of the bombshell that Klopp would leave, but the Bayer Leverkusen boss has now been ruled out of the equation. The same goes for Sporting CP manager Ruben Amorim, who looked like the second most likely candidate before being ruled out of the running.\n\nThe new name at the front of the queue is Slot, who has done some incredible work in Dutch football over the past years. We've taken a closer look at the new leading candidate for the Anfield hot seat.\n\nArne Slot vs Jurgen Klopp - Managerial Record\n\nStatistic\n\nArne Slot\n\nJurgen Klopp\n\nGames\n\n206\n\n1073\n\nWins\n\n127\n\n594\n\nWin %\n\n61.7%\n\n55.4%\n\nPoints-per-game\n\n2.06\n\n1.88\n\nRelated How Many Liverpool Games Jurgen Klopp has Left The iconic manager could lead his side to a treble by the end of the season. Arne Slot's Background His rise in the managerial world has been fast\n\nAs a player, Slot enjoyed a respectable career, representing Eredivisie clubs such as NAC Breda and FC Zwolle. He was a midfielder with an eye for goal, netting over 100 times in his playing days. His name has gained much more recognition in the years since he hung up his boots, however, and Slot is now in contention for one of the top jobs in the world.\n\nHe retired in 2013 and took up a role as a coach at PEC Zwolle before moving on to become an assistant coach with SC Cambuur. During his first stint as a first-team boss, Slot was in with a chance of winning the Dutch top flight with his AZ Alkmaar side level on points with Ajax when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the season. As his side were behind on goal difference, they were declared as runners-up when the season was cancelled.\n\nAfter being found to be in discussions with Feyenoord in late 2020, he was sacked from his role at AZ Alkmaar, and he subsequently took over their Eredivisie rivals.\n\nSlot's Success at Feyenoord The Dutch boss has won two trophies in three years\n\nAlthough Feyenoord are set to lose out on the Eredivisie league title in the 2023-24 season, Slot has still been a huge hit since he arrived in Rotterdam in 2021. His debut campaign with the club saw the manager guide his new team into third place, as well as a European final.\n\nJose Mourinho's Roma defeated Feyenoord in the UEFA Europa Conference League final at the end of the 2021/22 season, but to have even gone that far in the competition was an achievement for the club in its own right.\n\nHis second full season was even more fruitful as Slot took his side to domestic glory despite losing nine of the players that lined up in the Conference League final the year before. That shows remarkable adaptability and the football he had his team playing was wonderful for the fans to witness. Feyenoord lifted the KNVB Cup earlier in the 2023/24 season, proving their manager is no stranger to silverware.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Arne Slot guided Feyenoord to their 16th Eredivisie title in history in 2023, and their first since 2017.\n\nRelated The 10 Favourites to Replace Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool Boss (Ranked) Klopp's days at Anfield are coming to an end and there are a handful of interesting names linked with the job Slot is Highly Rated in the Netherlands He's drawn comparisons to Pep Guardiola\n\nWhile he may not be a known quantity to the majority of football fans across Europe, Slot is highly regarded in his homeland. This is shown by the comments from Dutch journalist Marcel van der Kraan in 2023, who claimed (per Sky Sports):\n\n\"He's a really good manager and sometimes it can come fast and quick. I've followed Feyenoord for 40 years. Not since the days of Johan Cruyff at Ajax in the 1980s has there been a coach so attack-minded in the Dutch league. Cruyff only had a few disciples who followed him and one of them was Pep Guardiola.\"\n\nTo be compared in any way to Cruyff and Guardiola is a compliment of the highest order and will be sure to excite Liverpool fans should Slot land the gig at Anfield. Van der Kraan continued to say: \"I would say Slot is a Guardiola-style manager based on everything I've seen over the past couple of years. The fans of Feyenoord can't believe what they've seen over that time.\"\n\nSlot was in the frame for the Tottenham job before Ange Postecoglou was eventually appointed by the north London side. The 2024-25 campaign could finally be the first time he steps foot in the English game. It will be a huge task to take the reins from Klopp, but Slot is someone who would back his ability to get a tune out of the talented squad he would be inheriting.\n\nAll statistics in this article are courtesy of Transfermarkt (Correct as of 23/04/2024)", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Football in the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Cambuur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SC Cambuur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAC_Breda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NAC Breda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johan Cruyff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/slot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

That's totally normal because the first bid you make is usually just a negotiating starting point.\n\nMy understanding is the fee would need to be in the region of \u00a39m for the deal to be closed.\n\nSources in Holland early this morning were telling me they expect this process to move very quickly because of Slot's desire to manage Liverpool.\n\nThe fact the clubs are already discussing a financial agreement is quite significant. Moving quickly is an understatement here - wow, it has been rapid.\n\nNeither Feyenoord nor Liverpool want to provide minute-by-minute coverage of what's been happening in these talks but I'm told it's been very respectful. The relationship between the clubs is very good.\n\nUltimately, the reality is that Feyenoord want to keep Slot but they understand this is such a big opportunity and they can't really stand in his way. Their goal is to get the best price possible and potentially move that figure up to the \u00a310m mark.\n\nWhether they get there, we'll see.\n\nSlot, who secured the KNVB Cup last weekend and led Feyenoord to their first title in six years last season, appeals to Liverpool due to his aggressive, full-throttle style.\n\nHe has drilled his team to be adept at turning defensive actions into shooting opportunities and they top the Eredivisie for tackles won in the opposition's final third.\n\nFeyenoord have the best defence in the league and the second-best offensive metrics.\n\nSlot has proved capable of improving individuals as well as the collective, while operating on a smaller budget than his core competitors, and his penchant for a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formation fits Liverpool's squad.\n\nSlot has previously been approached by Tottenham, Chelsea and Leeds. He signed a new contract last May to keep him at Feyenoord until 2026 but has referenced a desire to make the next step in his career.\n\nSporting manager Ruben Amorim was under consideration by Liverpool but sources say he is no longer in the frame, as it stands.\n\nWest Ham are interested in Amorim but Julen Lopetegui, the former Wolves, Real Madrid and Spain boss, and Paulo Fonseca, currently in charge of Lille, are considered the frontrunners.\n\nSlot took over from Dick Advocaat at Feyenoord for the start of the 2021/22 season with the club having finished fifth the previous campaign.\n\nJust two years later, they were champions of the Eredivisie. He built a pressing team playing intense, attack-minded football while also being able to win.\n\nFeyenoord are second behind PSV Eindhoven this season, nine points adrift with four games to play. In Europe, they finished third in their Champions League group before dropping into the Europa League, where they were knocked out by Roma on penalties in February.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan said: \"He is the prime candidate for Liverpool.\n\n\"It was only a matter of time before another big English club would come knocking on the door. He's not only been a successful manager, he's also been hugely impressive with his playing style of very attack-minded, Pep Guardiola-style football.\n\n\"I don't expect Feyenoord to stand in the way. They know he's a manager in demand but they will demand a big compensation fee. He has two years left on his contract.\n\n\"That was a record deal. Never before in Dutch football has a team paid a manager such huge wages.\n\n\"The players like him, the fans love him, the club love him - they won't want him to go. Feyenoord have every right to demand a big fee as there is no clause in his contract, which he renewed last year.\n\n\"He's been a successful coach and made Feyenoord champions playing crazy, sexy football. It is sexy what this man brings on a football pitch.\n\n\"There's nothing more to win for him here. The next step for him is to enter a club in a big league and no league is bigger for the Dutch than the Premier League.\n\n\"I will be surprised if Slot doesn't bite at this chance and become the manager of Liverpool next season.\"\n\nLast summer, Slot was one of the leading contenders for the then-vacant Tottenham manager's role and Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill went to Rotterdam to cover the story.\n\nCotterill found Slot to be \"engaging, polite, very smiley, he's got presence and charisma - and he's funny\" when writing about his trip to get the lowdown on the Feyenoord boss, who has been open about his desire to manage in the Premier League.\n\n\"My next step will not be a club in Holland,\" he said in May 2023.\n\n\"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nSpurs were determined to get Slot last summer after he secured the Eredivisie title with Feyenoord.\n\nHowever, Slot ruled himself out of the running to take over in north London before signing a new contract at Feyenoord a few days later which runs until 2026.\n\n\"I'm not done here yet,\" Slot said after the announcement of his new deal.\n\nThe potential deal with Spurs never got to any formal stage of discussions with him or Feyenoord and Spurs bosses felt that Slot used their interest in him to get an improved contract in the Netherlands.\n\nAnge Postecoglou was eventually appointed by Spurs from Celtic.\n\nEuropean football expert Andy Brassell told Sky Sports News:\n\n\"Slot is a guy who has got a consistent record of success and playing attacking football over several years. That idea of redeveloping teams and working with younger players as well is something that really appeals to Liverpool.\n\n\"The way he wants to attack would really appeal to Liverpool fans, too. He always wants his teams to find a way to put pressure on the opposition, to press, to score goals, and they do that in Europe as well.\n\n\"No one is quite like Jurgen Klopp in front of the media, but Slot is no shrinking violet at all. We've seen this when his side have played Roma and he's come up against Jose Mourinho. He's not afraid to upset and won't back down.\n\n\"Premier League clubs have known he would fit in well for quite a while. The Premier League has moved more towards possession and front-foot football, so it's probably the right time for Slot.\n\n\"Of course, there's a gap in quality compared to the Eredivisie, but he'll have better players at his disposal in the Premier League.\"", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Advocaat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Advocaat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

And Feyenoord is a really complicated club.\n\n\"He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money. He could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football.\n\n\"You can clearly see his hand where he is the coach. I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.\"\n\nSlot previously became a target for Tottenham before they chose Ange Postecoglou. He only signed a new three-year contract with Feyenoord last year and technical director Dennis te Kloese is confident he will remain in his post beyond the summer.\n\n\"I think it is logical that he is in such a good position,\" said Te Kloese via vi.nl. 'It is very special how he has manifested himself in recent years and has really given Feyenoord a face.\n\n\"We responded by extending his contract. In any case, we assume that he will also be our trainer next year. We have experienced this situation before and will take good care of our own interests.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

In his first season in charge, they were second, level on points with leaders Ajax, when the Covid-19 pandemic brought the season to a premature end.\n\nHe was sacked in December 2020 when it emerged that he had been negotiating with Feyenoord.\n\nSlot took charge of Feyenoord in the summer of 2021 and has managed 144 games at the Rotterdam club, winning 93, drawing 27 and losing 24.\n\nOf his 98 league games, he has won 69 - giving him an impressive win percentage of 70.4%.\n\nHis career win percentage from more than 200 games across all competitions is 61.8%.\n\nHe won the Eredivisie with the club in 2022-23 and triumphed in the Dutch Cup this season.\n\nIn a June 2023 interview with the Athletic, Slot said about staying with Feyenoord: \"I want to work longer on the project to see what comes from that, because you can every time leave somewhere after one or two successful seasons but, in the end, where and what are you then?\n\n\"So sometimes you also have to cherish what you have.

Liverpool have reportedly established what they will need to pay to appoint Arne Slot as their new manager.\n\nThey Merseyside giants have spent the last three months assessing their options on the back of Jurgen Klopp announcing that he will depart his role at Anfield at the end of the season.\n\nSoon after Xabi Alonso committed his future to Bayer Leverkusen, it appeared that Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim was the most likely successor to the German.\n\nHowever, in recent days, the Portuguese has dropped down the pecking order, with Feyenoord boss Slot seemingly emerging as a strong candidate.\n\nReports have indicated that Liverpool have already held discussions with the 45-year-old as they bid to find Klopp's successor before the end of the current campaign.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWhat would Liverpool have to pay?\n\nOn the back of rejecting Tottenham Hotspur's interest in the past, Slot was presented with the opportunity to extend his contract at De Kuip until 2026.\n\nNevertheless, it has been widely suggested that there was no release clause included in those terms, giving Feyenoord the leeway to set their own asking price.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the Dutch giants are prepared to give the green light to an exit for Slot for \u20ac10m (\u00a38.59m).\n\nThe report acknowledges that Slot is interested in making the switch to Anfield and Feyenoord are open to allowing their successful head coach make the move to the Premier League.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWhy could Slot be viewed as the right man to replace Klopp?\n\nSlot had impressed at AZ Alkmaar before he eventually moved to Feyenoord, but his time in Rotterdam has only exceeded expectations.\n\nA total of 94 wins and just 23 defeats have come during 146 matches in all competitions, Slot having won an Eredivisie title and KNVB-Beker trophy as well as reaching the 2021-22 Europa Conference League final.\n\nAlthough Feyenoord have been outclassed by PSV Eindhoven during the current campaign, they still have 72 points from 30 games, scoring 77 goals in the process.\n\nHis style of play is also not too dissimilar to that of Klopp's the hope seemingly being that will help with the transition from a manager who has spent eight-and-a-half years at the helm.\n\nWhile other managers have been linked with the soon-to-be vacant position, it appears that Liverpool are ready to be proactive in appointing Slot as their next boss.\n\nID:542074:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect4642:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Certainly, Liverpool will be hoping so with a deal for Arne Slot now into it's final stages with Feyenoord...\n\nBut it's done. Settled. Slot, baring any late mishap, will be named new Liverpool manager. Feyenoord's Eredivisie winning coach has already agreed terms with the Reds and also has a deal in place with his current club about the number of staff he will take with him to England.\n\nAs we say, Slot is strictly third-choice. After the much-publicised snub from Xabi Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen - and Sporting CP coach Ruben Amorim's decision to pull back over 'control' issues - Liverpool turned to Slot and were greeted with an immediate enthusiastic response. So much so that there's hope that after just days of negotiations Liverpool and Feyenoord will be able to confirm agreement by the weekend.\n\nWith Slot's contract carrying a \u20ac10m buyout clause, Liverpool are attempting to talk down that fee with their Feyenoord counterparts. Knowing Slot's eagerness to see the deal closed - and the loyalty he showed last season turning down Tottenham - there is a confidence Feyenoord will be malleable over the final compensation.\n\nIn the meantime, as Liverpool's new football CEO Michael Edwards had warned Slot in their first meeting, there is a backroom staff to fill out. Klopp's departure will coincide with his coaching staff also leaving. As mentioned in past columns, it's a strange one, but Liverpool's incoming manager will be required to complete a full rebuild. But they won't all come from Rotterdam.\n\nAs of today, Slot and the Feyenoord board have agreed that only two of his staff will join him at Liverpool: assistant coach Sipke Hulshoff and high performance manager Ruben Peeters. As a source stated: \"Slot has been informed by Liverpool management about the exodus of technical people and that has everything to do with the fact that the entire Team Klopp is resigning.\"\n\nFor their part, unlike with Liverpool, Feyenoord's board \"... will not be flexible, just like with Slot himself, because the club does not want to reorganise a complete coaching panel\". Again, on Liverpool's part, it's a strange one...\n\nBut they have their man, do Liverpool. Well, at least their third choice. And it's a gamble - for both sides. Slot isn't the Klopp of 2015. Nor is the Eredivisie the Bundesliga. The step up will be huge for the 45 year-old. Liverpool have really gone with potential. What they hope can be. This isn't Klopp, nor Rafa Benitez nor Gerard Houllier. Even comparisons with Brendan Rodgers are a stretch. That Slot, unlike Xabi and Amorim, hasn't been mentioned with the jobs at Barcelona or Bayern Munich - nor with any major club this season - does raise doubts. Indeed, just yesterday Peter Bosz was asked why he wasn't considered given his PSV are nine points clear of Feyenoord at the top of table.\n\n\"Yes, but that didn't happen,\" replied PSV's coach. \"Liverpool is of course a big club, so if it all works out, that would be great for Arne. He is more than welcome!\"\n\nThough just as much for Liverpool, it is also a gamble for Slot. It was only a year ago he turned down Tottenham, feeling he wasn't quite ready for such a move. A year on. A title won. And a first Champions League campaign experienced. Slot feels better equipped to take on a Premier League post. And to be fair, as a manager, you don't turn down Liverpool.\n\nBut what will Slot be walking into? Liverpool will end the season with more questions than answers. A first defeat in 14 years to Everton. Beaten at home by Crystal Palace - and by Atalanta to end their Europa League run. One question to be raised by this dramatic fall is: just how reliant has Klopp and Liverpool been on a fully fit and in-form Mohamed Salah?\n\nThis cannot be underestimated. If Salah does leave for the Saudi Pro League this summer, how will Liverpool respond? How will Slot respond? The pressure and expectations around succeeding Klopp is one thing. But trying to succeed without perhaps the most decisive player to wear a Reds shirt this century...? As we say, this is a career gamble for Slot.\n\n\"I am a fan of another football,\" said Slot before facing Jose Mourinho's Roma earlier this season.\n\n\"I can appreciate Mourinho, despite being a (Pep) Guardiola fan.

He signed a new contract last May to keep him at Feyenoord until 2026 but has referenced a desire to make the next step in his career.\n\nCompensation is anticipated to be in the region of \u00a39m if a deal is to be closed.\n\nSporting manager Ruben Amorim was under consideration by Liverpool but sources say he is no longer in the frame, as it stands.\n\nWest Ham are interested in Amorim but Julen Lopetegui, the former Wolves, Real Madrid and Spain boss, and Paulo Fonseca, currently in charge of Lille, are considered the frontrunners.\n\nSlot took over from Dick Advocaat at Feyenoord for the start of the 21/22 season with the club having finished fifth the previous campaign. Just two years later, they were champions of the Eredivisie. He built a pressing team playing intense, attack-minded football while also being able to win.\n\nFeyenoord are second behind PSV Eindhoven this season, nine points adrift with four games to play. In Europe they finished third in their Champions League group before dropping into the Europa League where they were knocked out by Roma on penalties in February.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan said: \"He is the prime candidate for Liverpool. It was only a matter of time before another big English club would come knocking on the door. He's not only been a successful manager, he's also been hugely impressive with his playing style of very attack-minded, Pep Guardiola-style football.\n\n\"I don't expect Feyenoord to stand in the way. They know he's a manager in demand but they will demand a big compensation fee. He has two years left on his contract that was a record deal.\n\n\"Never before in Dutch football has a team paid a manager such huge wages. The players like him, the fans love him, the club love him - they won't want him to go. Feyenoord have every right to demand a big fee as there is no clause in his contract which he renewed last year.\n\n\"He's been a successful coach and made Feyenoord champions playing crazy, sexy football. It is sexy what this man brings on a football pitch. There's nothing more to win for him here. The next step for him is to enter a club in a big league and no league is bigger for the Dutch than the Premier League. I will be surprised if Slot doesn't bite at this chance and become the manger of Liverpool next season.\"\n\nLast summer, Slot was one of the leading contenders for the then-vacant Tottenham manager's role and Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill went to Rotterdam to cover the story.\n\nCotterill found Slot to be \"engaging, polite, very smiley, he's got presence and charisma - and he's funny\" when writing about his trip to get the lowdown on the Feyenoord boss, who has been open about his desire to manage in the Premier League.\n\n\"My next step will not be a club in Holland,\" he said in May 2023.\n\n\"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nSpurs were determined to get Slot last summer after he secured the Eredivisie title with Feyenoord.\n\nHowever, Slot ruled himself out of the running to take over in north London before signing a new contract at Feyenoord a few days later which runs until 2026.\n\n\"I'm not done here yet,\" Slot said after the announcement of his new deal.\n\nThe potential deal with Spurs never got to any formal stage of discussions with him or Feyenoord and Spurs' bosses felt that Slot used their interest in him to get an improved contract in the Netherlands.\n\nAnge Postecoglou was eventually appointed by Spurs from Celtic.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Advocaat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Advocaat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The current playing squad is well set up for a high-intensity pressing game, even if it didn't show a great deal of that against Everton earlier this week.\n\nSlot has proven capable of implementing such a style successfully domestically and in Europe and the Eredivisie boss appears to be a logical fit for Liverpool as a consequence. Over the years, he has said all the right things when it comes to the biggest boxes that Liverpool needs to ensure are ticked with its new manager.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot responds to Liverpool next manager question as Feyenoord boss issues short reply\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot could bring $93m Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez upgrade to Liverpool after Jamie Carragher prediction\n\nAhead of the Europa League Conference final against AS Roma two years ago, Slot told UEFA.com: \"We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity. When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nThat could easily be a quote from Klopp or his assistant, Pep Lijnders. The latter, in fact, according to Voetbal Zone, could take over at Feyenoord if Slot ends up at Anfield.\n\nA few months later, after signing a contract extension with Feyenoord, Slot told the club's official website: \"I feel that our work is greatly appreciated within the club and among the fans, not only because of the results but above all with regard to the development of players and the attractive, infectious way of playing the fans clearly enjoy.\"\n\nGetting the most out of resources will be a key factor for Liverpool in deciding who takes Klopp's job and there is a clear synergy between the team and the fans in the Netherlands that can only be a big positive as well. Slot's style and preferred way of playing, just like Klopp's, is ideal for fostering that.\n\nWhile he is similar in many ways to Klopp, though, Slot has also made no bones about his admiration for Pep Guardiola. \"He gives me the ultimate pleasure in football,\" he said last year when speaking to the Dutch outlet Voetbal International. \"City has -- and then it is not the intention to compare us with them -- a similar way of playing how we want to do with Feyenoord: 4-3-3, building backwards, wanting to put pressure quickly.\"\n\nIt is interesting that he calls his set-up a 4-3-3 there -- the same formation that Liverpool uses -- when he has also used a 4-2-3-1 system at times. It would not be a huge transition for Liverpool to work within those confines considering that would be a natural evolution from what Klopp has implemented.\n\nIt is for that reason that Slot is the leading contender at this stage for the Liverpool job, though there is potential interest from other clubs around Europe too. Bayern Munich and Barcelona are both looking for new head coaches as well, but Slot has made it clear before that he sees himself in the Premier League at some point.\n\nDuring his coaching career to date, Slot has said exactly what Liverpool would want to hear from a potential new manager. It remains to be seen whether the deal gets done, but it is not hard to see why the Reds might have identified him as a leading candidate.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_addison@liverpool.com", "name": "Matt Addison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Tactics, playing style, trophies won for Feyenoord coach touted to replace Jurgen Klopp", "body": "Premier League history shows that there are few jobs tougher then replacing successful, transformative and much-loved managers. Paradoxically, there are also few jobs more attractive to those in the elite coaching fraternity.\n\nSucceeding Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is unquestionably one of those roles and, perhaps fittingly for a big position on Merseyside, the frontrunners have been changing and jockeying for position like competitors in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nLiverpool fans educated themselves on the tactics, traits and presumed inner workings of Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim, but now Feyenoord head coach Arne Slot is the name on everyone's lips.\n\nThe Athletic's David Ornstein reported on April 24 that Liverpool were in negotiations with Slot, who is now their \"preferred choice\".\n\nMORE: Liverpool's title race run-in and projected Premier League finish\n\nSlot is certainly not the first name to be linked with the Anfield job.\n\nXabi Alonso was the early favourite to be installed as Klopp's successor, but is firmly out of the running.\n\nAlonso led Bayer Leverkusen to a historic maiden Bundesliga title and has already confirmed that he will be staying put next year. Given Leverkusen remain in contention for a treble of Bundesliga, UEFA Europa League and DFB-Pokal, who can blame him?\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in late March, Alonso said: \"We've had a lot of speculation regarding my future. We've had a lot of games, been pretty busy, pretty focused, and I wanted to use the international break and reflect and take a decision.\n\n\"Last week I had a very good meeting with Simon [Rolfes] and Fernando [Carro] and informed them of my decision to continue as coach of Bayer Leverkusen.\n\n\"It's the right place for me to be, to develop as a coach. The fans showed great support this year. They have all the reasons to believe and dream we can have a great season. The players gave me so many reasons to keep believing in the team. My job is not over here.\"\n\nThat development further strengthened the position of potential candidates like Ruben Amorim and Roberto De Zerbi, the manager of Brighton & Hove Albion. However, the shift in focus towards Slot does feel like a potentially decisive moment in the saga.\n\nWest Ham's links to Amorim suggest the trail has run cold with the Sporting CP boss as far as Liverpool are concerned.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann was also mentioned as a potential successor to his countryman Klopp but has since committed himself to remaining with the German national team.\n\nWhile acknowledging Slot's reported enthusiasm for the Anfield post, it is worth remembering that the managerial marketplace will be a crowded one at the sharp end of European football this summer. Bayern Munich, Barcelona and potentially AC Milan will be looking for a new boss and Slot's fine work will not have gone unnoticed in those footballing capitals. Liverpool are wise to be acting swiftly.\n\nMORE: Xabi Alonso out of running to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool\n\nThe timing of the latest developments looks ideal for Slot, who further burnished his reputation last weekend by lifting the KNVB Cup with Feyenoord in the Netherlands, in addition to the Eredivisie title triumph he masterminded last season.\n\nPSV Eindhoven are on the verge of taking the title back this time around in Holland and Feyenoord are safely in a Champions League qualification spot, so it's easy to see how negotiations can progress in an atmosphere of \"total respect\".\n\nNo one wants a repeat of the situation of December 2020, when Slot was sacked by AZ having already agreed a deal with Feyenoord, who he led to the UEFA Europa Conference League final in his first season in charge.\n\nThat messy exit is not the defining memory of Slot's time in Alkmaar, however. His average of 2.11 points per game is the highest of any coach in AZ history. He might even have secured an incredible Eredivisie success. In 2019/20, AZ were behind Erik ten Hag's Ajax at the top on goal difference when the Coronavirus pandemic struck and the season was voided.\n\nSlot's work at Feyenoord, a big club with a rich history but not the most financially powerful in Dutch football, has obvious parallels with Klopp's stays at Borussia Dortmund against the all-conquering Bayern Munich and at Liverpool in opposition to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. There are stylistic similarities too.\n\nSlot is an advocate of high-intensity attacking football. His team play with a high defensive line and look to get the ball forward quickly.\n\nThat obviously chimes with the most romantic remembrances of Klopp's \"heavy metal football\" at Dortmund and Liverpool, with the caveat that the Reds' boss tempered that approach when the necessity of gargantuan points totals to compete with City became apparent.\n\nSlot uses 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 setups predominantly. In the latter, it is not uncommon to see his two deeper midfielders operating close to the central defenders during the build-up to bounce passes around the opposition press.\n\nThis is an approach used in the Premier League by De Zerbi, another coach reportedly on Liverpool's radar. It also frees up full-backs to support the attack and might be music to the ears of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson and breakout star Conor Bradley.\n\nOut of possession, the Klopp staple of a high-press is fundamental for Slot. Plenty about his previous work and the characteristics of the Liverpool squad mark him out as a good fit. It will then be on Slot to prove he is not simply \"Klopp-lite\" or any other potentially unflattering labels.\n\nMORE: The best, and tightest, Premier League title races in history\n\nIf negotiations are successful with Slot, Liverpool are going to have to put their hands in their pockets.\n\nThe 45-year-old is contracted to Feyenoord until 2026. Slot confirmed himself upon signing that new deal that there is no release clause in his contract, and a compensation package would likely be somewhere in the region of \u20ac10 million (\u00a38.5m/$10.7m).\n\nWhen Slot was a target for Tottenham last summer, multiple reports suggested Feyenoord improved his annual salary from \u20ac2m to \u20ac2.9m.\n\nMORE: How do Liverpool replace a manager like Klopp?\n\nIf Slot is the man to take over at Anfield, Liverpool fans will have to get used to singing his name on the Kop, just as they have done with Klopp.\n\nReports of Slot being the preferred candidate to take over at Liverpool were also met with a flurry of questions on social media about how to pronounce his name? Well, as with many Dutch names, it's not too complicated for English speakers. His name is pronounced phonetically as it is spelt, \"Ar-ner\" \"Slot\".\n\nTo begin perfecting your pronunciation, Liverpool fans, you can hear it pronounced by a Dutch native here.\n\nSlot would certainly be expected to hit the ground running if he does take over at Liverpool, but he will have an advantage in getting his message across to the talent-packed squad quickly, as he already speaks great English.\n\nSlot has been questioned in press conferences previously by English journalists as part of Feyenoord's European club commitments, including last year when he was linked with Tottenham and promptly showed off his language skills.\n\nKlopp's decision to step down from his role at Anfield caught everyone by surprise.\n\nHe made the announcement in an emotional video and written message on the club's website in January, citing that he was \"running out of energy\" for the demands of managing at the top level.\n\nThe news has hit Liverpool fans hard, but it has also sent reverberations around the Premier League.\n\nKlopp's rivalry with Manchester City boss Guardiola has proved to be the defining battle of its time in English football.\n\nIn 2018, Liverpool dumped City out of the Champions League en route to a final defeat against Real Madrid in Kyiv.\n\nThey also lost to Los Blancos in the 2022 final, but Klopp made sure of Liverpool's sixth European crown when they defeated Tottenham 2-0 at Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in 2019.\n\nThat success facilitated glory in the 2019 editions of the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Liverpool also won the domestic knockout double of the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in 2020/21.\n\nLiverpool picked up another trophy as they overcame Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final in February and Klopp has this season pieced together a youthful exciting team featuring the likes of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones, Darwin Nunez and a rejuvenated Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nThey remain firmly in the hunt for the Premier League title in a three-way battle with City and leaders Arsenal, despite a damaging 1-0 home loss to Crystal Palace.\n\nHaving joined the club in October 2015, Klopp offered a clear explanation for his pending departure when speaking to Liverpool's in-house media team on January 26.\n\n\"I will leave the club at the end of the season. I can understand that it's a shock for a lot of people in this moment when you read it for the first time,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously I can explain it or at least try to explain it. I love absolutely everything about this club, I love everything about this city, I love everything about our supporters, I love the team, I love the staff. I love everything.\n\n\"That I still take this decision probably shows you that I'm convinced it's the one I have to take. It is that I'm...how can I say... I'm running out of energy.\n\n\"I have no problem now. I think I know it already for longer that I will have to announce it at one point. But I'm absolutely fine now, but I also know that I cannot do the job again and again and again and again.\n\n\"After all the years we had together and all the time we spent together, all the things we went through together, the respect grew for you and the love grew for you. The least I owe you is the truth. And that's the truth.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type":

Yet, there was a twist in the tale, as the 45-year-old opted to stay at Feyenoord and sign a new contract.\n\nDespite his success in the Netherlands, Liverpool fans might hold concerns over what he can bring and if he can fill the very large boots left by Klopp. They will also take one look at their biggest rivals Manchester United, and see how Erik ten Hag is currently struggling at Old Trafford after impressing at Ajax.\n\nBut Slot is a cutting-edge operator with an exciting brand of football, and could prove to be a shrewd appointment if the Reds make a successful move for him.\n\nArne Slot has emerged as a strong contender to take over the Liverpool job from Jurgen Klopp\n\nSlot has impressed many with his work in Rotterdam, winning the Eredivisie title last season\n\nFilling Klopp's boots at Anfield is a massive challenge, but Slot could be a shrewd appointment\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nHis approach to management is defined by energy, a high-octane pressing style that Klopp himself with his 'heavy-metal' brand of football would give his nod of approval to.\n\nDutch football experts have also likened him to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola - with Slot said to be a massive fan of the Spaniard.\n\nOne Dutch journalist told Sky Sports last year before his failed move to Tottenham: 'He's a really good manager. I've followed Feyenoord for 40 years. Not since the days of Johan Cruyff at Ajax in the 1980s has there been a coach so attack-minded in the Dutch league. Cruyff only had a few disciples who followed him and one of them was Pep Guardiola.\n\n'I would say Slot is a Guardiola-style manager based on everything I've seen over the past couple of years. The fans of Feyenoord can't believe what they've seen over that time.'\n\nSlot prefers to deploy either a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 system that relies on possession which would fit Liverpool's current squad. He has a focus on regaining the ball as quickly as possible and his side top the Eredivisie for tackles won in the opposition's final third.\n\nHe likes his teams to play with two holding midfielders, while the attacking impetus is placed on wide players to deliver chances for the central striker.\n\nExplaining his approach with Feyenoord, Slot told UEFA: 'We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity.\n\n'When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.'\n\nSlot has been described as a 'Pep Guardiola-style manager' thanks to his work at Feyenoord\n\nOne person claimed he plays the most attacking style of football seen in the Netherlands since Johan Cruyff was a manager\n\nSlot prefers to deploy a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 system at Feyenoord with two defensive midfielders and a reliance on wingers to create opportunities for a central striker\n\nA source told Mail Sport last year that Slot 'runs the whole club at Feyenoord' so it might be expected that he would like to have a big say behind the scenes at Liverpool\n\nThe Dutchman also has a reputation of developing youth players, something which will be integral for the Reds going forward, given the amount of youngsters coming through, including Conor Bradley and Jarell Quansah who have impressed since making the step-up to the first time.\n\n'Players like him. He understands people, that's his biggest strength,' a source told Mail Sport last year.\n\nThough he has a charismatic charm and is well liked by players, he was also described as someone who 'isn't necessarily easy'.\n\nAnother source said: 'He is a very friendly and likeable guy, he uses that. Arne's a top coach, but he isn't necessarily easy,' said a source. 'He runs the whole club at Feyenoord, he has all the power.'\n\nSlot previously impressed at AZ Alkmaar, but was abruptly sacked in December 2020 after owner Robert Eenhoorn was informed that the manager attended a clandestine meeting with Feyenoord about replacing then manager, Dick Advocaat.\n\nThough he can be a challenging figure at Feyenoord, his success at the club is not questionable.\n\nThe Eredivisie side have a rich history with players like Ruud Gullit, Ronald Koeman, Robin van Persie and Henrik Larsson all previously playing for the club. They won the European Cup in 1970, the UEFA Cup twice and the Dutch title 16 times.\n\nThey had won the league just once this century before Slot led them to the title last season.\n\nIt even came after they had to deal with losing some of their big players, with the likes of Tyrell Malacia, Luis Sinisterra, Marcos Senesi and Fredrik Aursnes leaving for a combined \u00a360m after they lost in the final of the Europa Conference League to Roma two years ago.\n\nSlot could link up with Dutch compatriots Cody Gakpo, Virgil van Dijk and Ryan Gravenberch at Anfield\n\nBut they continue to buy players wisely, with Mexican forward Santiago Gimenez scoring 47 goals in 85 appearances since he arrived at the club for just \u00a33m in the summer of 2022.\n\nPSV Eindhoven are on the verge of reclaiming the Dutch title this season, but a second place finish for Slot's Feyenoord along with success in the Dutch Cup this month reflects another strong season.\n\nHis Feyenoord side have proven themselves to be efficient in both attack and defence, scoring 77 goals in 30 games while only conceding 23.\n\nDutch legend Marco van Basten is convinced that Slot can become a success at Liverpool if the Reds made a move.\n\n'I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it is an enrichment for Dutch football. He can really go anywhere - Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that,' Van Basten said of Slot on Ziggo Sport's Rondo.\n\n'I've spoken to him a few times and I think what he does and what he sees is very strong. He gets along very well with the group of players, is tactically well-versed, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent. I think he can go to any club, even at the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent.\n\nSlot has two major pieces of silverware during his time at Feyenoord, in a league that has so often been dominated by Ajax and PSV Eindhoven during the 21st century\n\nMarco van Basten believes it would be easier for Slot to succeed at Liverpool with better players and believes he has the quality to become the manager at Anfield\n\n'He has a lot of qualities and he shows it at every level. He first did it at AZ, and now at Feyenoord. And Feyenoord is a really complicated club. He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money.\n\n'He could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football. You can clearly see his hand where he is the coach.\n\n'I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.'\n\nHis work has not gone unnoticed with Tottenham and Chelsea previously considering moves for him last year, while the likes of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AC Milan will all have Slot in their thinking as they look for new managers.\n\nSlot himself has also stated that he hoped his next move would be the Premier League.\n\nHe said: 'My next step will not be a club in Holland.\n\n'If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

Slot is seen by Liverpool as their ideal next manager after Klopp's successful tenure. There will likely need to be millions spent for Feyenoord to accept Liverpool's offer, and so delays in negotiations for Slot's arrival have become increasingly likely.\n\nLiverpool seem to be ramping onwards with their bid to bring a new boss to the helm in current Feyenoord gaffer Arne Slot - but according to local reports from the Netherlands, the Reds are set to see their first offer rejected.\n\nSlot has been earmarked as the man to replace Jurgen Klopp, with the German announcing his departure from Anfield at the end of the season in a move that will end a nine-year spell at Anfield, having won eight trophies in that time and firmly putting Liverpool back on the map again after around a decade of mediocrity.\n\nSlot could come in to keep the good times rolling at Anfield, and it's thought that Liverpool chiefs are in agreement that they see him as their next best manager, with 1908.nl suggesting that they have flown out to Rotterdam in a bid to thrash out a deal for Slot. But any hopes of a quick agreement have been dashed after being knocked back with their first offer.\n\nArne Slot: Liverpool Appointment Latest This is a move that could take some time to get right\n\nThe report states that Liverpool officials touched down in Rotterdam on Wednesday morning with an opening bid to prise the manager away from Feyenoord's hands, with the news being no great surprise to many after preliminary talks were opened with Slot to gauge his interest in a move.\n\nThe deal is expected to cost millions, and with Slot having won the Eredivisie with Feyenoord last season, he would likely take assistant Sipke Hulshoff with him alongside other members of his backroom staff - which would leave Feyenoord with more staff to replace.\n\nHowever, there has been a spanner in the works, with the report suggesting that their first offer will be rejected, despite further bids being expected to follow.\n\nAgent Rafaela Pimenta is said to be busy with contract details, with Slot looking more and more likely to leave for Liverpool in the coming weeks after an outstanding three years at Feyenoord. Overseeing a top-flight title, the Dutch Cup, a runner-up spot in the Europa Conference League and the development of stars such as Luis Sinisterra - now at Bournemouth - and Santiago Gimenez, who is one of the finest young talents the Eredivisie currently boasts with 21 goals in 29 games this season, it could be the tonic that Liverpool need.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Sinisterra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Sinisterra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mixcollage-12-feb-2024-03-15-pm-6030.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

But, with the Sporting CP head coach reportedly entertaining talks with West Ham and keeping his options open, Liverpool are running out of time to appoint a suitable successor.\n\nSo, Van Basten has pointed the Reds in the direction of Slot. After leading Feyenoord to their first Eredivisie title in six years last season, the 45-year-old was heavily linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur but he signed a new three-year deal at De Kuip instead.\n\nREAD MORE: Jose Mourinho sent clear Liverpool message as Virgil van Dijk anticipates move\n\nREAD MORE: Jamie Carragher names new 'favourite' for Liverpool job after Ruben Amorim update\n\nAs a result, the Lilywhites appointed Ange Postecoglou instead.

Nevertheless, Van Basten has backed his fellow countryman to prosper at either Liverpool or Bayern Munich.\n\n\"I think he's really good,\" said the legendary former striker on Ziggo Sport's 'Rondo', as quoted by the Metro. \"I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it is an enrichment for Dutch football.\n\n\"He can really go anywhere - Bayern Munich, Liverpool...

He gets along very well with the group of players, is tactically well-versed, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent.\n\n\"I think he can go to any club, even at the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent. He has a lot of qualities and he shows it at every level. He first did it at AZ, and now at Feyenoord. And Feyenoord is a really complicated club.\n\n\"He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money. He could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football.\n\n\"You can clearly see his hand where he is the coach. I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.\"\n\nSinging from the same hymn sheet, Wim Jonk also backed Slot to impress at Liverpool. The former Netherlands international said: \"He gave Feyenoord a face. Arne has made enormous strides, so I would like that. Liverpool is also a bit like the Feyenoord of England.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_stokes@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Jake Stokes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_Nijmegen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NEC Nijmegen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Kuip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Kuip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Jonk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wim Jonk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

The Reds have been on the lookout for a successor to Jurgen Klopp since the German announced he was departing the club in January. Klopp is set to leave Merseyside at the end of the current campaign.\n\nThe Premier League side has been linked with a series of coaches in recent months. This list included Xabi Alonso, Roberto De Zerbi, and Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, Slot is now emerging as a frontrunner for the position. David Ornstein is reporting that Liverpool has already offered a compensation package of about $9.6 million to Feyenoord.\n\nThe Dutch team, however, has rejected this initial offer. Slot does not currently have a release clause with his current club, which means that the two sides must agree to a fee for the coach. Slot is believed to be highly interested in a switch to the Reds this summer though. The Dutchman previously rejected a chance to move to the Premier League last year after Tottenham Hotspur attempted to sign him before switching their attention to Ange Postecoglou.\n\nLiverpool's interest in Slot seemingly makes sense for a few different reasons. First of all, the coach has been successful with Feyenoord. The Dutchman led the club to the Eredivisie title for the 2022/23 season, only their second championship since 2000. The team also just picked up the KNVB Cup on Sunday as well.\n\nNot only has Slot collected trophies at Feyenoord, but his team plays fairly similar to Klopp's Liverpool. Much like the Reds, Slot's Dutch side is an offensive powerhouse that also presses opponents high up the pitch. Feyenoord has averaged 2.57 goals per game this season, which is slightly higher than Liverpool's 2.27. Both clubs also rank inside the top 15 teams among the best 10 European leagues in high turnovers and possession won in the final third of the pitch.\n\nFeyenoord ranks second in the Eredivisie in total shots, while also allowing the fewest shots in the league as well. These figures are very similar to Liverpool under Klopp during the current campaign.\n\nOutside of statistics, Slot also has a reputation for developing young players while at his current club. Due to various injuries to key players, Klopp has had to regularly rely on youthful talent this season. Conor Bradley, Jarell Quansah, and Bobby Clark have all made a series of Premier League starts for Klopp throughout the campaign. Not only have they made unexpected appearances in big games, but the youngsters have also performed well for the club.\n\nThe combination of coaching style and handling of young players would seemingly make for an easy transition for Slot at Liverpool. A deal to bring the Dutchman to Anfield, however, is not yet finalized. The English side still needs to agree to an appropriate compensation package for Feyenoord to sign its target.\n\nOther big English clubs such as Manchester United and Arsenal have struggled in recent years after replacing legendary managers. Liverpool would certainly benefit from targeting a similar coach as Klopp to help ease the pressure on their new manager.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange_Postecoglou", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ange Postecoglou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarell_Quansah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarell Quansah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999\u20132000_La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1999\u20132000 La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bradley_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bradley (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240424_WST_503159_Arne-Slot-Liverpool.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Liverpool are reportedly set to 'move fast' to get a deal for the 45-year-old over the line.\n\nNews of Slot's ascension to FSG's first choice may have come as a surprise to many, some of whom may never even have heard of the Dutchman. However, there are said to be plenty of things that Liverpool really like about Slot.\n\nLike any appointment, there are some worries attached, though. And journalist Mark Ogden has shared what the Reds are 'fearing' as they look to make Slot their new manager.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly how Liverpool fans greet the potential appointment of Slot. So far, the reaction online has largely been something like bemused cautious optimism.\n\nStill, nothing is done quite yet. Although there have been claims in the Netherlands that Slot is already looking for houses on Merseyside, he isn't Liverpool manager just yet.\n\nAnd according to Ogden, there's still a 'fear' from the Reds that the Feyenoord boss may go elsewhere. Speaking to BBC 5 Live's The Tuesday Night Club last night, the journalist said that Bayern Munich and Barcelona might still derail their attempts to get Slot.\n\n\"He is a leading target, and Liverpool feel that he does match their criteria in terms of style of play, his personality and ability to work within the system,\" Ogden reports.\n\n\"Now, people at Liverpool fear that they might have competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona but he is a serious candidate which I'm a little bit surprised at.\n\n\"They have been looking at Xabi Alonso but he ruled himself out quite quickly and Ruben Amorim, I'm not saying priced himself out of the market, but Liverpool do seem to be looking elsewhere.\"\n\nAs well as a worry that Slot may go elsewhere, there may also be some trepidation from Liverpool supporters that the step up is too big for him. The Reds themselves don't seem to have this worry, or they wouldn't target him in the first place.\n\nBut, continuing his update last night, Ogden questioned whether the former AZ Alkmaar coach was quite the right man for Liverpool.\n\n\"Arne Slot turned down Tottenham last summer, so that was a surprise that turned down a very good Premier League job to stay with Feyenoord,\" he says.\n\n\"So, Liverpool with due respect to Tottenham, is a much bigger club and a much bigger challenge to replace Jurgen Klopp, so you need a big personality to take that job and big credentials and whether Arne Slot is ready, I don't know.\n\nIn our opinion, for Liverpool to go public with the Slot news, they must be confident of beating Bayern and Barca to him.

He has two years left on his contract that was a record deal.\n\n\"Never before in Dutch football has a team paid a manager such huge wages. The players like him, the fans love him, the club love him - they won't want him to go. Feyenoord have every right to demand a big fee as there is no clause in his contract which he renewed last year.\n\n\"He's been a successful coach and made Feyenoord champions playing crazy, sexy football. It is sexy what this man brings on a football pitch. There's nothing more to win for him here. The next step for him is to enter a club in a big league and no league is bigger for the Dutch than the Premier League. I will be surprised if Slot doesn't bite at this chance and become the manger of Liverpool next season.\"\n\nWhat has Slot said about managing in Premier League?\n\nLast summer, Slot was one of the leading contenders for the then-vacant Tottenham manager's role and Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill went to Rotterdam to cover the story.\n\nCotterill found Slot to be \"engaging, polite, very smiley, he's got presence and charisma - and he's funny\" when writing about his trip to get the lowdown on the Feyenoord boss, who has been open about his desire to manage in the Premier League.\n\n\"My next step will not be a club in Holland,\" he said in May 2023.\n\n\"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nWhat happened with Tottenham's approach for Slot?\n\nSpurs were determined to get Slot last summer after he secured the Eredivisie title with Feyenoord.\n\nHowever, Slot ruled himself out of the running to take over in north London before signing a new contract at Feyenoord a few days later which runs until 2026.\n\n\"I'm not done here yet,\" Slot said after the announcement of his new deal.\n\nTottenham chairman Daniel Levy was keen on securing Arnie Slot last summer\n\nThe potential deal with Spurs never got to any formal stage of discussions with him or Feyenoord and Spurs' bosses felt that Slot used their interest in him to get an improved contract in the Netherlands.\n\nAnge Postecoglou was eventually appointed by Spurs from Celtic.\n\nAd content | Stream Sky Sports on NOW\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

Meanwhile, The Times has mentioned a fee of around \u00a38.6million.\n\nThis would make him a cheaper option than Amorim, whose release clause is said to be \u00a312.8million.\n\nWhat can Liverpool fans expect from Arne Slot?\n\nSlot joined Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing at AZ, and continued to go from strength to strength in Rotterdam. The 45-year-old won the Eredivisie title last year and has won the Dutch Cup this season.\n\nHowever, Slot's silverware-winning efforts only tell half the story. He certainly ticks the boxes in terms of what he can bring to Liverpool tactics-wise.\n\nReddy wrote on Sky Sports that Slot 'has drilled his team to be adept at turning defensive actions into shooting opportunities and they top the Eredivisie for tackles won in the opposition's final third.\n\n'Feyenoord have the best defence in the league and the second-best offensive metrics.\n\n'Slot has proved capable of improving individuals as well as the collective, while operating on a smaller budget than his core competitors, and his penchant for a 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-3 formation fits Liverpool's squad.'\n\nFeyenoord's Alireza Jahanbakhsh, formerly of Brighton & Hove Albion, has sung the 45-year-old's praises on a couple of occasions.\n\n\"During my time at AZ, as assistant coach, Arne Slot, was one of the people who helped me to become a better player,\" he said in 2021 following his move to Feyenoord, as reported by The Argus.\n\n\"So when he called and asked if I wanted to come to Feyenoord, I told him I was going to do everything I could to make this transfer. I had no doubts.\"\n\nIn a further interview, the Iran international labelled Slot as \"the best\" in the Netherlands and one of the best managers he's ever worked with.\n\n\"He is one of the best managers I've ever seen,\" he said, as per The Athletic. \"In football terms, even the best. At the moment, he is the best in the Netherlands.\"", "source": {"uri": "tbrfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boot Room"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giuseppe_labellarte@tbrfootball.com", "name": "Giuseppe Labellarte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alireza_Jahanbakhsh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Argus_(Brighton)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Argus (Brighton)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn1.tbrfootball.com/uploads/27/2024/04/GettyImages-2149540680-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 2083, "textEnd": 2090}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

As we've reported, Liverpool's initial offer of around \u20ac9m was rejected. We understand that Feyenoord have been holding out for a figure much closer to \u20ac15m. Slot still has two years left on his contract, no release clause, and of course, they don't want to lose him. What we do know is that Slot is very enthusiastic about taking over from Klopp, it's a challenge that we wants to take on.\n\nSky Sports reporter Melissa Reddy has confirmed that a deal to appoint Slot is now moving quickly, with the 45-year-old keen to make a move happen. It's no surprise that the Feyenoord boss is keen on joining the Premier League outfit, with the Dutch coach only managing in his home country so far in his career.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pearce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Pearce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Pearce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Pearce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger_Management", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/liverpool-manager-target-arne-slot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The 'charismatic rap aficionado' now favourite to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool", "body": "Meet Arne Slot, the Feyenoord boss who is being tipped to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool.\n\nBack in January, the world of football was shaken to its core when Liverpool boss Klopp announced his decision to leave the club at the end of the 23/24 season.\n\nThe likes of Xabi Alonso, Ruben Amorim, Roberto De Zerbi and Thomas Tuchel have since been linked with a move to Anfield.\n\nHowever, Alonso revealed last month that he will be staying at Bayer Leverkusen, whilst recent reports indicate that Amrorim moving to Liverpool is unlikely.\n\nMeanwhile, the odds on Slot replacing Klopp have been dropping by the day. So who exactly is the highly-rated Dutchman?\n\nDuring his playing days, the 45-year old played for the likes of FC Zwolle, NAC Breda, Sparta Rotterdam and PEC Zwolle.\n\nAfter retiring in 2013, Slot became a youth team coach at PEC Zwolle before moving to SC Cambuur as an assistant coach.\n\nSlot eventually became the head coach at AZ Alkmaar before COVID-19 hampered his first season in charge.\n\nIn 2020, Slot was sacked after negotiating a deal to take over at Feyernoord.\n\nUnder Slot, Feyenoord finished third in the Eredivisie during his first season in charge, he also took them to the final of the Europa Conference League, in which the Rotterdam club lost to Jose Mourinho's AS Roma.\n\nLast season, he led the club to their first league title since 2017.\n\nSlot has been praised for his presence and charisma, as well as his exciting style of football.\n\nThe former midfielder has also been compared to Pep Guardiola, according to Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan, who said: \"He's a really good manager and sometimes it can come fast and quick. I've followed Feyenoord for 40 years. Not since the days of Johan Cruyff at Ajax in the 1980s has there been a coach so attack-minded in the Dutch league. Cruyff only had a few disciples who followed him and one of them was Pep Guardiola.\n\n\"I would say Slot is a Guardiola-style manager based on everything I've seen over the past couple of years.

But Dutchman Slot, 45, is also of interest to Bayern Munich, along with Ralf Rangnick and Roberto de Zerbi, as the German champions look to land Thomas Tuchel's successor.\n\nLiverpool are now making their move though and talks are set to proceed on what settlement package the Eredivisie club will want for their manager, who has a contract with just under two years to run. It's understood that figure will be around \u00a38.6m but talks will take place.\n\nThe fact Liverpool are now opening talks with Feyenoord suggests they've heard the right noises from Slot that he wants to move to Anfield. They've pinpointed the Dutchman as their perfect candidate to replace Klopp due to his ability to improve players and his aggressive, high-octane playing style.\n\nThe Reds had been linked with Bayer Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso but never really believed he would leave the new Bundesliga champions and last month he confirmed he is staying in Germany. Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim - another strongly linked with Liverpool - has held discussions with West Ham but is reportedly not currently keen on a move to the London Stadium.\n\nBrighton boss De Zerbi is another on Liverpool's list but Slot is now the most likely. The Dutch manager led Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title last season and won the Dutch cup this term by beating NEC on Sunday.\n\nThey are currently nine points off leaders PSV in this season's title battle with just four games to go so will be relinquishing their Eredivisie crown. They finished third in their Champions League group this season and exited the Europa League after defeat by Roma in February.\n\nArne Slot is the frontrunner to take over at Liverpool\n\nWill Arne Slot be a good appointment for Liverpool? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\nLiverpool executive Michael Edwards and sporting director Richard Hughes continue to lead the search for Klopp's successor alongside data analyst Will Spearman. Slot was on Tottenham's shortlist last summer before he opted to stay in Holland and Spurs went for Ange Postecoglou.\n\nHe has been backed by Dutch legend Marco van Basten to be a success outside of his homeland. Van Basten said: \"I think Slot is really good. I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer, because it is an enrichment for Dutch football.\n\n\"He can really go anywhere: Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that. I hope he stays in the Netherlands, but I am convinced he can do it anywhere. I've spoken to him a few times, and he handles the players very well. Of course, he is also very well versed tactically.\n\n\"I can explain his ideas well; he is calm and intelligent. As far as I am concerned, he is a top trainer.

The Feyenoord chief is understood to be open to heading to Anfield despite gaining additional interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Respected journalist Dean Jones believes Liverpool are attempting to prove to Sporting head coach Ruben Amorim that he is not the only contender for the job.\n\nLiverpool have admitted that Arne Slot is a 'contender' to succeed Jurgen Klopp in the Anfield dugout, and journalist Dean Jones has told GIVEMESPORT that the Merseyside giants may have been open in their pursuit of the Feyenoord head coach in a bid to hurry Sporting chief Ruben Amorim into making a decision over his future.\n\nThe Reds have been frustrated in their attempts to identify the ideal candidate to be installed as their next manager as Xabi Alonso confirmed that he will be remaining with the newly-crowed Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen instead of embarking on a fresh challenge with one of his former employers.\n\nFenway Sports Group's chief executive of football Michael Edwards and incoming sporting director Richard Hughes have been leading the search since being handed crucial behind the scenes roles, and time is ticking before Klopp walks away from the Premier League title-chasers next month.\n\nSlot Earmarked as Leading Contender to Secure Reds Role\n\nSlot has emerged as the clear frontrunner to move into the Liverpool hot-seat during the summer as Edwards and Hughes have pinpointed him as the first-choice option to replace Klopp, according to the Telegraph, and the interest will intensify over the course of the coming days even though Feyenoord are desperate to retain his services.\n\nThe report suggests that the Dutch tactician, who has led his current employers to 93 wins from 144 matches at the helm, is enthusiastic about the prospect of building on the success enjoyed under Klopp despite also gaining interest from La Liga heavyweights Barcelona and Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.\n\nArne Slot's managerial record in the Eredivisie this season compared to Jurgen Klopp in the Premier League\n\nArne Slot\n\nJurgen

of 23/04/2024\n\nIt is understood that Liverpool have contacted Slot in a bid to discover whether he is willing to head to the Premier League for the first time in his managerial career, while there is confidence that he is capable of being a success in new surroundings thanks to his style of play and philosophy.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Arne Slot has not finished lower than sixth over the course of a league campaign during his senior managerial career, while he has won the title on one occasion with Feyenoord\n\nDean Jones - Slot Pursuit Shows Amorim is Not in Control of Situation\n\nHaving told GIVEMESPORT that Slot came to light as a candidate for the Liverpool job over the course of the weekend, Jones has been informed by figures within the Premier League high-flyers that the 45-year-old is firmly on their radar and their interest is increasing as they continue assessing their options.\n\nBut the respected journalist has refused to rule out the possibility of the Reds attempting to put pressure on Sporting head coach Amorim, who has been described as 'outstanding' by Portugal-based reporter Tom Kundert, by emphasising that they will not wait for a final decision and publicly conceding that they are chasing Feyenoord's boss.\n\nJones told GIVEMESPORT:\n\n\"We reported on Tuesday how Arne Slot had emerged as a name in Liverpool's view and was becoming more serious, and that has accelerated to the point of briefings from the club that he is a contender for the job.\n\n\"It is pretty rare to get such a clear indicator of a manager being considered, so I am also slightly sceptical of the reasons behind any such leak of information.\n\n\"The latest reports also point out that other candidates are being considered and, at a time when Ruben Amorim is not yet discarded as an option, the cynic in me wonders if this is a little message to let him know that he cannot dictate how this managerial situation plays out.\"\n\nFenway Sports Group Learn Slot Compensation Package\n\nFeyenoord are seeking a \u00a38.59million compensation package for Slot, according to MailOnline, and the KNVB Cup winners will not entertain the possibility of Slot leaving their dugout unless Liverpool are willing to meet their demands ahead of the 2024/25 campaign getting underway.\n\nThe report suggests that the Dutch giants are willing to allow the former AZ Alkmaar chief to move on, despite him leading the Rotterdam-based outfit to the Eredivisie title last season, as they have become increasingly frustrated with his agent Rafaela Pimenta regularly offering him to other clubs.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Transfermarkt\n\nRelated How Liverpool Could Raise Over \u00a3170m This Summer Without Selling Mo Salah It looks to be a big summer

Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim have both been linked, and the latest name is Feyenoord manager Slot.\n\nThe 45-year-old has now emerged as a top choice for the Reds to replace Klopp this summer - and he's only added further fuel to the fire by cancelling a press conference in his home country. And off the back of the interest from Liverpool, Daily Star Sport takes a look at the Dutchman's pedigree.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot's Feyenoord press conference cancelled as link to Liverpool emerges\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot could become next Liverpool manager with club having scoured Europe\n\nSlot had a middle of the road playing career in his native Netherlands that saw him represent a number of mid-table Eredivise sides. And after hanging up his boots in 2013, Slot embarked into career in management.\n\nAfter numerous roles as a youth coach and an assistant, Slot received his first top job with AZ Alkmaar in 2019. He would last just one season in Alkmaar before moving to Eredivise giants Feyenoord in the summer of 2020.\n\nWhat do you think of Arne Slot being linked with the Liverpool job? Let us know in the comments section\n\nSlot has been a revelation in Rotterdam, restoring the once faltering side to their former glory. He took them to the Europa Conference League final in 2021/22 season, missing out on gold to Jose Mourinho's Roma.\n\nHowever, the good times would soon start to roll - first there was the Eredivise title last season, and he then the claimed the KNVB Cup earlier this year. Slot's brand of football relies on wingers, much like Klopp, and he likes his side to press.\n\nSpeaking to UEFA, Slot explained about his style at Feyenoord: \"We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity.\n\n\"When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nSlot has also drawn comparisons to Marcelo Bielsa, the former Leeds United manager who ended their Premier League exile in 2020, thanks to tactics of pushing his full-backs high up the pitch and commanding his centre-backs to move wider.\n\nHowever, unlike Bielsa, and more like Klopp, Slot is seen as a player-manager rather than a tactician. \"He puts his arm around them,\" Dennis van Eersel, of Dutch national TV channel RTV said, \"they like him because he's built a harmony at the club!\"\n\nSlot doesn't have a release clause in his current Feyenoord deal, which expires in 2026, but, according to The Times a fee of less than \u20ac10million euros (\u00a38.6million) could be enough to pry him away from the Netherlands. In comparison, Amorim's release clause is valued at nearer \u00a313m.\n\nLiverpool are back in action on Wednesday evening, as they make the short trip to Goodison Park for the Merseyside Derby.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_schofield@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Will Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

He is the first choice of Fenway Sports Group chief Michael Edwards and incoming director of football Richard Hughes.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Feyenoord's match against Go Ahead Eagles on Thursday night, the 45-year-old told ESPN: \"I'd like to become new Liverpool manager, my decisions is clear. Feyenoord and Liverpool are in talks to negotiate, I'm waiting to see what will come out of it.

The Dutch club are consigned to losing their manager and have identified FC Twente boss Joseph Oosting as a target to replace him.\n\nSlot had earlier chosen to avoid answering questions about his links to Liverpool when he was approached by a reporter when getting off the team bus in Deventer. But, having failed to reach an agreement with Tottenham last summer, he appears destined for the Premier League.\n\nThat has always been the plan for the ambitious coach, who admitted last year: \"The next step will not be another club in Holland.

The Guardiola disciple who coaches like Mikel Arteta", "body": "Arne Slot is the disciple of Pep Guardiola who has strong similarities to Mikel Arteta and Roberto De Zerbi in the way he coaches and the intense playing style he demands.\n\nSlot's Feyenoord side play some of the most exciting, entertaining, high-energy, attacking football on the Continent. It should come as little surprise then that Liverpool are interested in hiring him as J\u00fcrgen Klopp's successor - with Slot a friend of Klopp's assistant Pep Lijnders, who is also leaving Anfield.\n\nThe 45-year-old former midfielder is renowned for his precise coaching methods and his attention to detail. So precise is he that that the 'rondo' - the training drill whereby players attempt to keep the ball while a smaller group aim to intercept - is made extremely specific at Feyenoord.\n\nSlot is concerned the drill does not allow players to 'scan' (to check the options on the pitch) which is one of the fundamentals of passing and so he insists that they can take only one touch, that they cannot return possession to the player who passed to them and, crucially, that the ball always stays below the knee. Players are even encouraged to consider which foot they are passing with.\n\nTelegraph Sport learnt this, as Slot led Feyenoord last year to only their second Dutch league title this century, after being given detailed access into the way he works and his methodology - and ambition.\n\nThis campaign Feyenoord have won the Dutch Cup and are second to PSV Eindhoven in the league - although it should be factored in that he is operating with a fraction of his rivals' finances and also those of Ajax, who are 24 points behind.\n\nFeyenoord may traditionally be the third biggest club in the Netherlands but that gives a false impression. They are far behind the Dutch giants in terms of budget and had been, in recent years, frankly one of its most boring, defensive teams especially under Slot's predecessor Dick Advocaat. How that has changed.\n\nLiverpool are not the first Premier League club to take an interest in Slot who joined Feyenoord from AZ Alkmaar in 2021. But Liverpool are clearly the biggest and most serious proposition. Leeds United tried to hire him in February 2023 after sacking Jesse Marsch (and he would be a natural successor to Marcelo Bielsa) but Slot stayed in Rotterdam.\n\nTottenham Hotspur then made a move before they eventually brought in Ange Postecoglou - with Slot surprisingly deciding to stay at Feyenoord and signing a new contract.\n\nGiven that Feyenoord's style of play is so demanding, it is impressive they suffer so few injuries - in contrast to Leeds under Bielsa, which is why Feyenoord were so interested in Slot.\n\nThe demanding attention to detail is a theme. For example, Slot has concluded that in training sessions for the days immediately after games the players should work in a space no longer than 40 metres. If they play in bigger areas it means they have to accelerate more and sports medical science has proved that running above 20kmph risks more muscle injuries.\n\nSlot does not play games of 11 vs 11 in training as most coaches do and works hard on the mental side of the sport. He has even convinced the Feyenoord players that the more games they play the stronger they will become.\n\nIt does feel that it is only a matter of time before Slot makes his move to England. There is, of course, an obvious comparison with Manchester United's Erik ten Hag who moved from Ajax, and there is always that concern over how Dutch coaches fare outside of the Eredivisie which is clearly not one of Europe's strongest leagues.\n\nYet Liverpool will certainly have run the numbers and the data on Slot, who now has Champions League experience beating Celtic and Lazio but failing to get through the group, and will have been impressed by what they have seen. Not least because his football and pressing game is far more attacking than Ten Hag's. Interestingly when Ten Hag won the league with Ajax it was Slot who won the Rinus Michels Award for Eredivisie manager of the season.\n\nRecommended\n\nStatistics that show why Slot may be perfect fit for Liverpool\n\nRead more\n\nFeyenoord finished third in Slot's first campaign - they were fifth the season before. They subsequently were first and are now second. But that does not provide the full picture as Slot completely overhauled their negative playing style. The club wanted him to do it and, interestingly so did the players, with the coach exploding the myth that 'you can only work with what you have got'. Instead, with a fierce pressing game in which Feyenoord go man-for-man with their opponents all over the pitch, he showed that players can change.\n\nInterestingly it was one of his main motivations for joining Feyenoord: to show the world it can be done.\n\nFor example in Slot's first team meeting he played clips of the 2021 Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City and asked the simple question: why were there so few chances despite there being so many good attacking players?\n\nThe answer was equally as simple: it was because all those attackers also made incredible defensive runs to nullify their opponents. Slot then contrasted that with the lack of running Feyenoord had completed the season before and compared the distance covered - far less - to his previous AZ side.\n\nHis approach was also simple - as is his mantra: his teams defend by attacking. While Klopp's Liverpool wait for 'pressing triggers' Slot asks his players to press all the time which sounds exhausting but, after a few weeks, he believes becomes second nature.\n\nThe next part of that is to try to control games by emphasising ball possession which is straight out of Guardiola's play-book.\n\nSlot believes that more defensive football - as espoused by Jose Mourinho - is not only more tiring but less stimulating for the players. He argues they cannot improve by primarily thinking about defending.\n\nIn the Netherlands they call it indoctrineren (indoctrinate) and Slot bombarded the players with stats, with clips and with far more sophisticated and intense training sessions in which every minute is accounted for. It is a clear 'train-the-way-you-play' approach.\n\nImportantly, Slot has achieved all of this on a shoestring - Feyenoord have made significant money in the transfer market every season he has been there - and he has undoubtedly improved players and their value. He likes to work primarily with young players and is popular in the dressing room. There is an inherent risk, given the league he would be coming from, but Slot certainly appears to fit the mould of a 'head coach' whose priority is the training pitch, which Liverpool want, rather than a manager in their new structure led by Michael Edwards and director of football Richard Hughes.\n\nArne Slot and his methods\n\nSlot's Feyenoord were built on a shoestring but delivered fierce pressing and exciting attacking football", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange_Postecoglou", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ange Postecoglou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Advocaat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Advocaat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Lazio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.

Talk of R\u00faben Amorim taking over has cooled while there is a chance that the option decided on could be more left field.\n\nIn recent days, one name has shot up the odds for the job to become one of the new favorites: Arne Slot. And now, according to The Times, Slot is a 'leading candidate' for Liverpool.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool Academy star has earned 'trusted player' status and it could affect transfer plan\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool 'agrees Nike to Adidas kit switch' for 2025/26 as FSG set to surpass $61m figure\n\nFeyenoord boss Slot, 45, has compiled a strong body of work in the Netherlands and won the Eredivisie last season. His high-pressing style of play and proven track record of improving players are said to have impressed the Reds. This year, Feyenoord is second in the league standings but has won the Dutch cup.\n\nSlot has impressed since making his move into management. An attacking midfielder during his playing days, in which he turned out for FC Zwolle, NAC Breda, Sparta Rotterdam and PEC Zwolle, he became a youth coach at the latter of those clubs upon his retirement in 2013 before becoming an assistant at Cambuur.\n\nIn 2016, he was made interim coach alongside Sipke Hulshoff of the Leeuwarden-based side, before leaving the club the following year to become John van den Brom's assistant at AZ Alkmaar. He would then go on to succeed Van den Brom as the club's head coach.\n\nHis first season in charge was brought to a premature end by the COVID-19 pandemic, with AZ only trailing leaders Ajax on goal difference with nine games remaining before the campaign was abandoned. His work at the club though was attracting interest from Feyenoord, and later that year, he was sacked by AZ after negotiating a deal with the Rotterdam club.\n\nLiverpool home shirt 2023/2024 Get the Liverpool home kit\n\nLiverpool's home shirt for the 2023/2024 campaign pays homage to Bill Shankly and the legendary Reds manager's final season in charge at Anfield. The Nike shirt features a bright red design with a bold white contrast on the colour and cuffs.\n\nPrices start from \u00a359.95\n\nNike Get it here\n\nSlot's first season at Feyenoord saw them finish third behind Ajax and PSV, while also reaching the final of the Europa Conference League, where they were beaten by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Roma. His second season would see Feyenoord clinch its first Eredivisie title since 2017, and also lead to Slot being linked with a move to the Premier League.\n\nHe was touted for the vacant Tottenham job last summer, having also reportedly been in the running for the Leeds United job earlier in the year. Slot though would end up signing a new deal at Feyenoord, keeping him at the club until 2026.\n\nSlot's attacking brand of football has caught the eye in recent years, and has also seen him compared with Pep Guardiola (via TalkSport). What's more, he has already earmarked the Premier League as his next destination.\n\n\"My next step will not be a club in Holland,\" he said last year (via Sky Sports). \"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nAnd when asked about the possibility of becoming Liverpool boss following Klopp's announcement in January, Slot didn't exactly rule it out. \"What answer can I give that there will be no headlines about it? So next question!\" Slot said, via Voetbal Primeur.\n\nWith the 45-year-old already keen on a move to the Premier League, he could be a name to keep an eye on over the coming weeks. The search is continuing for Klopp's successor and Slot appears to be high up the list.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_addison@liverpool.com", "name": "Matt Addison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "james_findlater@liverpool.com", "name": "James Findlater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Amorim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Amorim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_van_den_Brom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John van den Brom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C._Reserves_and_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C.

The Dutchman, 45, won the Eredivisie last May and lifted the Dutch Cup three days ago.\n\nThis, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not the first time Slot has been tipped for a move to the Premier League.

Both white-clad clubs were being linked mid-season, something that the manager was not a fan of.\n\nSpeaking last year, he said: \"I think Leeds is a very nice club. The moment in the middle of the season, where you still have so much to play for at Feyenoord, I didn't think that was a good time to leave for England.\"\n\nThere is a feeling Slot is coming to the end of his cycle at Feyenoord after three years at the helm, during which a Premier League switch has infrequently been touted. He previously underlined he wishes to leave his club \"in a positive way\".\n\nHaving won the cup after last year's league success, the summer might be the perfect time to bow out - which is Liverpool's start date. Timing is on FSG's side.\n\nSlot has always been open about his revere for the Premier League. He told ESPN only a year ago: \"I think that at some point there will come a time when, as a trainer, you will also look abroad... The Premier League is of course the number one competition in Europe.\"\n\nA month later, he went on to state: \"A normal next step would be to go abroad and I've always said that the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nLiverpool, of course, fit that profile and some. But there is another admission of his that puts the Reds in a strong position and gives them an advantage Spurs and Leeds clearly do not boast.\n\nSlot said: \"There are always clubs that come along that - if it were up to me - you can't say 'no' to.\"\n\nLiverpool would surely be one of them, offering a job that few managers could resist - and perhaps for Slot, one he cannot turn down, even if it means coming in after Klopp.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaac_johnson@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Isaac Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29051862.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2148002473.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Guardiola disciple who coaches like Mikel Arteta", "body": "Slot, who bombards his players with statistics, won the Dutch Cup at the weekend while operating with a fraction of his rivals' finances\n\nArne Slot is the disciple of Pep Guardiola who has strong similarities to Mikel Arteta and Roberto De Zerbi in the way he coaches and the intense playing style he demands.\n\nSlot's Feyenoord side play some of the most exciting, entertaining, high-energy, attacking football on the Continent. It should come as little surprise then that Liverpool are interested in hiring him as J\u00fcrgen Klopp's successor - with Slot a friend of Klopp's assistant Pep Lijnders, who is also leaving Anfield.\n\nThe 45-year-old former midfielder is renowned for his precise coaching methods and his attention to detail. So precise is he that that the 'rondo' - the training drill whereby players attempt to keep the ball while a smaller group aim to intercept - is made extremely specific at Feyenoord.\n\nSlot is concerned the drill does not allow players to 'scan' (to check the options on the pitch) which is one of the fundamentals of passing and so he insists that they can take only one touch, that they cannot return possession to the player who passed to them and, crucially, that the ball always stays below the knee. Players are even encouraged to consider which foot they are passing with.\n\nTelegraph Sport learnt this, as Slot led Feyenoord last year to only their second Dutch league title this century, after being given detailed access into the way he works and his methodology - and ambition.\n\nThis campaign Feyenoord have won the Dutch Cup and are second to PSV Eindhoven in the league - although it should be factored in that he is operating with a fraction of his rivals' finances and also those of Ajax, who are 24 points behind.\n\nFeyenoord may traditionally be the third biggest club in the Netherlands but that gives a false impression. They are far behind the Dutch giants in terms of budget and had been, in recent years, frankly one of its most boring, defensive teams especially under Slot's predecessor Dick Advocaat. How that has changed.\n\nDutchman long fancied by English clubs\n\nLiverpool are not the first Premier League club to take an interest in Slot who joined Feyenoord from AZ Alkmaar in 2021. But Liverpool are clearly the biggest and most serious proposition. Leeds United tried to hire him in February 2023 after sacking Jesse Marsch (and he would be a natural successor to Marcelo Bielsa) but Slot stayed in Rotterdam.\n\nTottenham Hotspur then made a move before they eventually brought in Ange Postecoglou - with Slot surprisingly deciding to stay at Feyenoord and signing a new contract.\n\nGiven that Feyenoord's style of play is so demanding, it is impressive they suffer so few injuries - in contrast to Leeds under Bielsa, which is why Feyenoord were so interested in Slot.\n\nSlot's eye for detail fuels Feyenoord success\n\nThe demanding attention to detail is a theme. For example, Slot has concluded that in training sessions for the days immediately after games the players should work in a space no longer than 40 metres. If they play in bigger areas it means they have to accelerate more and sports medical science has proved that running above 20kmph risks more muscle injuries.\n\nSlot does not play games of 11 vs 11 in training as most coaches do and works hard on the mental side of the sport. He has even convinced the Feyenoord players that the more games they play the stronger they will become.\n\nIt does feel that it is only a matter of time before Slot makes his move to England. There is, of course, an obvious comparison with Manchester United's Erik ten Hag who moved from Ajax, and there is always that concern over how Dutch coaches fare outside of the Eredivisie which is clearly not one of Europe's strongest leagues.\n\nYet Liverpool will certainly have run the numbers and the data on Slot, who now has Champions League experience beating Celtic and Lazio but failing to get through the group, and will have been impressed by what they have seen. Not least because his football and pressing game is far more attacking than Ten Hag's. Interestingly when Ten Hag won the league with Ajax it was Slot who won the Rinus Michels Award for Eredivisie manager of the season.\n\nRecommended\n\nStatistics that show why Slot may be perfect fit for Liverpool Read more\n\nFeyenoord finished third in Slot's first campaign - they were fifth the season before. They subsequently were first and are now second. But that does not provide the full picture as Slot completely overhauled their negative playing style. The club wanted him to do it and, interestingly so did the players, with the coach exploding the myth that 'you can only work with what you have got'. Instead, with a fierce pressing game in which Feyenoord go man-for-man with their opponents all over the pitch, he showed that players can change.\n\nInterestingly it was one of his main motivations for joining Feyenoord: to show the world it can be done.\n\nFor example in Slot's first team meeting he played clips of the 2021 Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City and asked the simple question: why were there so few chances despite there being so many good attacking players?\n\nThe answer was equally as simple: it was because all those attackers also made incredible defensive runs to nullify their opponents. Slot then contrasted that with the lack of running Feyenoord had completed the season before and compared the distance covered - far less - to his previous AZ side.\n\nHis approach was also simple - as is his mantra: his teams defend by attacking. While Klopp's Liverpool wait for 'pressing triggers' Slot asks his players to press all the time which sounds exhausting but, after a few weeks, he believes becomes second nature.\n\nThe next part of that is to try to control games by emphasising ball possession which is straight out of Guardiola's play-book.\n\nSlot believes that more defensive football - as espoused by Jose Mourinho - is not only more tiring but less stimulating for the players. He argues they cannot improve by primarily thinking about defending.\n\nIn the Netherlands they call it indoctrineren (indoctrinate) and Slot bombarded the players with stats, with clips and with far more sophisticated and intense training sessions in which every minute is accounted for. It is a clear 'train-the-way-you-play' approach.\n\nImportantly, Slot has achieved all of this on a shoestring - Feyenoord have made significant money in the transfer market every season he has been there - and he has undoubtedly improved players and their value. He likes to work primarily with young players and is popular in the dressing room. There is an inherent risk, given the league he would be coming from, but Slot certainly appears to fit the mould of a 'head coach' whose priority is the training pitch, which Liverpool want, rather than a manager in their new structure led by Michael Edwards and director of football Richard Hughes.\n\nArne Slot and his methods\n\nSlot's Feyenoord were built on a shoestring but delivered fierce pressing and exciting attacking football Read more", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_burt@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Jason Burt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange_Postecoglou", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ange Postecoglou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Advocaat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Advocaat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Lazio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.

J\u00fcrgen Klopp has just five matches left at the helm and Feyenoord boss Arne Slot has emerged as a leading contender to take over from him.\n\nEarlier in the week, The Athletic reported that Sporting CP head coach R\u00faben Amorim was increasingly unlikely to be the man chosen to replace Klopp. And now it has emerged that Slot is the preferred option for the Reds.\n\nLiverpool has been impressed by Slot's high-intensity team and his style of play, according to The Times, as well as the Dutchman's track record of improving the players he has at his disposal. But just how good is he?\n\nREAD MORE: What Arne Slot 'thinks about Liverpool' having previously 'turned down' Tottenham and Chelsea\n\nREAD MORE: 'I've spoken to Arne Slot and he would be a really good J\u00fcrgen Klopp replacement at Liverpool'\n\nFeyenoord won the league title last season, having only previously won it once this century. This year, the Eredivisie side sits second in the table. PSV is the runaway leader, ahead by nine points with four matches left to play.\n\nBut Slot has picked up silverware again, beating NEC Nijmegen (the team that Pep Lijnders briefly managed) in the Dutch cup final last weekend. Brazilian forward Igor Paix\u00e3o scored the only goal of the game.\n\nIn the 146 matches that Slot has overseen at Feyenoord since taking over in 2021, he has won 94 times and lost 23, giving him a win rate of just under two-thirds. In that period, his side has scored 329 goals (an average of 2.25 per game) and conceded 147, which is marginally over one per game.\n\nSlot had 58 matches in charge of AZ Alkmaar prior to that where he won 32 times (55 per cent win ratio). He managed them in Europe (both the Europa League and the Champions League) and finished second to Ajax in the season that was curtailed due to COVID. He beat Napoli with Alkmaar but was fired because the club was annoyed with him for flirting with a move to Feyenoord.\n\nAt AZ Alkmaar, Slot picked up more points per game than any other coach in the club's history. He took them into European competition and punched above his weight before earning the move to Feyenoord where he has been similarly as successful at squeezing the most out of his resources.\n\nLiverpool.com says: Slot is quite clearly a very talented coach and he knows how to get the most from a group of players. The challenge will be doing that at Anfield where the pressure to succeed is much larger and there are many more things to deal with.

There have been no fresh contacts.\n\n\"However, Amorim was in London this week with his agent for a meeting with West Ham. Despite these conversations, my understanding for now is that Amorim to West Ham will not happen - there is no agreement and it looks really unlikely.

The Reds' hierarchy have made contact with Feyenoord in the last 24 hours and has been told Slot is \"100 per cent interested\" in taking the job.\n\nLiverpool's decision to speed up the process appears to have been taken to ward off interest from Bayern Munich in Slot, whose teams play a similar brand of attacking, fast-paced football to Klopp's.\n\nBut they will have to meet Feyenoord's financial demands. An initial offer under \u00a38m is understood to have been rejected, with Feyenoord looking for sizeable compensation before allowing Slot to talk to Liverpool.\n\nDutch sources have indicated that a move now looks almost certain but Feyenoord will not allow Slot to go on the cheap. Feyenoord, in second place in the Eredivisie and trailing PSV Eindhoven by nine points, travel to Go Ahead Eagles on Thursday but have cancelled a planned press conference due to speculation.\n\nSlot was identified as a candidate whose playing style, values and ability to improve players on the training pitch align closely with the club's values.\n\nSporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim, Brentford's Thomas Frank and Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi have also been discussed.\n\nWhile Liverpool aren't close to making an appointment - indeed it is understood that formal interviews are yet to take place - there is a sense that things are moving at Anfield. Bayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso ruled himself out last month while West Ham's links to Amorim came as Liverpool's interest in him cooled.\n\npreviously reported that the Reds were prepared to make an \"out-of-the-box\" appointment ahead of Michael Edwards' reunion with Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group as CEO of football. Their detailed recruitment process has seen director of research Will Spearman heavily involved - and Slot's inclusion on the shortlist should not come as a surprise.\n\nIndeed his name figured prominently on a list prepared for by data specialists Analytics FC back in February. Their head of content Alex Stewart told Slot is a \"good stylistic fit\" and his teams play with the same aggression as Klopp's side, favouring longer passes and quick breaks.\n\nSlot's CV is impressive; he won the Dutch Cup last weekend with Feyenoord and won the Eredivisie in 2022-23. He is charismatic and adored by the club's supporters, while he was also a contender for the Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur vacancies last season, although opted against pursuing either.\n\nHis stance would likely change if Liverpool formalise their interest, with the prospect of replacing Klopp understood to appeal. Feyenoord will likely fight to keep him, though.\n\nThe Reds appear to be trying to steal a march on their rivals in what promises to be a busy managerial market in the summer.\n\nAs well as Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are trying to fill managerial vacancies, while Manchester United could join that crop of clubs if Ineos decide to dispense with Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe number of potential candidates seems to be dwindling, with Julian Nagelsmann having committed himself to Germany until 2026.\n\nDe Zerbi, who is admired by incoming Liverpool director of football Richard Hughes, also has admirers at Bayern Munich and there was an element of politicking when news of West Ham's interest in Amorim emerged earlier this week. The Portuguese was a heavy favourite for the Liverpool job but that interest appears to have cooled as Slot becomes a contender.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_douglas@inews.co.uk", "name": "Mark Douglas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Sports Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Ahead_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Go Ahead Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEI_201146132.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2500px%2C1411px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Reports that previous favourite Ruben Amorim was now 'unlikely' to take the job suggested that FSG had a preferred alternative.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, their number one choice became apparent. By the evening time of the same day, an update from journalist Ben Jacobs shows that things are getting very serious indeed for that candidate.\n\nBefore Monday's news broke about Amorim, few would have placed Feyenoord manager Arne Slot in the conversation for Liverpool.\n\nHowever, there is a lot to like about the 45-year-old. Unless something drastic happens over the next few days, it looks like Michael Edwards has found his man.\n\nAnd according to Jacobs, posting on X, Edwards and Liverpool are now ready to take things to the next level with Slot.\n\n\"Liverpool will intensify their pursuit of Arne Slot this week,\" says the journalist.\n\n\"Contact expected with Slot and Feyenoord. Understand compensation Feyenoord want is \u20ac10m+ [\u00a38m+]. Not as high as the \u20ac20m [\u00a317m] Spurs quoted. Things moving fast. LFC have a good relationship with Slot's agent Rafaela Pimenta.\"\n\nThere's not really much getting around this unfortunately. Slot is an underwhelming choice to replace Klopp at Liverpool.\n\nThat is not to say that the Dutchman is not a top manager. He has done very well at Feyenoord and even AZ Alkmaar before that. But with respect to those clubs, they're not Liverpool.\n\nNevertheless, it's important that Reds fans get behind Slot, if - as expected - it does end up being him.\n\nFrom Edwards' point of view, there is a lot to like about Slot, too. According to Dutch football expert Marcel van der Kraan for TalkSPORT, the former PEC Zwolle midfielder plays an 'ultra attacking' brand of football and is a disciple of Pep Guardiola. Sounds good.\n\nMore than that though, Slot has also shown himself to be effective on a tight budget at Feyenoord. He's also overperformed in Europe and won over supporters at a tight-knit family style club.

Slot first made his mark in senior management with AZ Alkmaar in 2019 and his reputation has been on the rise ever since.\n\nHe took the reins at Feyenoord in 2021 and led them to an Eredivisie title two years later, as well as securing a KNVB Cup victory just last weekend. Over the past few years, Leeds United, Tottenham and Chelsea have all expressed interest in Slot.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot could become next Liverpool manager with club having scoured Europe\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool's manager options after Amorim snub - Carragher's favourite to The Special One\n\nHowever, The Times now reports that Liverpool are eyeing up the 45-year-old as a potential next manager.\n\nLiverpool have now identified Slot as a leading candidate. And his sudden cancellation of a Wednesday press conference to preview an upcoming Eredivisie match has raised eyebrows.\n\nWhat do you think of Arne Slot cancelling his press conference? Let us know in the comments section\n\nSlot's contract with Feyenoord runs until 2026 and doesn't include a release clause. However, it's suggested that Liverpool could secure his services for a mere \u00a38.6million - significantly less than the cost of appointing Sporting's Ruben Amorim, reports the Express.\n\nSlot, known for his 4-2-3-1 formation and aggressive attacking style, is likely to impress Anfield's top brass, including CEO of Football Michael Edwards and incoming sporting director Richard Hughes, who are overseeing the appointment process. Often referred to as 'The Pep Guardiola of the Eredivisie', Slot is a mate of Klopp's assistant, Pepijn Lijnders, who is also set to leave Anfield this summer.\n\nLiverpool's list of potential managers is dwindling, with Xabi Alonso committing to stay at Bayer Leverkusen after guiding them to the Bundesliga title, and rumours about Amorim fading.\n\nBrighton boss Roberto De Zerbi, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be a top priority for the Merseyside club.

on from Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim, who looked like leading candidates to get the Anfield job at one stage.\n\nThe Premier League club admire Slot because of his attacking football and his attitude towards recruitment.\n\nThe Premier League club feels the Feyenoord boss can work collaboratively with the club chiefs as far as recruitment and big decisions are concerned.\n\nThe Reds are not only

Monday.\n\nSlot, 45, led Feyenoord to their first league title in six years last season and won the Dutch Cup on Sunday.\n\nHe had been a front runner to take over at Tottenham a year ago before ruling himself out of contention.\n\nSky Sports, the BBC and The Times all reported that Slot is now leading the race for the unenviable task of following Klopp at Anfield.\n\nHowever, the Reds could face competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona, who are also looking for new coaches next season.\n\nBayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite when Klopp announced his decision in January to stand down at the end of the season after nearly nine years in the role.\n\nHowever, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title.\n\nSporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool vacancy but reportedly held talks with West Ham on Monday about replacing David Moyes next season.\n\nSlot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.\n\nHe led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.\n\nSlot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.\n\nThe Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nKlopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.\n\nLiverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord",

The new named linked as next LFC manager", "body": "The latest name thrown into the discussion of the next Liverpool manager is Feyenoord's Arne Slot, but who is he and what could he offer at Anfield?\n\nWe are no closer to discovering who will take over from Jurgen Klopp this summer, but Sporting boss Ruben Amorim became the latest to be all but ruled out - he flew to England for talks with West Ham.\n\nSlot has quickly become the new favourite among the bookmakers, but as he will be a relatively unknown quantity for many, let's get to know him a little bit better.\n\nThe 45-year-old spent the entirety of his playing career in the Netherlands and has followed a similar path in management to date, first with AZ Alkmaar and currently Feyenoord.\n\nHe prefers to deploy a 4-2-3-1 formation but it is far from rigid, his style was previously described to i as \"high-energy attacking football in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 with two deep-lying midfielders and a reliance on wingers to create chances.\"\n\nHis Feyenoord side, whom he has managed since 2021/22, currently boasts the best defensive record in the Eredivisie - conceding just 23 goals in 30 games - and has the second-most goals scored (77).\n\nAs per the Coaches Voice, Slot doesn't \"overcommit to the high press,\" with his teams \"comfortable dropping into a more reserved block\" if the opportunity to win the ball back is not there.\n\nA key difference to that of Liverpool under Klopp.\n\nHe plays an attractive, attacking brand of football and is someone who is not afraid to trust in youth, while his man-management skills have also been widely praised.\n\nSlot takes a possession-based approach and demands his side to be intense, he doesn't stand for casual movement - which would be a carryover from Klopp.\n\nExplaining his approach with Feyenoord, Slot told UEFA: \"We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity.\n\n\"When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nThat last sentence is something we have always heard from Klopp!\n\nHe has been a senior manager for only five years but has drawn comparisons to Marcelo Bielsa's style, he likes his full-backs high up the pitch and his centre-backs to move wider.\n\nWith a place in the Europa Conference League final in his first season at the club, and having won the Eredivisie title in his second and the KNVB Cup in his third, it's understandable Slot has attracted interest.\n\nOnly last summer, he was a strong candidate to take over at Tottenham and despite the growing spotlight, Feyenoord technical director Dennis te Kloese is working under the assumption he will not be on a new manager search this year.\n\nHe told Voetbal International:\n\n\"I think it is logical that he is in such a good position. It is very special how he has manifested himself in recent years and has really given Feyenoord a face.\n\n\"We responded by extending his contract. In any case, we assume that he will also be our trainer next year.\n\n\"We have experienced this situation before and will take good care of our own interests.\"\n\nThe Liverpool job is all-encompassing, a manager cannot simply tick one box, he has to tick plenty - and a lot of that revolves around character.\n\nSky Sports previously described him as \"engaging, polite, very smiley, he's hot presence and charisma - and he's funny.\"\n\n\"He can be angry with his players, of course,\" Dennis van Eersel, of Dutch national TV channel RTV, explained. \"But he also puts his arm around them. They like him because he's built a harmony at the club.\"\n\nIf you were wondering, he can speak fluent English, and during the time Tottenham were linked last year, he spoke on his future plans, as quoted by Sky Sports.\n\nHe said: \"My next step will not be a club in Holland.\n\n\"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"", "source": {"uri": "thisisanfield.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "This Is Anfield"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joanna_durkan@thisisanfield.com", "name": "Joanna Durkan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voetbal_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voetbal International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/Arne-Slot-FI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 727, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

On Monday afternoon, The Athletic's David Ornstein revealed that a move for Sporting CP's Ruben Amorim was 'unlikely' ahead of the 39-year-old's unsuccessful talks with West Ham United. The Reds have now turned their attentions to Feyenoord boss Arne Slot.\n\nAccording to journalist Ben Jacobs, Liverpool will 'intensify' their pursuit of Slot this week, with the end of the 2023/24 season and Jurgen Klopp's reign drawing ever closer. The 45-year-old, dubbed a \"super attacking\" manager by Dutch journalist Marcel van der Kraan, has impressed over the last two seasons with the Rotterdam-based giants.\n\nLast term, Slot helped secure an unexpected Eredivisie title ahead of the likes of Ajax and PSV Eindhoven. Though only able to achieve a second-placed finish at best this term, he has still brought home the KNVB Cup following their triumph over NEC Nijmegen last weekend.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Slot has earned a points per match record of 2.12 across the current campaign, having taken charge of 43 games.\n\nJacobs understands that Feyenoord want a compensation package in excess of \u20ac10m (close to \u00a39m) for their manager, which is not as high as the \u20ac20m (\u00a317m) Spurs were quoted last summer. Things are 'moving fast', and Liverpool have a positive relationship with his agent, Rafaela Pimenta. Providing an update on X, Jacobs said:\n\n\"Liverpool will intensify their pursuit of Arne Slot this week. Contact expected with Slot and Feyenoord. Understand compensation Feyenoord want is \u20ac10m+. Not as high as the \u20ac20m Spurs quoted. Things moving fast. #LFC have a good relationship with Slot's agent Rafaela Pimenta.\"\n\nLiverpool starting to think about 'formal manager interviews' The Reds are hoping to appoint a worthy successor to Jurgen Klopp\n\nJacobs has recently told GIVEMESPORT (23rd April) that Liverpool are starting to consider formal manager interviews as they hurry along to the next process of replacing Jurgen Klopp. They will need to think hard about a potential successor to the German boss, who has guided the Reds to one of the most successful periods in their history, having won both the Champions League and Premier League.\n\nThe journalist has revealed that Liverpool are 'on track', having earmarked mid to late April as the time to start approaching and interviewing managers about potentially taking the hot seat at Anfield. However, the date of those talks can differentiate, with the six-time European Cup winners keen not to disrupt a manager's season if there's something to play for in the late stages.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Transfermarkt, correct as of 24-04-24.\n\nRelated How Liverpool Could Raise Over \u00a3170m This Summer Without Selling Mo Salah It looks to be a big summer of spending at a post-Klopp Liverpool.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_Nijmegen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NEC Nijmegen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger_Management", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/who-is-arne-slot-dutch-manager-now-favourite-for-liverpool-job.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 2915, "textEnd": 2925}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Slot signed a new three-year contract with the Rotterdam-based team in May 2023, thereby committing himself to the club until 2026.\n\nSources have told ESPN that the Liverpool hierarchy, led by Edwards and Hogan, believe that Slot fits all their criteria in terms of style of play, personality and ability to work within the club's structure.\n\nThere is an acceptance within Anfield that Feyenoord will attempt to hold onto Slot, but there is also a hope that the lure of the Premier League could prompt the former AZ Alkmaar coach to take the opportunity to move to England.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Sports Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0423%2Fr1323281_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-10-", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 971}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

He was previously monitored by Premier League clubs Tottenham, Chelsea and Leeds.\n\nFeyenoord have soared high with Slot at the helm of the club. Under his leadership, Feyenoord lifted the KNVB Cup last weekend and also secured their first league title in six years.\n\nUnder Slot, Feyenoord have emerged as a strong defensive side in the opposition's half, they top the Eredivisie for tackles won in the opposition's final third.\n\nAccording to the statistics, they are the best defensive side and the second-best attacking unit in the Dutch League. Slot usually names a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formation which fits Liverpool's style of play.\n\nLast May, he signed a new contract with Feyenoord, which will keep him at the club until 2026. But since then he has expressed his desire to take a new step in his career.\n\nAnother manager who has been heavily rumoured with Liverpool has been Sporting Lisbon manager Ruben Amorim. However, according to recent reports, Amorim is no longer in consideration for the job.\n\nIn January this year, Klopp announced his decision to step down from his position after spending nine years with the club.\n\nKlopp arrived at Anfield in 2015, changed the club's fortune and established one of the best sporting rivalries with Manchester City.\n\nKlopp's reign brought a revolution for the Reds in the Premier League, as they lifted the UEFA Champions League, Premier League, FIFA Club World Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Super Cup, as well as the FA Community Shield.

Although he was reportedly considered the club's initial top target, Spurs' attentions quickly turned towards Celtic's Ange Postecoglou.\n\nExplaining last summer why he chose not to leave - and perhaps foreboding a move to Liverpool this summer - Slot explained: \"I'm not done here yet.

It was felt then that it was only a matter of time before he joined one of Europe's top clubs having already turned down a number of opportunities.\n\nSlot rose to prominence after guiding Feyenoord to only their second Eredivisie title success this century last season. Last weekend he added the Dutch Cup to his honours list.\n\nOne of the attractions of Slot is the style of football achieved on a modest budget. A year ago, he was being talked about much like Alonso in the Bundesliga in 2024, as Feyenoord took on and beat Ajax and reached the Europa League quarter-finals. A year earlier he led the club to the first Europa Conference League final.\n\nSlot shifted perceptions of Feyenoord from a dull, defensive side to one of the most exciting in the Eredivisie. He has been described as a football disciple of Pep Guardiola, with a coaching style similar to Mikel Arteta and Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nDe Zerbi has also been referenced as a contender for the Anfield post.\n\nLiverpool's recruitment process is being overseen by Michael Edwards, who recently returned as owner Fenway Sports Group football chief executive, with sporting director Richard Hughes. Hughes officially starts in his new role this summer, but will undoubtedly have a huge input in the identity of the next manager.\n\nAs an up-and-coming coach whose achievements give the impression he is punching above his club's financial weight, it is easy to see why Slot has so many admirers at Anfield.\n\nArne Slot and his methods\n\nSlot's Feyenoord were built on a shoestring but delivered fierce pressing and exciting attacking football", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Sports Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dIXt76p.1fPEYeU8sxsu8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/be932d0726e49add72c213d2e78b32e0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

And with top target Xabi Alonso announcing he will stay at Bayer Leverkusen moving forward after winning the Bundesliga, the Reds have shifted their focus elsewhere.\n\nSporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim was on the club's radar but he's also planning to stay in Portugal. Now, Liverpool has identified Feyenoord gaffer Arne Slot as a leading candidate to take over for Klopp in 2024-25, via Mark Ogden of ESPN.\n\nThat being said, ESPN's sources say that both Barcelona and Bayern Munich are also interested in Slot, which means Liverpool may have some competition for his services.\n\nSlot's managerial resume\n\nLiverpool will continue to assess other candidates, but Slot is an interesting option. The Dutchman was appointed as Feyenoord manager in July of 2021 and has compiled a 64.3 winning percentage since then, leading the Eredivisie giants to the title in 2022-23. They were also the runner-up in the 2021-22 UEFA Europa Conference League. Prior to joining the club, Slot was in charge of AZ Alkmaar for just over a year.\n\nSlot is an advocate for an attacking brand of football, which is undoubtedly appealing to Liverpool because Klopp is very similar. He also has an impressive track record of developing young talent. Slot only tasted defeat twice last season en route to the most prized trophy in the Eredivisie.\n\nDifficult for Liverpool to replace Klopp\n\nLet's be honest. It will be extremely difficult for the Merseysiders to replace a coach like Klopp, who has an infectious energy and a special connection with all of his players and the fans. The German has enjoyed boatloads of success at Anfield, winning eight trophies in total. That includes a Premier League title, a Champions League title, and two Carabao Cups. Liverpool was also a runner-up in Europe's most prized competition on two occasions.\n\nKlopp reportedly told the Liverpool board last November his intention to step down this summer, with the club making it clear they will take a \"data-led\" approach to find their next boss, per ESPN. Slot reportedly fits their criteria perfectly.\n\nAlthough the 45-year-old put pen to paper on a new deal with the Rotterdam outfit that will last until 2026, the Reds do believe they can lure Slot away from the club for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with Liverpool. Slot already turned down managerial opportunities with Chelsea and Tottenham previously.\n\nReds looking to finish Klopp era strong\n\nLiverpool was shockingly knocked out of Europa last week by Serie A standouts Atalanta in the quarterfinals, leaving them with just one trophy left to play for: The Premier League title. Klopp's men are currently second in the table behind Arsenal ahead of the Merseyside Derby against Everton on Wednesday.\n\nWith just five games left on the schedule, the Reds must be at their absolute best. After visiting the Toffees, West Ham, Tottenham, Aston Villa, and Wolves are up next. One slip-up could cost them a chance to finish the Klopp era on top.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Everyone thought Ruben Amorim was destined to be the club's next manager. But things haven't panned out that way.\n\nAmorim at this current moment in time seems like an unlikely candidate. Instead, Liverpool have turned towards other options.\n\nWho those options are at this stage we can only speculate. It's a list that currently includes plenty of names. But there is one who seems to have emerged out of nowhere and who is on a lot of peoples' lips at the moment.\n\nOne possible candidate for Liverpool right now could be Arne Slot. The 45-year-old has done a great job at Feyenoord winning the Eredivisie league title there last season.\n\nHe's still relatively young but players an exciting brand of football, and he's now been tipped to succeed at Liverpool.\n\nSpeaking on Ziggo Sport as per FC Updates, both Wim Jonk and Marco van Basten - two iconic names in Dutch football - have backed Slot to do well at Liverpool.\n\n\"He has given Feyenoord a face,\" Jonk said.\n\n\"Just like Peter Bosz does now at PSV, and Erik ten Hag years ago at Ajax. Arne has made great strides, so in that respect I would like it. Especially at a club like Liverpool, which is of course a bit like the Feyenoord of England with the attacking football they play there.\"\n\nMarco van Basten agreed.\n\n\"I hope he stays in the Netherlands for a long time, because it is an enrichment for Dutch football. He can really go anywhere: Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I am really convinced of that.\"\n\n\"I am convinced he can do it anywhere.

Sporting CP coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nBut with Liverpool aware of rival interest in Slot from Bayern Munich and Barcelona, contact has been made with Feyenoord in an effort to win the race for the former

it will take an offer of at least \u00a310m to prise him away from De Kuip.\n\nIf the Dutchman is appointed Liverpool's new manager, he will likely bring several members of his coaching staff with

was reportedly in contact with Feyenoord about their manager's position.\n\nAfter becoming Feyenoord boss in the summer of 2021, Slot led the club to the Europa Conference League final in his first season in charge.\n\nSlot then guided the Dutch giants to the 2022-23 Eredivisie crown, ending Feyenoord's six-year wait for a league title.\n\nThe Feyenoord boss recently claimed his second major

Now Arne Slot is the favourite.\"\n\nCarragher added the scenario potentially facing Slot at Anfield differs from the one Klopp inherited in 2014 after his time in charge of Borussia Dortmund, or the one Rafa Benitez walked into in 2004 after leaving Valencia.\n\n\"I don't think it's like Benitez coming in, or Klopp,\" he said. \"Benitez coming in on the back of two LaLiga titles and a UEFA Cup, or Klopp winning a couple of league titles and getting to a Champions League final. Liverpool were actually in a different space then.\n\n\"That Liverpool team, certainly under Benitez that I was part of, we were the team trying to qualify for the top four. The same with Klopp when he came in.\n\n\"But Liverpool are in a different era now. They actually fancy themselves to challenge for the Premier League every season. Next season, in the Champions League they'd expect to get to the quarter-finals at least.\n\n\"I think it's a huge jump but he's obviously a great coach with a great track record so far. We'll see.\"\n\nGary Neville admitted his \"surprise\" at Liverpool opting for Slot as their choice to replace Klopp, adding: \"Jamie Carragher had told me two different managers so it wasn't what he was expecting either.\n\n\"He's a successful coach in Holland. I love Dutch coaches. There's a way of coaching that comes back through some of the great coaches of the game.\n\n\"Obviously it's a change going from the Dutch league to the English league. It's a very different approach to Jurgen Klopp but I don't think they could ever really appoint a manager that's got the personality, character and force of Klopp.\n\n\"It's interesting. It's obviously something that's been driven by Michael Edwards, in terms of them wanting a different approach.\n\n\"Maybe that's why Edwards left Liverpool - because he clashed with Klopp. But now he's got his own way and he's bringing in someone he thinks is going to take Liverpool forward.\n\n\"We don't know how that's going to go. The reality of it is that we've seen the post-Arsene Wenger era at Arsenal has been difficult. The post-Sir Alex Ferguson era at Manchester United has been difficult. Klopp is massive in Liverpool so they've got to try to get that right.\n\n\"We thought it was going to be Xabi Alonso originally and then Ruben Amorim. Now it's Arne Slot.\n\n\"Maybe he wasn't No 1 on the list but the fact of the matter is that, if you can't pin down who you want, you've got to move to the next one on the list. They'll still have a good coach.\"\n\nNeville believes Liverpool's set-up behind the scenes could make the transition into a post-Klopp era a smoother process than Man Utd and Arsenal endured when replacing Ferguson and Wenger, respectively.\n\n\"What Manchester United and Arsenal had when they replaced those two managers was a quite traditional, old-school approach, where the managers ran the club,\" he said.\n\n\"They didn't really have a sporting department beneath them. They were the heads of the sporting department. They were the heads of recruitment, sporting director, manager and coach - all in one.\n\n\"Liverpool have a better set-up, with more depth and more structure. There's still going to be an element of risk replacing Klopp with anybody but it has to happen. Klopp is leaving.\"\n\nSlot, who secured the KNVB Cup last weekend and led Feyenoord to their first title in six years last season, appeals to Liverpool due to his aggressive, full-throttle style.\n\nHe has drilled his team to be adept at turning defensive actions into shooting opportunities and they top the Eredivisie for tackles won in the opposition's final third.\n\nFeyenoord have the best defence in the league and the second-best offensive metrics.\n\nSlot has proved capable of improving individuals as well as the collective, while operating on a smaller budget than his core competitors, and his penchant for a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formation fits Liverpool's squad.\n\nSlot has previously been approached by Tottenham, Chelsea and Leeds. He signed a new contract last May to keep him at Feyenoord until 2026 but has referenced a desire to make the next step in his career.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He opted not to take on the Leeds job after they sacked Jesse Marsch in February last year.\n\nIt has also been reported that he ruled himself out of the running for the vacancy at Tottenham before Ange Postecoglou was appointed last summer.\n\nDespite Slot's desire to manage in the Premier League, Liverpool could face competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona as they look to replace departing coaches Thomas Tuchel and Xavi respectively.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 24 Apr 2024, 1:06 PM Last updated: Wed 24 Apr 2024, 1:31 PM", "source": {"uri":

With Liverpool approaching the 45-year-old to take over, many are wanting to pronounce his name properly.\n\nIn his native Dutch, Arne Slot is pronounced 'Arn-uh Slot'.\n\nThink about how you would say ex-Liverpool an Norway international John Arne Riise's name. Arne is pronounced in the same way.\n\nThough Slot is generally just said in the same way in English and Dutch, there are regional variations that you might hear that vary the sound.\n\nPA Media outlined how he has reached the top of Dutch football...\n\nFormer midfielder Slot, 45, spent his playing career in the Netherlands with Zwolle, Sparta Rotterdam and Breda.\n\nAfter moving into coaching roles at Cambuur and then AZ Alkmaar, Slot stepped up into the manager's job with the latter for the 2019-20 season, which was interrupted by the Covid pandemic. AZ finished second behind Ajax on goal difference in the shortened campaign.\n\nSlot left for Feyenoord in December 2020, succeeding Dick Advocaat, and brought former Arsenal and Manchester United forward Robin van Persie onto his staff.\n\nIn May 2022, Feyenoord reached the first Europa Conference League final, losing to Roma, and finished third in the Eredivisie.\n\nSlot's second season at De Kuip saw Feyenoord win the Eredivisie title - the first for the club since 2017. Earlier this month, Feyenoord beat NEC Nijmegen to lift the 2024 KNVB Cup.\n\nNo matter who eventually takes over as Liverpool's new manager, they will be expected to be able to deliver more memorable European nights at Anfield.\n\nSlot would bring plenty of that experience with him. While at AZ, Slot took his side into the Europa League - where they played Manchester United in 2019. After moving to Feyenoord, Slot guided the club to the Europa Conference League final in May 2022.\n\nEredivisie success brought with it a crack at the Champions League for 2023-24. Despite beating Celtic and Lazio in their group, the Dutch side did not qualify for the knockout stage and then lost out to Roma in the Europa League play-off round.", "source": {"uri": "thisisanfield.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "This Is Anfield"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_millne@thisisanfield.com", "name": "Sam Millne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arne_Riise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Arne Riise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta_Rotterdam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sparta Rotterdam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Cambuur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SC Cambuur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Advocaat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Advocaat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breda"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Breda"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwolle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_Nijmegen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NEC Nijmegen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Kuip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De Kuip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Liverpool didn't win every season but the home fans who made the trip to the fabled ground were rarely bored.\n\nNow it will be up to Slot to build on Klopp's success of a Premier League title, a Champions League crown, an FA Cup and two Carabao Cups. But it will also be to ensure the supporters are entertained.\n\nThat's believed to be one of the reasons Michael Edwards and soon-to-be sporting director Richard Hughes have pushed the button on Slot.\n\nThe 45-year-old Dutchman is known for bringing energetic, attacking football and is flexible in formations with 4-2-3-1 a favourite but 4-3-3 another option. He started out as a manager at AZ Alkmaar and those there suggest it took him a while to develop his style but once he found his way, it was exciting football.\n\nSlot, who is openly an admirer of Pep Guardiola, favours aggression but also considers possession important too and potentially will look to control the game more with the ball than just press.\n\nBut at Feyenoord he's brought entertainment and trophies with an Eredivisie title and a Dutch Cup.\n\nLiverpool have launched talks with Arne Slot and Feyenoord\n\nArsenal midfielder Reiss Nelson, who spent a season on loan with him in 2021-22, called him a 'great manager' who had a personal touch helping a young player away from home.\n\nFeyenoord players can't speak highly enough of him. They were delighted he turned down Tottenham last season and are understood to be gutted he now looks set to leave.\n\nThe reason Liverpool have opted for him is his age profile, character and style. He's similar to the others linked with the job in Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim. Youthfulness with just enough experience is key. They believe he ticks as many boxes as they feel any manager can that is within their reach.\n\nBut whoever they replace Klopp with will be a gamble so what better way to do that than at the Slot machine.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Reds are seeking the best candidate for the role with the German set to depart in just five games' time.\n\nSlot has impressed with Feyenoord because of his ability to get the most out of players, winning the Eredivisie last season and the Dutch cup last weekend. He plays an attractive, intense style of play and his ideas could translate nicely across to Liverpool, even if the size of the club will be a big step up.\n\nLast summer, Spurs and Chelsea both spoke with Slot but he opted to stay in the Netherlands. But Dutch journalist Martijn Krabbendam, who covers Feyenoord, says he would 'jump at the chance' to move to Anfield.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I've spoken to Arne Slot and he would be a really good J\u00fcrgen Klopp replacement at Liverpool'\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Arne Slot? 'Leading candidate' to be next Liverpool manager is 'like Pep Guardiola'\n\n\"In the Champions League he left a good impression with his football,\" Krabbendam told FR12. \"A club like Liverpool is also the only club he is leaving for. He doesn't get out of bed for Brentford.\"\n\nWith four matches remaining, Feyenoord is nine points behind PSV in the table as things stand, so it is set to miss out on retaining the title. In Europe, the Dutch side finished third in its Champions League group, ahead of Celtic but behind Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Lazio. It was then knocked out of the Europa League on penalties by AS Roma.\n\nLiverpool.com says: As a coach, there is no doubt that Slot is clearly very talented. His style of play would be appealing and it could apply nicely to the squad that Liverpool currently has. His principles are not drastically different from what Klopp has deployed and he is used to coming up against teams that he is expected to win against.\n\nBut the only real question that Liverpool would need to answer is whether the step up to the Premier League is something that Slot would be able to deal with. In order to be a success at Anfield, he would need to be able to deal with the pressures that come with the job and be able to take on an awful lot beyond just coaching. That is something that the data cannot assess but it will be very important in determining how successful he might be on Merseyside.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_addison@liverpool.com", "name": "Matt Addison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Of a man who proved himself at a lower level, at a club with lower expectations, and then gradually climbed the ladder, from Mainz to Borussia Dortmund and, eventually, to Liverpool.\n\nKlopp's journey shares a few similarities, certainly, with a coach one former Ballon D'Or winner feels would be a potentially inspired replacement in the Anfield dugout.\n\nIn his first coaching role, the Dutchman turned AZ Alkmaar into one of the most watchable sides in the Eredivisie. If the 2019/20 season had not been terminated due to the COVID pandemic, AZ might just have snatched the title from under Ajax's nose.\n\nIt would not take long for Arne Slot to get his hands on the Eredivisie trophy, however. Like Klopp at Dortmund, Slot woke something of a sleeping giant from it's slumber, guiding Feyenoord to only their second league title since the turn of the Century?\n\nThe natural next step, Marco van Basten feels, is one of the continent's A-list clubs, the Dutch legend confident that Slot can step into even Klopp's massive shoes.\n\n\"I think Slot is really good,\" Van Basten, the AC Milan icon, tells Ziggo Sport. \"I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer, because it is an enrichment for Dutch football. (But) he can really go anywhere. Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that.\n\n\"I've spoken to him a few times, and he handles the player groups very well. Of course, he is also very well versed tactically.\n\n\"I can explain his ideas well. He is calm and intelligent. As far as I am concerned, he is really a top coach. I really think he can go to any club, even difficult clubs. He is very smart in his choice of words.\"\n\nInterestingly, HITC understands that Slot could follow in Klopp's footsteps, not at Liverpool but at Dortmund. The 45-year-old, who's free-flowing attacking style has been likened to Pep Guardiola's, is one of the candidates to succeed Edin Terzic at the German giants, alongside Graham Potter.\n\n\"He has a lot of qualities and he shows it at every level,\" adds Van Basten, a Ballon D'Or winner on no fewer than three occasions. \"He first did it at AZ, and now at Feyenoord. And Feyenoord is a really complicated club. He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money.\n\n\"It could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football. You can clearly see his hand wherever he is the coach.\n\n\"I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level, because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. In the end, I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.\"\n\nSlot, once labelled the 'best coach in the world' by Feyenoord winger Alireza Jahanbakhsh, turned down Leeds United, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur back in 2023. He distanced himself from those Liverpool rumours immediately after Klopp announced his departure.\n\nLiverpool's pursuit of a new manager, meanwhile, is proving to be somewhat more difficult than expected.\n\nXabi Alonso, their first-choice target, is staying at Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen. Ruben Amorim is now in talks with West Ham - he may have reservations about potentially becoming Liverpool's David Moyes or Unai Emery - while Julian Nagelsmann extended his contract with the German national team until after the 2026 World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_owen@hitc.com", "name": "Dan Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Liverpool are reportedly interested in recruiting Feyenoord's Arne Slot as a successor to Jurgen Klopp.\n\nThe German coach announced earlier in the campaign that he would be ending his nine-year stay on Merseyside at the conclusion of the current season.\n\nKlopp has guided Liverpool to both Premier League and Champions League trophies, and the former Borussia Dortmund man still has the chance to seal a domestic double this term.\n\nThe Reds lifted their 10th EFL Cup trophy with a Wembley win over Chelsea in February, and Klopp's troops are currently in the midst of a three-way title race.\n\nLiverpool occupy second position in the Premier League standings, level on points with first-placed Arsenal with just five matches of the term remaining.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nLiverpool looking at Slot to replace Klopp?\n\nAccording to Sky Sports News, a new candidate has emerged in the race to succeed Klopp at Liverpool ahead of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nThe report claims that the Reds are keen on securing the services of Feyenoord head coach Slot, who has enjoyed a three-year spell in charge of the Dutch side.\n\nIt is understood that the Merseysiders are moving their focus away from Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim, who is no longer favourite to take over at Anfield.\n\nLille's Paulo Fonseca has also been touted as a possible replacement for Klopp, whilst a rogue contender has emerged at the beginning of this week.\n\nIt has been reported that Liverpool have held initial talks with Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Gary O'Neil over potentially swapping Molineux for Merseyside.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nSlot's time at Feyenoord\n\nSince taking the reins at Feyenoord during the summer of 2021, Slot has enjoyed a productive three-year spell at the club, especially last season.\n\nThe 45-year-old guided the Pride of South to their first Eredivisie title in six years, beating the likes of PSV Eindhoven and perennial champions Ajax to the Dutch crown.\n\nThis season has proved harder for Slot's side following a group-stage exit in the Champions League, but Feyenoord are currently unbeaten in normal time since the trip to Brendan Rodgers's Celtic on December 13.\n\nUnfortunately for Slot, the formidable form of PSV has given them a nine-point advantage at the top of the Eredivisie with four matches left, meaning that Feyenoord are unlikely to achieve back-to-back league honours.\n\nHowever, the Liverpool-linked boss has still nurtured an effective, front-footed style of play at Stadion Feijenoord - an approach which has clearly peaked the interest of the Reds.\n\nID:542027:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5043:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carter_white@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Carter White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Kuip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De Kuip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molineux_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molineux Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/23/16/arne-slot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-13", "textStart": 2288, "textEnd": 2299}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it is an enrichment for Dutch football,\" he told Dutch TV channel Ziggo Sports.\n\n\"He can really go anywhere... Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that.\n\n\"I've spoken to him a few times and I think what he does and what he sees is very strong.\n\n\"He gets along very well with the group of players, is tactically well-versed, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent.\n\n\"I think he can go to any club, even at the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent.\"\n\nFormer Netherlands midfielder Wim Jonk told the same channel: \"He (Slot) gave Feyenoord a face. Arne has made enormous strides. Liverpool is also a bit like the Feyenoord of England.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 23 Apr 2024, 5:30 PM Last updated: Tue 23 Apr 2024, 5:46 PM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Sports Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Jonk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wim Jonk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Trampoline_and_Tumbling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Trampoline and Tumbling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=8bde790e-0d09-512d-858a-e423772c63b8&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99265&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Liverpool's typically meticulous approach hasn't aligned with the painstaking current search for a new boss. Arne Slot is the reported top candidate for the Liverpool job, with talks taking place to agree a fee with Feyenoord.\n\nGary Neville has admitted that he has been shocked by Liverpool's lack of 'precise' planning in terms of their new manager search - with the club not on their reported third target in Arne Slot.\n\nThe Reds have been preparing to bring in a new manager since Jurgen Klopp's announcement that he would be leaving the club at the end of January, and having seen Xabi Alonso's exploits at Bayer Leverkusen, it seemed for all the world that he would be next to the Anfield throne. But having announced that he would stay at Leverkusen, new targets were sought after.\n\nRuben Amorim was next, yet developments earlier in the week saw him become likely to stay at Sporting Lisbon, which has led the club to Feyenoord boss Slot. And with the managerial search dragging on, Neville can't quite believe how complicated the situation has become - as he imagined Liverpool to have \"boxed off\" their replacement for Klopp almost instantly.\n\nNeville: \"I Did Not Expect This from Liverpool\" Liverpool have usually been quick to do transfer business\n\nSpeaking on The Overlap on Thursday morning, the Manchester United legend admitted that he expected a more \"precise\" approach from the Reds, having been so exact in their recruitment in years gone by. He said:\n\n\"I didn't expect this from Liverpool. I expected them to be quite precise because six months out, Klopp has told them so that they can get the next appointment right.\n\n\"The idea of Klopp going early was so that they could plan for the end of the season, and get everything sorted. I'm thinking 'they already know who they have got'.\n\n\"I thought with Liverpool, just because how efficient they have been, I thought they would have already had it boxed off at the point where Klopp hands his notice in because they obviously already have someone locked in, and you're thinking 'Xabi Alonso is tied in'.\n\n\"That goes, and the next guy goes, and you're thinking [shrugs]. I imagined Liverpool having it boxed off.\n\n\"I thought with Alonso, if he says he'd have taken the Liverpool job in the February or March, which he would've had to have done, it would never have kept quiet. That could have derailed what is happening at Leverkusen, which to be fair is the biggest thing that could happen in his managerial career at this stage. He could not distract at winning the league away from that.\n\n\"He had to commit, not just because he wanted to stay another year, but if it was that he was leaving partway through a season where he hadn't won the league yet, he had to get that job done and get focused on that.\"\n\nArne Slot to Liverpool: Manager Search Latest Arne Slot has been fast-tracked into frontrunner for the Liverpool job\n\nThe latest reports on Slot are that Liverpool have opened negotiations with Feyenoord to secure his services after his short-yet-sweet career in Rotterdam.\n\nHaving taken over the role in 2021, Slot has already won an Eredivisie title, the Dutch Cup and dragged Feyenoord to the Europa Conference League final in 2022, where they lost to Marseille.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Liverpool won their first top-flight title in 30 years under Jurgen Klopp\n\nLiverpool have reportedly made a bid of \u00a37.75million for the 45-year-old manager, though it will cost them \u00a39m if they are to land their man, according to Sky Sports.\n\nSlot is said to tick all the key criteria for the Liverpool role, with reports in Holland suggesting that the process could move quickly with Slot keen on a move to Anfield.\n\nRelated Premier League Rule For 2024/25 Might Have Disallowed Everton Goal vs Liverpool Things will be rather different next season with the introduction of new technology - so much so that Branthwaite's goal may not have stood.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

Feyenoord won the Dutch Cup on Sunday, and though second behind PSV in the league, a 16-game unbeaten run stretching back to December means they are all-but guaranteed a place in the next season's Champions League group stages.\n\nThat had been a key reason for staying on last summer. Slot fended off interest from Leeds in early 2023 and was linked with Tottenham last spring, but with Spurs seemingly searching in the dark and having failed to qualify for Europe, the prospect was not so enticing.\n\nThe crown Klopp is vacating will be heavy - Xabi Alonso opted to stay at Bayer Leverkusen -but Slot may find this offer simply too good to refuse.\n\nSlot's 'green flags'\n\nLiverpool's hierarchy and fans alike will be craving a seamless transition, so too the players who have become ingrained in Klopp's ways on Merseyside.\n\nSomeone who can slot right in, essentially, and so no surprise then that Liverpool's data-driven search has landed them on Slot, who operates what Transfermarkt calls a defensive 4-3-3 - \"defensive\" in shape, not outlook.\n\n\"His style is high-energy attacking football in a 4-3-3 with two deep lying midfielders and a reliance on wingers to create chances,\" Football Oranje editor Michael Bell told last year.\n\n\"Slot is a Pep Guardiola-type more than a Jose Mourinho. He wants to entertain, he wants to attack and he wants his players to give it all on the pitch. He uses tight budgets, improves young players and plays nice to watch attacking football.\n\n\"He is doing all this with a good manner and is well liked by his players and the fans. All this will be green flags to any club looking at Rotterdam.\"\n\nThough likened to Guardiola, the Klopp similarities are evident too, and his reliance on wingers will inevitably put the spotlight on Mohamed Salah, who would appear to be the most likely key player to move on this summer.\n\nThat decision may be beyond Slot, or whoever takes charge, but nevertheless out wide is an area where Liverpool have flourished under Klopp - and should Salah go, it would be a position they may look to reinforce with any money they get.\n\nSlot's style in focus\n\nDefensively, Feyenoord are bettered only by league leaders PSV for fewest goals conceded this season. With four matches remaining, Feyenoord's 23 goals conceded in 30 games is on course to be an improvement on last term, when they shipped in 30 en route to winning the title.\n\nUp front, Feyenoord are again second to PSV for goals (77), while Santiago Gimenez alone has 24 goals in all competitions this season, the same amount as Salah and six more than Darwin Nunez. What odds, then, of Slot wanting to bring the promising 23-year-old Mexican along to Anfield for the ride?\n\nWhen in possession, Feyenoord are second for short passes and second bottom for long passes completed in the Eredivisie this season, per FBref, a contrast in Liverpool's style given the Premier League club's tendency to also play it long - they are third behind Fulham and Manchester City for long passes completed.\n\n\"Hoof-ball\" that is not. Liverpool's accuracy with long balls (or diagonals) for their wingers has been a tactic that has repeatedly worked under Klopp. Slot may want to adjust his own philosophy to fall in line with Liverpool's strengths, such as the precision of their defenders' passes and the pace of their wide players.\n\nFor crosses, Liverpool are second and Feyenoord fifth in their respective leagues this season, once more making out wide a key focus - although when it comes to switching play the two sides contrast once again. Liverpool are second in this regard (attempting 129 switches), with Feyenoord bottom among all Eredivisie clubs (57).\n\nThese differences hint at the subtle changes Liverpool fans may see under Slot in attack, although off the ball it should be more of the same.\n\nIn the Premier League, Liverpool are second for tackles in the attacking third and third for tackles in the middle third this season, while Feyenoord are first in both of those categories for the Eredivisie.\n\nThe high press, therefore, won't be disappearing when Klopp does.\n\nBy Mark Douglas\n\nSlot should at least have the charisma to match the impact of the departing Klopp, with one Premier League executive telling that he came away from a meeting with him \"very impressed\" by not only what he'd heard but the way the Feyenoord boss was able to articulate and sell his vision.\n\n\"It does not surprise me one bit that Premier League clubs are interested in him - he carries himself very well,\" they said. Slot's influence has been pivotal in persuading some of Feyenoord's recent signings to pick the club, even when bigger or better financial offers were elsewhere.\n\nFew other clubs demand their manager to be a leader like Liverpool. Klopp didn't just manage the Reds well, he led from the front, articulating the club's values perfectly. Slot has been backed to do the same.\n\n\"As well as being an absolutely excellent coach he's also eloquent, funny and clever. The press over here really like him - he gives straight answers and doesn't play any games. He is himself in press conferences,\" Martijn Krabbendam, Feyenoord correspondent for Voetbal International, says.\n\n\"The only doubt around him is how he copes under pressure - but that's because he has done so well at Feyenoord and AZ Alkmaar. He has not agitated to leave, I just think he wants to test his ideas and systems with world class players, which is what he will find at Liverpool.\"\n\nAny cracks in the armour?\n\nSlot would represent a gamble, but in truth very few managers wouldn't.\n\nKlopp was not \"Premier League ready\" but had impressed in the Bundesliga with Mainz and then Borussia Dortmund, and so Slot can only hope his time at AZ Alkmaar and then Feyenoord has suitably prepared him for his next challenge.\n\nBeing an affable character should certainly stand him in good stead at a club where the manager is a key representative of this fiercely passionate city, and Slot could soon learn of the many roles that come with taking charge of Liverpool Football Club.\n\nWhat will matter most, though, are results, and the ability to combine a tilt at the title with a European push.\n\nOn that front, Feyenoord fell short this season, exiting the Champions League at the group stages and then losing to Roma in the Europa League - albeit only on penalties in the knockout round play-offs.\n\nThe fact Feyenoord's title defence has also fallen short is a case of fine margins, given they have lost just two league games all season. Notably, Feyenoord could yet outscore last season's title-winning points total of 82, with 84 still possible.\n\nIt has been less of a title relinquished, therefore, and more of a title won by PSV, who have lost once in the league this season and boast a goal difference of +78 - scoring 95 times in 30 games so far and conceding just 17.\n\nSlot and Feyenoord could do little to stop this - just like Klopp and Liverpool may find in the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_hincks@inews.co.uk", "name": "Michael Hincks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voetbal_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voetbal International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

It's been suggested Slot would be keen to bring assistant Sipke Hulshoff with him to Merseyside should he succeed Klopp and Liverpool's backroom staff will be in need of a rebuild as Klopp's assistants Pep Lijnders and Peter Krawietz get set to walk away alongside elite-development coach Vitor Matos.\n\nLiverpool are keen to show Feyenoord respect throughout the process and wanted to avoid any disruption to Slot's preparation ahead of his team's successful KNVB Beker final meeting with NEC, but the pathway for negotiations has become easier to navigate since Sunday's 1-0 win at home stadium De Kuip.\n\nSlot is understood not to have a release clause in his contract with suggestions Feyenoord may be willing accept a fee of less than \u20ac10million as compensation for losing their head coach.\n\nLiverpool have a good relationship with Slot's agent, Rafaela Pimenta, the Brazilian lawyer who also looks after the interests of Manchester City striker Erling Haaland among others. Pimenta was a guest at Anfield for a Premier League game last season.\n\nWhile Slot is now an overwhelming favourite to become their next manager, the Reds are continuing to assess other targets with the deal no means a formality. It's believed Bayern Munich and Barcelona are among other clubs to have also been impressed by Slot's work in Holland.\n\nOn Tuesday, Feyenoord cancelled a regular press conference for Wednesday to preview their game at Go Ahead Eagles the following day.\n\nSlot has been in charge of the Dutch side for three seasons, reaching the Europa Conference League final in 2022 and then winning their first Eredivisie title in six years last term. Feyenoord are second in the table this campaign and at the weekend won the Dutch Cup.\n\nIt is understood Slot has become strongly fancied by the Anfield hierarchy given he fits all of the criteria that have been set out during the process of finding Klopp's replacement, which is being led by Fenway Sports Group chief executive of football Michael Edwards.\n\nFSG have known about the need for a new manager since Klopp told them of his decision to stand down back in November but the process of securing a replacement has only intensified in recent weeks with the Boston-based organisation keen to restructure the club before sourcing a successor.\n\nThat meant former sporting director Edwards was appointed last month to effectively replace Mike Gordon as the head of the club while Richard Hughes will leave his post as Bournemouth's sporting director at the end of the campaign to take up a similar position at Anfield from June 1.\n\nHe will bring with him Mark Burchill, the Cherries' chief scout, who will support Barry Hunter and Dave Fallows in the recruitment department alongside director of research Will Spearman and his team.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk",

Mail Sport reported on Tuesday how Slot had emerged as Liverpool's preferred candidate to take over from Jurgen Klopp, who has four games left at the club.\n\nLiverpool have opened negotiations with Feyenoord as they look to sign head coach Arne Slot\n\nCurrent Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the season\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/04/24/22/84002493-0-image-m-20_1713995787657.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The current Feyenoord boss is now in talks with the club over a possible move.\n\nIt has come extremely quickly for the 45-year-old after Liverpool had made Xabi Alonso their priority target. Ruben Amorim and Julien Nagelsmann were other names linked whilst Roberto De Zerbi has been on the periphery of conversations.\n\nSlot, who was close to joining Tottenham 12 months ago, has now emerged as the frontrunner to be in the Anfield dugout next season. Coming off the back of winning Eredivisie in the 2022/23 campaign, Slot won the Dutch Cup at the weekend and has built an impressive resume in his time as a manager so far.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool new manager latest as Feyenoord boss Arne Slot becomes leading contender\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool could end Nike kit partnership with Adidas 'poised' to take over\n\nHe has a track record of developing young players and has come to be the standout candidate currently in Michael Edwards' search for a new head coach. Slot only signed a new deal last year keeping him in Holland until 2026, though that may not be enough to keep Liverpool from their man.\n\nNow, with things really ramping up, Liverpool Echo has taken a look at how Slot could line up with a dream summer of transfers.\n\nThe defence is in a position to stay largely the same. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk signing new contracts with the club would be a major boost and as a period of transition after nine years goes on, Slot working with an unchanged backline will be beneficial.\n\nIbrahima Konate is a player that can form part of the next great Liverpool defence whilst Andy Robertson on the left still has plenty to offer. Finding a new full-back to support him will be a priority - perhaps someone of Antonee Robinson's style - but for now it's no change at the back.\n\nMidfield is more interesting. This was the area of most movement last summer so the places for Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szboszlai are cemented. Watauro Endo has been a splendid addition but Slot may well look to find someone of his own to go alongside them.\n\nLiverpool are all too familiar now with Atalanta's Teun Koopmeiners, but they could be in to learn more about the versatile Dutchman. He played two seasons under Slot at AZ Alkmaar, scoring 21 times in 58 games with seven assists. Capable of operating practically anywhere on the pitch, it wouldn't be a surprise to see the pair reunited at Anfield.\n\nThe frontline has been hit-and-miss for Liverpool this season but the exit of Klopp could also see the same for Mohammed Salah. If another big offer from Saudi Arabia comes then parting ways could be on the cards.\n\nLiverpool would need to replace him and here is where things get interesting. Nobody is entirely convinced of Darwin Nunez becoming a more consistent player, and someone that Slot has seen excel under his coaching is Mexican marksman Santiago Gimenez.\n\nThe 23-year-old was snapped up by Slot in 2022 and hasn't looked back since. He is reportedly a target for a host of Premier League teams and with 47 goals and 10 assists in 85 games it's easy to see why. It wouldn't be a surprise to see the Feyenoord man follow his manager to Merseyside.\n\nWho plays on the wings is a trickier one. Luis Diaz may well be ready to step up to the mantle left by Salah but he will be on the left. Diogo Jota is a versatile option across the board and currently Liverpool's best finisher but more additions could still be made.\n\nHarvey Elliot is another player ideal for depth and options but on the right there could be another signing. West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, anyone?\n\nThe 27-year-old is proven in the Premier League and would offer experience and immediate quality to the attack. He's not the glamorous name that most expect but he regularly puts up impressive numbers for a defensive Hammers side.\n\nHe only signed a new contract last year but with David Moyes possibly moving on, Bowen could look for the transfer of a lifetime himself. This squad also leaves plenty of room for rotation with Nunez and Liverpool's glowing youth.\n\nHow do you think Liverpool would line up if Slot was to join?

While Rubin Amorim and Roberto De Zerbi have been linked with the Merseyside club, it seems 45-year-old Slot is their top choice.\n\nSlot won't be short of options though, with Liverpool's sporting hierarchy, including the returning Michael Edwards and sporting director Richard Hughes, needing to make a compelling case. The Feyenoord boss is also said to be attracting interest from Bayern Munich, who will be parting ways with former Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel at the end of the season.\n\nSlot's work in the Netherlands has not gone unnoticed by Premier League clubs. The former Zwolle and Breda midfielder led Feyenoord to second place in the Europa Conference league in his first year in charge, followed by an Eredivisie title in his second year and a KNVB Cup win in 2023/24.\n\nTottenham had Slot on their shortlist last summer but he opted to stay in the Netherlands before Spurs appointed Ange Postecoglou. However, there's one figure in north London who may know Slot better than most in the Premier League, reports the Mirror.\n\nNelson has spoken highly of his time at Feyenoord under Slot, reflecting on his loan spell from the Gunners during the 2021/22 season. \"Holland was great for me,\" he said, praising the impact Slot had on his game.\n\nREAD MORE: Thomas Partey makes Arsenal title demand and sends Tottenham warning ahead of clash\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal have two hidden North London Derby motivations vs Tottenham in Premier League title race\n\n\"I felt like Arne Slot is a great manager.

I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it is an enrichment for Dutch football. He can really go anywhere: Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that.\n\n\"I hope he stays in the Netherlands, but I am convinced he can do it anywhere. I've spoken to him a few times, and he handles the players very well. Of course, he is also very well-versed tactically. I can explain his ideas well; he is calm and intelligent. As far as I am concerned, he is a top trainer.

After moving into coaching roles at Cambuur and then AZ Alkmaar, Slot stepped up into the manager's job with the latter for the 2019-20 season, which was interrupted by the Covid pandemic. AZ finished second behind Ajax on goal difference in the shortened campaign.\n\nSlot left for Feyenoord in December 2020, succeeding Dick Advocaat, and brought former Arsenal and Manchester United forward Robin van Persie onto his staff. In May 2022, Feyenoord reached the first Europa Conference League final, losing to Roma, and finished third in the Eredivisie. Slot's second season at De Kuip saw Feyenoord win the Eredivisie title - the first for the club since 2017. Earlier this month, Feyenoord beat NEC Nijmegen to lift the 2024 KNVB Cup.\n\nNo matter who eventually takes over as Liverpool's new manager, they will be expected to be able to deliver more memorable European nights at Anfield. Slot would bring plenty of that experience with him. While at AZ, Slot took his side into the Europa League - where they played Manchester United in 2019. After moving to Feyenoord, Slot guided the club to the Europa Conference League final in May 2022. Eredivisie success brought with it a crack at the Champions League for 2023-24. Despite beating Celtic and Lazio in their group, the Dutch side did not qualify for the knockout stage and then lost out to Roma in the Europa League play-off round.\n\nSlot has grown into an attack-minded coach, also with an eye on bringing through talent - plenty of which would await in Liverpool's youth ranks. Feyenoord - who sit second behind Eredivisie rivals PSV Eindhoven this season - also press high, winning plenty of tackles in the opposition's final third, and are comfortable in different formations, whether that is with one up top or a fluid 4-3-3. Slot was linked with a switch to Tottenham last summer, but the Liverpool job is expected to prove too good an opportunity for the ambitious Dutch coach to pass up.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta_Rotterdam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sparta Rotterdam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Cambuur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SC Cambuur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breda"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Breda"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwolle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_Nijmegen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NEC Nijmegen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Kuip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Kuip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Advocaat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Advocaat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Long-running favourite Xabi Alonso has committed his immediate future to Bayer Leverkusen, while Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim has been linked more firmly with West Ham in recent days.\n\nNow, well-connected Times journalist Paul Joyce reports that Slot is a \"leading candidate\" for the Liverpool job this summer. The 45-year-old Dutchman reportedly turned down Tottenham last year but is said to be open to a move to Merseyside.\n\nWant to know a bit more about him? We've compiled nine quotes - from players, coaches and journalists to the man himself - to give you an idea about the man who could be at the helm for Liverpool next season.\n\n\"Some players you can see are going to be coaches,\" Slot's former NAC Breda team-mate Edwin de Graaf told The Athletic.\n\n\"I also played with Alfred Schreuder (the former Ajax manager) and both him and Slot... nobody is surprised now they're both coaches.\n\n\"He would ask the coach why they were using certain tactics. And in the dressing room, he would talk to the group about (for example) a way of pressing or defending. He would ask: 'Why were we doing it this way? Would it be better to do it this way?'. He would make suggestions to his coaches.\n\n\"But he would do it in such a good way. He wouldn't do it with an attitude: he would ask the coach: 'What do you think about this?'. He would also very quickly see what the opponents were doing.\"\n\nREAD: Seven brilliant (and terrible) managers that have rejected the Liverpool job\n\n\"I got the impression Slot was watching FC Barcelona all day and night,\" Bert Konterman - technical manager when Slot was playing at PEC - told Dutch daily paper Algemeen Dagblad.\n\n\"He was watching the positional play, the way they took on free-kicks. When he arrived at the club the next morning, he was so excited what he had seen!\"\n\n\"I don't want to compare myself with Pep at all, but he's a control freak just like me,\" Arne Slot himself told Voetbal International.\n\n\"If I look at myself, I want to win a match during the week before kick-off. I try to imprint the chosen tactic to my players as much as I can.\n\n\"That's why I can be very frustrated when a referee even makes the slightest mistake to your disadvantage. This can have so much influence while you're not able to control anything. All preparation can be ruined because of a referee mistake. This can be my biggest frustration!\n\n\"Guardiola gives me the ultimate pleasure in football. I'd rather watch Manchester City than any other team in the world, although now I enjoy watching Napoli, Arsenal and Brighton as well.\n\n\"I don't want to compare Feyenoord with City, but we more or less play football according to the same philosophy: 4-3-3, building up from the back, wanting to put pressure on the opponent rather quickly.\n\n\"There are quite a few similarities of which I think: can I steal some of this? But I always make sure that it fits with my own players.\"\n\n\"You can't obliviously attack, attack, attack. Dutch managers like Frank de Boer and Peter Bosz were like this - Erik ten Hag wasn't and Slot isn't,\" Dutch journalist Kevin Van Nunen told TNT Sports when Slot was linked with the Tottenham vacancy last year.\n\n\"It's almost like Dutch coaches matured. Slot is a natural successor to Ten Hag as an exponent of new generation of Dutch managers. When you have a steady defence and all players know what to do, you can go on and play attacking football.\n\n\"Definitely Ajax, possibly PSV and maybe even AZ, have better individual players than Feyenoord, but they can't deliver as a team. One plus one doesn't always equal two, but at Feyenoord there's a team that equals 11 and that has been their real strength this season [2022-23].\"\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 times Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was the nicest bloke in the world\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name every Liverpool manager of the post-war era?\n\n\"Holland was great for me. I felt like Arne Slot is a great manager. He really got me into my rhythm. He gave me a lot of opportunities to play and I excelled,\" Arsenal's Reiss Nelson told the Colney Carpool podcast.\n\n\"It was really cool, like I said we got to the final. It was just the little things with the personal life, not my family around, the Corona situation. So it was a bit tough. But football-wise, it was perfect.\"\n\n\"For me, he's the best [manager I've worked under]\" former Feyenoord winger Oussama Idrissi told Dutch outlet AD.\n\n\"He can develop players and make teams play fun football.\n\n\"Slot was the best,\" Idrissi repeated when it was pointed out he's also played under the likes of Julen Lopetegui, Herve Renard and Erik ten Hag.\n\n\"He is one of the best managers I've ever seen,\" said former Brighton forward Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who currently plays under Slot at Feyenoord.\n\n\"In football terms, even the best. At the moment, he is the best in the Netherlands.\"\n\n\"He's a really good manager and sometimes it can come fast and quick,\" says Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan.\n\n\"I've followed Feyenoord for 40 years. Not since the days of Johan Cruyff at Ajax in the 1980s has there been a coach so attack-minded in the Dutch league. Cruyff only had a few disciples who followed him and one of them was Pep Guardiola.\n\n\"I would say Slot is a Guardiola-style manager based on everything I've seen over the past couple of years. The fans of Feyenoord can't believe what they've seen over that time.\"\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name the top 20 Dutch goalscorers in Premier League history?\n\n\"My next step will not be a club in Holland,\" Slot said last year.\n\n\"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\n\"What answer can I give that there will be no headlines about it? So next question,\" was Slot's curt response when asked about the Liverpool vacancy when Klopp announced his decision to step down.\n\nBut he found the time to praise the Liverpool manager: \"I think it is incredibly impressive that [Klopp] has been so good at that level for so long, with so much energy for nine years.\n\n\"I see it as a special achievement that you can maintain that level for nine years with so much dedication and passion. Especially when you consider how many games we play. Let alone how many they play in England.\"", "source": {"uri": "planetfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planet Football"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nestor_watach@planetfootball.com", "name": "Nestor Watach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Schreuder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alfred Schreuder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAC_Breda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NAC Breda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oussama_Idrissi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oussama Idrissi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Konterman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bert Konterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bosz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Bosz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algemeen_Dagblad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algemeen Dagblad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_de_Boer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank de Boer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voetbal_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voetbal International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

The midfielder spent time at PEC Zwolle, NAC Breda and Sparta Rotterdam, winning the Eerste Divisie twice in 2002 and then ten years later in 2012.\n\nThe attacking player hung up his boots in 2013, moving into the coaching department at PEC Zwolle. He perfected his craft in the club's youth system, before making the move to Cambuur to take up the role of assistant coach.\n\nIn 2017, Slot took a move to AZ Alkmaar, once again as an assistant coach. Two years later, he was appointed head coach, guiding the club through a troubled period in the Covid pandemic.\n\nWhen football resumed, Slot led his side to a second place finish in the Eredivisie, level on points with Dutch giants Ajax.\n\nHis success opened further doors and in 2021 he was offered the chance to lead Feyenoord, guiding them to the league title during his second season with the club. His achievements with Feyenoord were even more commendable as Slot charged through the league with a very young squad at his disposal.\n\nThen 22-year-old Santiago Gimenez and 25-year-old Justin Bijlow led the squad at either ends of the pitch, attracting the eyes of footballing fans everywhere.\n\nSlot has been known to use an aggressive, out of possession approach, with defenders committed to intense pressing. He relies on a willingness to create chances, with similarities to how Klopp currently sets up his squad.\n\nHis use of wingers to formulate chances very much resembles that of Klopp, who often turns to Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah to feed the central striker. The Dutchman's teams play on the front foot when it comes to attack, fighting to create chances and score goals.\n\nFeyenoord's pressing has become the most successful of any team across Europe's top seven leagues. In comparison, Feyenoord have made 722 interceptions, with Liverpool making 706 at the time of writing.\n\nThe Eredivisie side also lead the way in terms of points won from losing positions, sitting at 62 points, interestingly the same number as Liverpool.\n\nFeyenoord's boss has also been known to study Pep Guardiola's training methods, focusing on controlling through possession - a quality that Liverpool may grab with both hands.\n\nSlot's charismatic approach also draws similarities to that of the Reds' boss, often appearing engaging and smiley. Slot could bring this presence to the Premier League, stepping into the shoes that once belonged to Klopp.\n\nSlot's statistics speak for themselves, but it's impossible to ignore the fact that he has no Premier League experience, either as a player or manager.\n\nHowever, his ideologies and style will suit Liverpool tenfold, and may be their best bet of replicating the magic that Klopp has brewed at Anfield. The Reds heavily rely on a gegenpressing style of football, something that Slot has also mastered.\n\nIn order to apply pressure on teams high up the pitch, a squad needs defenders who lack fear squeezing behind their midfielders. Both Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are excellent at this, even if it means leaving space for opponents behind. Their style of play may fuse perfectly with what Slot aims to achieve, unlocking a potentially even stronger Van Dijk.\n\nSlot could be tempted to purchase an attacking midfielder, offering another option alongside Dominik Szoboszlai. This could open the door even more for Teun Koopmeiners to arrive at Anfield, continuing a relationship between himself and Slot.\n\nIt is thought that Slot is ready to take the next step in his managerial career, despite being contracted with his current team until 2026.\n\nReports state that a fee of less than \u20ac10m (\u00a38.6m) could be enough to see him leave the Dutch side, but there is no release clause in his contract, making a move significantly easier.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Last season, he helped them win the Eredivisie title for the first time since 2017.\n\nThis term, Feyenoord are second in the Eredivisie table but they have won the KNVB Cup.

Ahead of this game, he was approached by Cotterill, who was perhaps overly keen to get a comment about his proposed move to Liverpool in what Sky Sports describe on their website as an 'awkward exchange'.\n\nCotterill greeted Slot by saying: \"You're in the news.\"\n\nTo which, a smiling Slot responded: \"I am.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Premier League winners and losers... Arsenal, Fernandes, Mateta amazing but Chelsea and Liverpool shocking\n\n\"You said you wanted to go to the Premier League. Is it a possibility?\" the head coach was asked.\n\n\"But tonight we are playing Go Ahead Eagles,\" Slot bluntly responded.\n\nCotterill then offered his good luck wishes and Slot thanked him as the pair went their separate ways.\n\nCotterill's Sky Sports colleague - journalist Melissa Reddy - has offered an update on Liverpool's pursuit of Slot, who could finalise a deal \"very quickly\".\n\n\"Talks continue between Feyenoord and Liverpool over compensation for Arne Slot to become Jurgen Klopp's successor,\" Reddy said on Sky Sports reporter.\n\nREAD MORE: Mailbox...

While Feyenoord would ideally like to keep him, they understand they can't block such a massive opportunity for him. So, their interest is in getting the best possible deal for him.\n\n\"Sources over in Holland are telling us it could move very, very quickly because of Slot's determination to take the job.\"", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lewis_oldham@football365.com", "name": "Lewis Oldham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Ahead_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Go Ahead Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F04%2F25163705%2FArne-Slot-Liverpool-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Dutch Cup on Sunday after leading Feyenoord to their first league championship in six years the previous season.\n\nA year ago, before ruling himself out of the running, he was the clear favorite to take over at Tottenham.\n\nAccording to reports from Sky Sports, the BBC, and The Times, Slot is currently in the lead for the coveted position of succeeding Klopp at Anfield.\n\nHowever, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, who are also seeking for new coaches for the upcoming campaign, may present a challenge to the Reds.\n\nWhen Klopp stated in January that he would step down at the end of the season after almost nine years in the position, Xabi Alonso, the manager of Bayer Leverkusen and a former player for Liverpool, was the front-runner.\n\nAlonso, though, has made the decision to remain at Leverkusen after helping the team win their first-ever Bundesliga championship.\n\nRuben Amorim, the coach of Sporting Lisbon, was apparently in discussions with West Ham on Monday on the possibility of taking David Moyes' job at Liverpool, but he was also linked to the position.\n\nAfter making an impression in his first managerial position at AZ Alkmaar, Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021.\n\nAt the end of his first season, he guided the Dutch giants to their first-ever Europa Conference League final, where they were defeated by Jose Mourinho's Roma by a close margin.\n\nSlot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.\n\nThe Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nKlopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.\n\nLiverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand.", "source": {"uri": "opinionnigeria.com", "dataType":

But my intention is to stay because that already raises an expectation.\"\n\nHowever, with Liverpool now almost certain to be playing with Europe's elite next season, the Champions League won't be an issue for the Reds should they decide Slot is the man.\n\nLooking at his track record, you can see why Liverpool are so impressed by the Dutchman.\n\nSlot enjoyed a relatively quiet career as a player, spending the majority of his time with FC Zwolle before retiring in 2013.\n\nHe immediately became a youth coach at Zwolle before joining SC Cambuur as assistant manager, where he remained until moving to AZ Alkmaar.\n\nSlot was the club's assistant for two years but became the first-team boss in the summer of 2019.\n\nHis Alkmaar team were prolific, scoring 118 goals in 58 matches, while he helped the club qualify for the Europa League.\n\nHe also boasted the highest win ratio in the club's history, but he was sacked surprisingly in 2020 due to Alkmaar's belief he'd lost focus on the job amid links with Feyenoord.\n\nOf course, he ended up at Feyenoord less than a year later, and the rest is history.\n\nThey won the Eredivisie last season and won the KNVB Cup this year to hand Slot his first pieces of silverware.\n\nThe 45-year-old has been compared to Pep Guardiola by Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan, who said: \"He's a really good manager and sometimes it can come fast and quick.\n\n\"I've followed Feyenoord for 40 years. Not since the days of Johan Cruyff at Ajax in the 1980s has there been a coach so attack-minded in the Dutch league. Cruyff only had a few disciples who followed him, and one of them was Pep Guardiola.\n\n\"I would say Slot is a Guardiola-style manager based on everything I've seen over the past couple of years. The fans of Feyenoord can't believe what they've seen over that time.\"\n\nOf course, the key thing for Liverpool fans is the style of play, and Slot likes to entertain.\n\nSpeaking to UEFA about his brand of football, he said: \"We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity.\n\n\"When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nIn many ways, this is exactly how Klopp and Guardiola play, so the transition should be straightforward for Liverpool fans and players.\n\nSlot and Atletico boss Diego Simeone found themselves in a shoving match - after a friendly in 2021.\n\nIt was a lost in translation moment when Simeone thought Slot was trying to wind him after Feyenoord's 2-1 win.\n\n\"At that moment, at the end of the match, I turned to Simeone to tell him how passionate he was even in a friendly match,\" he said ahead of the team's Champions League clash in 2023.\n\n\"Then, he misinterpreted the smile I had at that moment and pushed me. This says a lot about him, how easily he gets irritated and frustrated. It doesn't matter who he is in front of, he is like that, I don't think he has anything against me.\"\n\nAway from the field, he is a huge rap fan - at least his daughter is, having taken her to see Dutch rapper Jonna Fraser in Amsterdam.\n\nHe'll be in good hands with members of the squad such as John Aldridge, who performed the 1988 hit 'Anfield Rap', still knocking about.\n\nThe Reds have other options to become their new manager, but the more you learn about Slot, it seems like a perfect fit.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors":

His reign will come to an end this summer though, in a move the German boss announced in January.\n\nSlot is the current favourite to replace him, with Xabi Alonso having ruled himself out and Ruben Amorim pausing talks. Liverpool chiefs have already opened discussions with Feyenoord over Slot's future.\n\nThe Dutchman has impressed in his native Netherlands, leading Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title last season and the KNVB Cup this year. But former Liverpool star Ryan Babel has warned Slot it will not be smooth sailing if Slot takes over a Anfield.\n\n\"Apart from Klopp, I understand that at least forty more people within the club are leaving. From kitchen people to staff and analysts. A trainer who comes has to replace that, and that doesn't seem easy to me,\" Babel told VoetbalPrimeur.\n\nBabel later clarified that the people set to leave had been brought to Anfield by Klopp. And while he did not name Slot specifically, his comments clearly serve as a warning to the Dutchman.\n\nHe tweeted: \"Any manager having the desire to take the #LFC job has to know that it has to bring more than just a coaching staff to the club. More than 30 people behind the scenes who Klopp brought in, who were a MAJOR part of #LFC success over the years are leaving too. Tough job.\"\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Is Arne Slot the right choice by Liverpool? Comment below.\n\nFormer Liverpool star Ryan Babel believes as many as 40 members of staff will exit alongside Jurgen Klopp\n\nBabel is not the only former Liverpool star to be concerned about Slot taking over. Reds legend Jamie Carragher has warned that moving to Anfield from Feyenoord will be a 'huge jump' for Slot to handle.\n\n\"What I would say from Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump and I think it shows in this moment a lack of real top managers out there when you look at who Liverpool were going for. Initially probably Xabi Alonso but it was only his first full season as a manager,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"There was talk of Amorin from Sporting Lisbon but he's only 39. Now Arne Slot looks like he is the favourite right now. I don't think it's like Rafa Benitez coming on or Jurgen Klopp coming in. Benitez came off the back of winning two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup.\n\n\"Jurgen Klopp coming after winning a couple of titles with Borussia Dortmund and getting to a Champions League final. Liverpool were in a different space then, and that was a Liverpool team under Rafa Benitez that I was part of that was trying to qualify for the top four.\n\n\"The same with Jurgen Klopp when he came in. Liverpool are in a different area now and fancy themselves to challenge for the Premier League next season and the Champions League, they will be expected to reach the quarter-finals at least. I think it is a huge jump, he's obviously a great coach and has a good track record with the clubs he has had so far, so we will see.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nSomething that may have edged Liverpool in the direction of Slot over Ruben Amorim, is the fact that the Portuguese manager would potentially have to act more in the transfer market to ensure the squad suits his three-at-the-back system.\n\nWhile Xabi Alonso and Amorim have similar attacking principles to Klopp, Slot sticking with a definite four in defence allows for a smoother transition.\n\nLiverpool managers need to be good communicators and have a strong relationship with supporters. Also, modern football often requires managers to be sympathetic towards their players, a trait Slot shares with Klopp.\n\n\"He can be angry with his players, of course,\" Dennis van Eersel, of Dutch national TV channel RTV, explained. \"But he also puts his arm around them. They like him because he's built a harmony at the club.\"\n\nThe Dutchman already has a good grasp of English, something that seemingly ruled Internazionale boss Simone Inzaghi out of the running earlyon.", "source": {"uri": "thisisanfield.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "This Is Anfield"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_millne@thisisanfield.com", "name": "Sam Millne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voetbal_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voetbal International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Inzaghi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Inzaghi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-design-7-11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 1329, "textEnd": 1336, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Reports have suggested that the Reds are ready to move for the current Feyenoord boss after being left frustrated in their pursuits of Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim.\n\nIt is not the first time that Slot has been linked with a Premier League switch. Ahead of appointing Ange Postecoglou, it was reported that Tottenham were interested in his services.\n\nThe North London side even went so far as to table an offer to Slot. However, he rejected the chance to move, with managing in the Champions League as one of his key demands.\n\n\"The decisive factor was playing the Champions League,\" the 44-year-old revealed. \"The fantastic work with the staff and the players, the fact that I'm having a great time privately and being able to build on the past two seasons.\n\n\"I didn't know what would happen [with Tottenham]. weighed everything up, including whether the people who work with me would want to come with me.

Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\nAs it stands, Liverpool could match Slot's demands for a spot in the Champions League next season. The Reds currently sit second in the Premier League and 14 points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham.\n\nTwo wins from their next five games would guarantee Liverpool returning to the top table of European football next term. They are unlikely to be satisfied with that given the Reds could also realistically secure a second Premier League title under Klopp before the end of the season.\n\nElsewhere, Slot could potentially be reunited with Feyenoord next season. The Dutch side are also on the verge of booking their Champions League spot. Slot's side sit second in the Eredivisie but 12 points clear of Twente with four matches of the campaign remaining.\n\nSlot, 45, has two years remaining on his contract in Rotterdam. It has been suggested that it would take \u00a38.59million for Liverpool to buy him out of that deal.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The buzz around Slot stepping into Klopp's shoes cranked up a notch on Tuesday, when he was tipped as the top pick for the job.\n\nWith the rumour mill in full swing about his next career move, Slot has now addressed the Liverpool link head-on. His squad is gearing up for a clash against Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch league this Thursday (April 25) and he'd just hopped off the team coach when questioned over a move to Merseyside.\n\nREAD MORE: Virgil van Dijk opens up on fellow Dutchman Arne Slot's credentials for Liverpool job\n\nREAD MORE: What Arne Slot is really like - from stars who played under possible next Liverpool boss\n\nSky Sports' Gary Cotterill threw the big question at him. The reporter said \"you're in the news,\" prompting 45-year-old Slot to acknowledge: \"I am, I can't deny that.\"\n\nCotterill didn't let up, probing further about the possibility of Slot taking charge at Anfield next term. Slot kept his cards close to his chest but responded \"tonight we are playing Go Ahead Eagles,\" before he strolled into the team's lodgings, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nDo you think Arne Slot would be a good fit at Liverpool? Let us know in the comments section below\n\nThe ECHO has learned that Slot is highly respected by Liverpool top brass as they continue their hunt for a new manager. Michael Edwards, the CEO of football at Fenway Sports Group, is spearheading the process to find Klopp's replacement, which has been in progress for several months.\n\nAfter numerous roles as a youth coach and an assistant, Slot received his first top job with AZ Alkmaar in 2019. He came close to an improbable title triumph with the Dutch minnows in his first season - in March 2020 they were level on points with Ajax in the Eredivisie and second only on goal difference, but the season was abandoned and cancelled due to the pandemic.\n\nHe left Alkmaar midway through the following season, when he was sacked following speculation he was set to join Feyenoord. He took up the reins in Rotterdam in the summer of 2021 and proved a revelation, restoring the once faltering side to their former glory.\n\nSlot took them to the Europa Conference League final, missing out on gold to Jose Mourinho's Roma, and finished third in the Eredivisie in his first season. The next year he won the league title, Feyenoord's first since 2017, and then claimed the KNVB Cup earlier this year, with his team currently second in the league.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Ahead_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Go Ahead Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The ECHO understands that Slot has emerged as a leading contender for the job and that Liverpool have opened negotiations with Feyenoord.\n\nSlot led Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title last season, the club's first since 2017, and has claimed the KNVB Cup this term. The 45-year-old coach was touted with the Tottenham Hotspur job last summer and Europan football expert Andy Brassell has spoken about Slot's suitability to become Liverpool manager, including his past successes and willingness to develop teams.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool legend was found 'safe and well' after reunion absence sparked bizarre online search\n\nREAD MORE: Jurgen Klopp shares surprise at 'over the top' Everton and Liverpool reaction he wants\n\n\"I think if you look at Feyenoord's points total and the way they've played, in any normal season they are winning the league again but PSV have been absolutely outstanding. They have won the Dutch Cup and this is a guy who has got a consistent record of success and playing attacking football over a number of years,\" Brassell told Sky Sports News, reflecting on Slot's domestic record.\n\n\"In the Covid season, in 2019/20, he could have easily won the league with AZ [Alkmaar] had the league not been brought to an abrupt halt.\"\n\nIn terms of working with Liverpool's squad, Brassell believes that Slot's playing style would not be a wild departure from Klopp's current tactics. The journalist added that Slot developed a rivalry with former Liverpool nemesis Jose Mourinho, with Feyenoord coming up against his Roma side in each of the last three seasons, including the 2022 Europa Conference League final.\n\n\"I think that the idea of developing teams and working with younger players as well is something that really chimes with Liverpool at the moment,\" he explained. \"I think the way he wants to attack is something that would really appeal to Liverpool fans. Someone who wants his teams to always find a way to put pressure on the opposition, to press to score goals. They do that in Europe as well.\"\n\n\"No one is quite like Klopp in front of the media but Slot is no shrinking violet at all,\" Brassell added. \"We've seen this in those Roma games when he's come face-to-face with Jose Mourinho, upset him, and not backed down.\"\n\nThere would be understandable question marks regarding whether Slot could achieve the same level of success, moving across from the Eredivisie to the Premier League. However, Brassell insists that somewhat inevitable comparisons to Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag would be wide of the mark.\n\n\"Premier League clubs have known he would fit here well for quite a while. The Premier League has moved towards possession and being on the front-foot so it's probably the right time,\" Brassell continued.\n\n\"Of course, there's a gap [between the Eredivisie and the Premier League] but it's different to being a player because he will have better players at his disposal. If you look at Erik ten Hag, something that's never really talked about, Ajax had a tonne of defensive problems in his last six months.\n\n\"Even when Erik ten Hag was doing pretty well with Manchester United last year, in some of the defeats they really bottomed out, particularly defensively, so it suggests that some of those issues are something he hasn't really worked on.\n\n\"Whereas, Feyenoord have pretty much the best defensive record in the Eredivisie and they have done over the last two seasons.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_bayliss@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Jake Bayliss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Sean Dyche's men inflicted a near-fatal blow to their arch rivals' dream of lifting the Premier League title in J\u00fcrgen Klopp's final season at Anfield. The German manager announced his decision to step down in January to recharge his batteries and take a one-year sabbatical from football.\n\nLiverpool were still strongly in contention to win four trophies when Klopp made his announcement but it now looks incredibly likely that the League Cup will be their only silverware this season. With Liverpool's title prospects hanging by a thread, attention has switched to Klopp's replacement at Anfield. Xabi Alonso was their first choice but the Spaniard committed his future to Bayer Leverkusen for another season and Arne Slot has now emerged as the favourite. It's understood that talks have commenced between the Feyenoord manager's representatives and Liverpool's hierarchy. We've taken a closer look at Slot's managerial history and style with fantastic insight from Transfermarkt's Eredivisie experts.\n\nThe reports of Slot being Liverpool's preferred candidate has split opinion amongst supporters who originally had their hearts set on Alonso returning to Anfield. Fittingly, Slot ended Ajax's dominance in the Eredivisie by winning the title with Feyenoord last season after Erik ten Hag departed for Manchester United. Feyenoord, however, endured a difficult start to this season and PSV can secure the title this evening with a win over Heerenveen. It's difficult to avoid comparisons between Slot and Ten Hag given the jobs they undertook in the Eredivisie and Kevin Lux, Transfermarkt's Area Manager for the Netherlands, admits similarities exist.\n\n\"It is always hard to say if a manager from the Eredivisie is a good fit in the Premier League, same as for players,\" Lux said. \"Look at Erik ten Hag, who was brilliant at Ajax, but doesn't seem to get United on track again. Liverpool is an even harder task in my opinion, because the new manager has to succeed a club icon in Klopp. In many ways, Slot could be called the new Ten Hag, because he made a Dutch team into a team that did well in Europe. He made the Conference League final two years ago and played well in the Europa League a year later. Just like Ten Hag at Ajax, Slot had to replace his most important players every year and every year, he succeeded in building a competitive team very quickly. It was bad luck that he had an impossible to beat PSV in the Eredivisie this year, otherwise, he would have been champions again this year.\"\n\nWhile Ten Hag's debut season in England was ultimately successful after leading Man United to their first silverware in six years and a third-place finish, it's been a difficult second campaign. United are languishing in sixth place and their tactical plan has been severely criticised. Replacing Klopp is widely viewed as an unenviable task given the transformation he's overseen at Liverpool but Lux believes Slot will bring \"fun\" to Anfield - if he's afforded time. \"I'm curious to see how he does when he has to perform in the best league in the world at one of the best clubs in the world. When he started at Feyenoord, there was no pressure whatsoever, so when he managed to get them back in contention, he was the instant hero in Rotterdam. That was the reason he got away with a relatively slow start this season. Liverpool probably doesn't give him that time and luxury. But when he gets the time he needs to build his own team, I am confident Liverpool will have a lot of fun with Slot.\"\n\nNow in only his fifth season as a senior head coach, 44-year-old Slot has taken football in the Netherlands by storm and has quickly established himself as one of the most promising coaches in all of European football. Following youth and first team coaching roles at PEC Zwolle and Cambuur, Slot was hired by AZ Alkmaar as the club's assistant coach in 2017 and then went on to step up to the main job in 2019. And in no time at all, the Bergentheim-born tactician got to work on turning the Dutch club around. After finishing fourth the previous year, Slot took the club to second place, missing out on the top spot by little more than goal difference in a campaign that was cut short due to the COVID pandemic.\n\nAnd before long Feyenoord had come calling for the young manager. Tasked with replacing Dick Advocaat and building a squad that could improve on being the best of the rest in Dutch football, Slot hit the ground running immediately and guided Feyenoord to a third-place finish in his first season before winning the title in his second season with a second-place finish likely this season. \"Arne Slot embodies the new generation of Dutch managers,\" notes Kevin Lux, Transfermarkt's content manager in the Netherlands. \"Together with Erik ten Hag, he has shown to be able to transform underdogs into contenders, both at AZ and now Feyenoord. He knows how to give his teams a tactical advantage and players he works with show incredible improvement.\"\n\nThere's little doubt that Slot's success in Dutch football is clear for all to see on paper, but what kind of football do his teams actually play? \"One of the key components is that all of his teams are extremely fit,\" says Lux, when asked about the Slot style of football. \"Slot lets his team play in an organised, attacking way. There is a lot of movement on the midfield and on the wings, which makes it hard to defend.

No official reason was given.\n\nSlot is likely to bring his right-hand man Sipke Hulshoff to his next club, with Liverpool needing a mass rebuild in the coaching department after a number of high-profile members of Klopp's trusted team set to follow him out of the exit door.\n\nKlopp announced in late January he would leave the club after nearly nine years at the helm and he now has just five matches remaining on Merseyside, including Wednesday's trip across Stanley Park to Everton and Goodison Park.\n\nThe 45-year-old recently won the KNVB Cup and previously won the Eredivisie in 2022-23\n\nInitial reports suggested that the Reds were considering a move for Xabi Alonso, who has done such outstanding work with Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nBut Alonso wanted to stay in Germany and that led to Ruben Amorim assuming bookmakers favouritism.\n\nThe Portuguese, who has \u00a312million release clause in his contract, spoke recently about not being able to give Sporting Lisbon any

He is currently working as the head coach of Eredivisie side Feyenoord. He started out his career in football as a midfielder who played for teams like FC Zwolle, NAC Breda, and Sparta Rotterdam before retiring as a player following a return at PEC Zwolle.\n\nHe is married to Miriam and that he has children and his children are believed to be in secondary school.\n\nArne Slot is of Dutch nationality.\n\nArne Slot is currently 45 years old and stands at a height of 1.84 m (6 ft).\n\nPrior to becoming a manager, Arne Slot was a professional footballer who spent his entire playing career in the Netherlands. After retiring, he chose a path in management and first managed AZ Alkmaar from 2019-2020 and now manages Feyenoord.\n\nSlot led the club to a Europa Conference League final in his first season at the club and has already led them to an Eredivisie title in his second year. And during his third season, he helped them win the KNVB Cup. Just last summer, he was a strong candidate to take over at Tottenham.\n\nArne Slot usually prefers to play a fluid 4-2-3-1 formation described as \"a high-energy attacking football in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 with two deep-lying midfielders and a reliance on wingers to create chances.\"\n\nArne Slot has managed Feyenoord ever since 2021/22 and the team currently boasts the best defensive record in the Eredivisie. Feyenoord have conceded just 23 goals in 30 games, and also have the record of the second-most goals scored (77). While explaining his approach with Feyenoord, Slot shared:\n\nWe are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity.\n\nWhen we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nArne likes to trust in his youth and has a good man-management skills. Despite being a senior manager for just five years, he has already drawn comparisons to Marcelo Bielsa's style. The 45-year-old likes to play his full-backs high up the pitch with his centre-backs simultaneously moving wider.\n\nLiverpool are a big club and cannot have just any manager leading the club. However, by the looks of things, Arne could have the qualities of a top manager. Sky Sports have previously described him as \"engaging, polite, very smiley, he's got presence and charisma; and he's funny.\" While possessing all these characteristics, he can also be stern and strict with his players.\n\nMoreover, despite his Dutch background, he can speak fluent English, and has previously expressed interest in joining the Premier League. He said in an interview:\n\nMy next step will not be a club in Holland.\n\nIf that is my next step, then I've failed completely. The normal next step will be to go abroad and I've always said the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta_Rotterdam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sparta Rotterdam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAC_Breda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NAC Breda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/liverpool.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 1635, "textEnd": 1642, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-", "textStart": 534, "textEnd": 546}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Slot has impressed during his time at Feyenoord, guiding them to the Eredivisie title last season and a KNVB Cup triumph this year.\n\nHe was a contender for the Tottenham job before Ange Postecoglou took over last summer and admitted he was interested in a move to the Premier League. \"The next step will not be another club in Holland,\" he said.\n\n\"If that is the next step, I've failed completely in the upcoming few years. A normal next step would be to go abroad and I've always said that the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, it would cost Liverpool \u00a38.59m in compensation to appoint the Dutchman as he is under contract until 2026, having signed an extension last summer after deciding against a move to Spurs.\n\nHowever, Slot is also the subject of interest from Bayern Munich as they search for Thomas Tuchel's replacement. He is one of several contenders for the job, alongside De Zerbi and Ralf Rangnick.\n\nAnd Dutch legend Marco van Basten believes Slot has what it takes to be a success outside the Netherlands. \"I think Slot is really good. I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it is an enrichment for Dutch football,\" Van Basten said.\n\nArne Slot is also attracting interest from Bayern Munich\n\n\"He can really go anywhere: Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that. I hope he stays in the Netherlands, but I am convinced he can do it anywhere. I've spoken to him a few times, and he handles the players very well.\n\n\"Of course, he is also very well-versed tactically. I can explain his ideas well; he is calm and intelligent. As far as I am concerned, he is a top trainer. I really think he can go to any club, even difficult clubs.

Slot was heavily linked with a possible move to Tottenham Hotspur last year, but opted to stay at Feyenoord and signed a contract extension with the Dutch side until 2026.\n\nReports added that Liverpool will have to pay an undisclosed sum to Feyenoord for Slot's services. He has been widely praised for his innovative, attacking football with Feyenoord, winning the league title in the 2022-23 season, as well as the KNVB Cup on Sunday.\n\nIn his first season at Feyenoord, he also led the Rotterdam club to the final of the inaugural Europa Conference League. Slot, who was a journeyman midfielder as a player, began his coaching career at AZ Alkmaar, first as an assistant under John van den Brom, and then head coach from 2019-20.\n\nEarlier this week, Feyenoord CEO Dennis te Kloese responded to questions over Slot's future in an interview with ESPN, saying: \"We assume that he will also be our trainer next year. \"We have experienced this situation before and will take good care of our own interests.\"\n\nReuters has contacted Liverpool for comment. Liverpool were linked with a move for their former player and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso earlier this year, but the Spaniard opted to commit his future to the Bundesliga champions.\n\nSporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also among the names linked with the top job at Liverpool. Klopp announced in January that he would stand down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season.\n\nThe German joined the club in October 2015 and has won the Champions League, Premier League, Club World Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and Super Cup, as well as the Community Shield. In his final campaign, Liverpool have won the League Cup and remain in contention for the Premier League title. Liverpool sit second in the standings with 74 points from 33 matches, three behind leaders Arsenal but with a game in hand.\n\nThey visit local rivals Everton in a league match later on Wednesday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algemeen_Dagblad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algemeen Dagblad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Super Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Community_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Community Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/images/sports/soccer-2.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-10-", "textStart": 2153, "textEnd": 2165}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

They're currently second and about to relinquish their crown, but given the frankly remarkable form of table-toppers PSV this season, that's nothing to be sniffed at.\n\nEnglish clubs have tried to nab Slot before, with the 45-year-old turning down both Tottenham and Leeds last year. Known for his eye-catching football style and a knack for nurturing young talent, Slot could be a perfect fit at Anfield.

We know who it is not. As well as Amorim, Gary O'Neil was today named as someone who is not under consideration by FSG.\n\nIn the meantime, Roberto De Zerbi has already long since been ruled out, too.\n\nSo, if it isn't to be Slot, we await to see the surprise name brought forward.

His teams have consistently played attractive football and competed with rivals with even bigger budgets. He improves players and gives youngsters a chance. He is funny, likeable and charismatic.\n\nBut to match Klopp's achievements, Slot will have to do better than any of his compatriots, including Ten Hag.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_van_Polen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bram van Polen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwolle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Cambuur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SC Cambuur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Advocaat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Advocaat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Simeone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diego Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Sinisterra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Sinisterra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Senesi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcos Senesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_de_Boer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank de Boer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The only question would be how quickly he could adapt to A) the Premier League and B) managing a massive club of Liverpool's size.\n\nREAD MORE: Six players could benefit if Arne Slot replaces J\u00fcrgen Klopp amid Liverpool next manager latest\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot already had say on J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Liverpool and hinted at next move\n\nThese are the four things that Liverpool.com believes will 'definitely' happen if Slot does take over at Anfield. He is a leading option for the club, and a very interesting one at that.\n\nFormation decision made\n\nAt the moment, Slot plays with a double pivot in midfield as part of a 4-2-3-1 system. But that would not necessarily have to remain the same if he were to move to Liverpool.\n\nThe Dutch coach likes broadly similar things from his team to what Klopp does and he could easily adapt his ideas to more of a 4-3-3 formation. With Liverpool having so many good midfield options, that might make more sense.\n\nInevitable transfer links\n\nLiverpool might want to strengthen in a couple of places this summer and it will not be signing anyone based only on the manager who comes in. If it is R\u00faben Amorim, that won't mean an influx of Sporting CP players. Likewise, Slot coming in will not mean a sudden arrival of Feyenoord stars.\n\nThe links, though, are inevitable. Dirk Kuyt, speaking to the ECHO, has previously suggested that Liverpool should sign Lutsharel Geertruida and Orkun K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc, though the latter has already moved to Benfica.\n\nStyle of play evolves again\n\nSlot and Klopp both like a high-pressing, high-energy way of playing. The counter-press is king when it comes to playmaking and ensuring that their sides win the ball back high upfield.\n\nBut Liverpool cannot exclusively use that method. Most teams in the Premier League sit back and defend against the Reds and that is something that Slot would have to get used to quickly. He would have more than enough quality at his disposal to be able to do that, though, and it would be particularly interesting what plan he might have for Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nXabi Alonso and R\u00faben Amorim comparisons\n\nBefore Slot's name emerged, Xabi Alonso and then R\u00faben Amorim both appealed to Liverpool fans. Alonso, in particular, would have been a shoo-in for getting fans onside but he opted to stay with Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nWhoever comes in at Liverpool -- Slot or someone else entirely -- will face inevitable comparisons not just to Klopp but to the others that Reds supporters wanted to see installed as head coach. The new appointment will need to be their own person, however.\n\nTrying to be a version of Klopp would never go well. Get a few positive results early on, though, and play an exciting brand of football, with this exciting group of Liverpool players, there is a real chance to build on what is left behind.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_addison@liverpool.com", "name": "Matt Addison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Amorim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Amorim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkun_K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orkun K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Kuyt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Kuyt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Listen on Spotify, Apple or anywhere you get your podcasts\n\nIn the tunnel of the Stadio Olimpico, Jose Mourinho was breathing fire and looking for the man who had got under his skin.\n\nMourinho's Roma side had just beaten Feyenoord on penalties to reach the quarter-finals of Europa League, last February, but he was in no mood to be gracious. The Portuguese Man of War had a score to settle with Arne Slot and was determined to say his piece.\n\nSlot, the man who is expected to become Liverpool's next king, had lit the blue touch paper in a pre-match press conference. The first leg between the sides had ended in a 1-1 draw and ahead of the return, Slot was asked if he had watched any of Roma's recent games to learn about them.\n\nWith a wry smile, Slot replied he'd seen \"one or two\" but made it clear his idea of learning was watching Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. His style of football and views on how fluently the game should be played are closely aligned with the Catalan's, not the prosaic functionality of Mourinho.\n\nBeing the man that he is, Mourinho was never going to let it lie.\n\nFeyenoord manager Arne Slot is the man expected to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool this summer\n\nJurgen Klopp has just five games left as Liverpool manager before he ends a near nine year stay at the club\n\nSlot led Feyenoord to only their second Eredivisie title in 24 years last season\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Listen to our EXCLUSIVE interview with Phil Foden IAKO! - Nottingham Forest are making fools of themselves!

Play on Apple Spotify\n\n'Hey!' he shouted when seeing Slot milling around outside his dressing room. 'Maybe you should have watched those games - you might know what it takes to be a winner!'\n\nIf only he had kept his mouth closed. Three months later, Slot had turned Feyenoord into Champions of The Netherland for just the second time in the 21st century, their charge to the title seeing them rack up 11 straight wins after that trip to Rome.\n\nThe significance of the triumph should not be underestimated. There are three huge clubs in The Netherlands but Feyenoord had for long been the poor relation of Ajax and PSV Eindhoven, until Slot brought them back to the summit. Does that narrative sound familiar?\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot's hefty compensation fee revealed as Liverpool consider move for Feyenoord boss to replace Jurgen Klopp Advertisement\n\nTo stand any chance of succeeding Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's next manager will require a certain character and Slot, evidently, will not be found wanting when it comes to standing up for himself or saying it how he sees it. In many respects, he is similar in that way to the German.\n\nBut the next man in charge at Anfield is also going to have to win matches - and lots of them - to prevent a post-Klopp hangover from creeping in and there is reason to believe that Slot will do that: one thing for certain is that there won't be any Mourinho conservativism.\n\nTwo weeks before that game in Rome, Feyenood had played in a KNVB cup tie at home to NEC Nijmegen. Those in the De Kuip stadium had been left flabbergasted by what they had seen from Slot's team in terms of relentless attacking.\n\nRemarkably, over 120 minutes, Feyenoord had 50 shots on goal, 27 of which were on target. There were 17 corners, an avalanche of possession. Somehow the game finished 4-4 - NEC converted four of their six chances on the counter - but the hosts' progressed via a penalty shootout.\n\nIt wasn't so much the result that was notable that night, more how Feyenoord had played. Afterwards, phones were buzzing amongst the Rotterdam hierarchy that they felt they had their own version of Guardiola. They also knew that his progress was not going to go unnoticed.\n\nAround that time, Leeds were keen to recruit him and their former Director of Football Victor Orta flew into Rotterdam to see if he could do a deal. Feyenoord were never going to entertain, nor was Slot - a married father to a son and daughter - who had grander ambitions than Elland Road.\n\nThe significance of the triumph should not be underestimated, considering how far Feyenoord's stock has fallen in recent years\n\nFeyenoord claimed the KNVB Cup last weekend after a 1-0 win over NEC Nijmegen\n\nQuinten Timber, twin brother of Arsenal defender Justin, has flourished under Slot's guidance\n\nOpportunities presented themselves again last summer. He could have gone to Tottenham, he could have even gone to Chelsea but such was Feyenoord's commitment to keeping him, Chairman Toon van Bodegom rewarded him with the biggest contract ever given to a manager in The Netherlands.\n\nNobody had been put on deal of \u00a35million a year but Slot, they were adamant, was worth every penny. He backed up their faith again this season, delivering the KNVB Cup last Sunday with a 1-0 win over NEC Nijmegen - a far more controlled affair than their previous meeting.\n\nSlot has a bond with his players - Quinten Timber, twin brother of Arsenal defender Justin, has flourished under his guidance, as has Slovakian defender David Hancko - that stems from his commitment to improvement every single day.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool close in on Arne Slot as their next manager with talks developing quickly to take over from Jurgen Klopp - and deal for Dutchman could even be concluded by THIS WEEKEND Advertisement\n\n'Feyenoord players always say: \"Everything the trainer predicted, we saw in the game\",' says one Rotterdam-based source. 'Arne is a workaholic. He's also happy to work with staff and delegate. He has a coach for this, a coach for that, and for that and that and that!\n\n'They have to feed him with information and then he makes his tactical plan. Feyenoord and Ajax have the biggest fanbases but Slot brought them back to the top. There was Luis Sinisterrra who didn't work out at first and everyone wanted to give up on him.\n\n'I don't know what Slot did but all of a sudden, he was filling his potential. He went to Leeds for \u00a325m, one of Feyenoord's biggest sales ever. Before Slot he could have gone for a nickel and dime! He puts belief in players. He rebuilt the club when best players left.'\n\nCritics will argue that Slot's team trail PSV in the title race this time around but the irony is they have more points than at this stage 12 months ago and recently obliterated Ajax 6-0: PSV, for their part, have been like a runaway train, with just one defeat and one draw.\n\nAll this has been noted by Liverpool. The key requisites for Klopp's replacement was that he had to develop players, be able to build a connection with fans and have a commitment to the club's style of play and he ticks all the boxes.\n\nIt would be wrong to bill as Klopp 2:0 but it is easy to see parallels in their respective careers in that they started out at good solid, clubs - for Mainz and Klopp, read AZ Alkmaar and Slot - before going to be grander stages.\n\nSlot, really, could have won the title with AZ but his time there ended in frustration, with the club's top brass telling him on Saturday morning he had to leave immediately after it became clear he was not going to sign another contract, amid interest from Feyenoord.\n\nSlot's ability to connect with his players has been noted as one of his key strengths\n\nFeyenoord humiliated their old rivals Ajax by beating them 6-0 in Rotterdam earlier this month\n\n'As a club, we have chosen to say goodbye immediately,\" director of football Max Huiberts said in a statement on the club's website. 'We want to have a head coach leading the team who is fully focused on AZ.' The manner of that departure still rankles Slot.\n\nHow will it end in Rotterdam? That remains to be seen but the end, seemingly, could happen very soon. Liverpool made contact with Feyenoord on Wednesday morning and the intention is for getting the deal done as quickly as possible, once a compensation package can be resolved.\n\nThen Slot will be clear to start a new chapter, for him and for his new club. One thing is for certain: as shown with the episode with Mourinho, he won't shy away from the fight.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_Nijmegen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NEC Nijmegen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

There has been no progress or approach from Liverpool for the Sporting manager.\n\nBrighton's De Zerbi is another name on Liverpool's list, but Slot is now firmly in contention, reports the Mirror. Slot led Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title last season and clinched the Dutch Cup this term by defeating NEC on Sunday.\n\nWho do you think will be the next Liverpool manager? Let us know in the comment section below\n\nThey are currently trailing leaders PSV by nine points in this season's title race with just four games remaining, meaning they will likely surrender their Eredivisie crown. Feyenoord also bowed out of the Champions League group stage and got knocked out by Roma in the Europa League.\n\nLast summer, Arne Slot was hot on Tottenham's radar before he decided to stick with the Dutch scene, leaving Spurs to snap up Ange Postecoglou. Now, Dutch footie icon Marco van Basten has thrown his weight behind Slot, tipping him for greatness beyond the Netherlands.\n\nVan Basten has been singing Slot's praises, saying: \"I think Slot is really good. I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it is an enrichment for Dutch football. He can really go anywhere: Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that.\"\n\nThe Dutch maestro continued to wax lyrical about Slot, adding: \"I hope he stays in the Netherlands, but I am convinced he can do it anywhere. I've spoken to him a few times, and he handles the players very well. Of course, he is also very well-versed tactically. I can explain his ideas well; he is calm and intelligent. As far as I am concerned, he is a top trainer. I really think he can go to any club, even difficult clubs. He is very smart in his choice of words.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mckenna@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Chris

But he is not the only candidate for the potential vacancy even though Dutch sources are already briefing that he would be the clear frontrunner for the job.\n\nRobin van Persie, who currently coaches Feyenoord's U18 side, is not thought to be in the running for the De Kuip hot-seat, should it become available.\n\nThe former Arsenal and Manchester United striker is instead close to taking his first senior managerial role with Heerenveen. Feyenoord have held talks with the ex-Netherlands frontman over possibly taking over their U21 side next season but discussions have so far failed to bear fruit.\n\nAnd coaching novice Van Persie is understood to favour the prospect of sharpening his tools elsewhere before taking a high-pressure job despite his own personal desire to manage Feyenoord's first-team in the future. Slot's agent Rafaela Pimenta is expected to hold talks over her client's future with Feyenoord imminently as speculation intensifies.\n\nArne Slot is now the frontrunner to replace Jurgen Klopp\n\nWhile Liverpool are yet to register their interest directly with the Dutch giants, reports suggest they have already held at least one meeting with Slot to discuss the vacancy. If successful, Slot would be keen to bring his current assistant boss Sipke Hulshoff with him to Merseyside as part of a new-look coaching setup.\n\nThe Feyenoord manager was due to address the media on Wednesday ahead of his current side's fixture against Go Ahead Eagles on Thursday but the press conference was cancelled, though club sources insist the decision had already been made before Liverpool's interest was made public.\n\nMeanwhile, Sporting CP head coach Ruben Amorim is no longer in the running after the Portuguese boss flew to London on Monday for talks with West Ham. Barring a drastic U-turn, Amorim is not expected to take up either position next season, though he has also attracted interest from elsewhere.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

The managerial market is a busy one, with Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Liverpool all searching in the same pool of candidates and plenty could change between now and the summer.\n\nBut Slot appears to be a good fit for Liverpool due to his playing style and coaching philosophy, which echoes the Klopp playbook. \"We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity,\" he told UEFA of his style with Feyenoord. \"When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nSlot came close to taking over at Tottenham last May, but they could not agree a financial package with Feyenoord and ended up with Ange Postecoglou instead. The 45-year-old Dutchman doesn't just fit theoretically, he has also won trophies, claiming the Eredivisie title last season and the Dutch Cup this term.\n\nBut what might his arrival upon Merseyside mean for the Liverpool team? Gazing into our crystal ball, Mirror Football has pondered that very question.\n\nFirst thing's first, Slot's formation is clear: a 4-2-3-1 in possession, which can be flexible to accommodate attacking talent. He played it with AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord and wouldn't need to change much at Liverpool, who play in a similar 4-3-3 formation under Klopp.\n\nLiverpool's backline has been disrupted by injuries this season, with Alisson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson all spending time on the sidelines, but - if fully fit - they are likely to continue as the first-choices next season, alongside Virgil van Dijk.\n\nLiverpool already known Teun Koopmeiners well\n\nIt is further forward where changes could be made. To play a 4-2-3-1 formation, Slot would perhaps like to sign an attacking midfielder, because other than Dominik Szoboszlai, the Liverpool squad is lacking a player capable. That could give Slot the excuse for a reunion with Teun Koopmeiners, who Liverpool know all too well.\n\nKoopmeiners has enjoyed an exceptional season with Atalanta and was part of the side which stunned the Reds with a 3-0 win at Anfield. The 26-year-old has 11 goals and four assists in Serie A so far this season and has played primarily as an attacking midfielder. Slot is a known fan, having coached him during the 2019/20 campaign at AZ Alkmaar.\n\nAnother player Slot is a huge fan of is Santiago Gimenez - the Feyenoord striker who has 24 goals and seven assists in 40 games this season. The 23-year-old has already been talked up as a potential transfer target across Europe this summer and could follow his current boss to Anfield. Darwin Nunez has enjoyed a fruitful season, but his erratic finishing and Diogo Jota's injury problems means a new striker could be beneficial this summer.\n\nA possible Liverpool XI under Arne Slot\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! What changes would you like to see at Liverpool this summer? Comment below.\n\nThat brings us to the elephant in the room: Mohamed Salah. The Liverpool icon is under contract until June 2025, but the lure of Saudi Arabian riches has not gone away and is sure to rear its head again in the summer transfer window.\n\nLiverpool are sure to want to keep Salah, who is showing few signs of slowing down at 31, but they are not in a particularly strong position. They will either need to sell for the highest fee, secure him to a fresh contract, or risk losing him for nothing next summer. So, how about replacements?\n\nBoth West Ham's Jarrod Bowen and Wolves ' Pedro Neto have frequently been linked with Liverpool - and both remain targets. With Michael Edwards back on board with Fenway Sports Group and Richard Hughes coming in as the new sporting director, the Reds won't be short of scouting expertise - but both of these players are known quantities. Neto has struggled with injuries this season and Bowen has shown a real eye for goal in 2023/24, netting 19 times in all competitions, so he gets the nod.\n\nLiverpool's possible XI under Arne Slot (4-2-3-1): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Koopmeiners; Bowen, Diaz, Gimenez\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Reds and Feyenoord are in talks over a deal to see the Dutchman take over at Anfield next season.\n\nSlot has become the front-runner after Xabi Alonso and R\u00faben Amorim were previously heavily linked with the unenviable job of replacing Klopp. And Carragher believes there is a notable \"lack of real top managers\" available to his former club.\n\nHe raised some concerns over Slot needing to make a \"huge jump\" to be a success - and that is largely due to the job Klopp has done making it a vastly different job opportunity than it was when the German first took over back in 2015.\n\nREAD MORE:Arne Slot sent Liverpool message by managerial rival Reds don't want\n\nREAD MORE:Virgil van Dijk has already raved about assistant Arne Slot could bring with him to Liverpool\n\nCarragher said on Sky Sports ahead of Liverpool's clash with Everton at Goodison Park: \"What I would say from Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump, and I think it shows in this moment a lack of real top managers out there when you look at who Liverpool were going for.\n\n\"Initially probably Xabi Alonso but it was only his first full season as a manager. There was talk of Amorin from Sporting Lisbon but he's only 39. Now Arne Slot looks like he is the favourite right now.\n\n\"I don't think it's like Rafa Benitez coming in or Jurgen Klopp coming in. Benitez came off the back of winning two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup and Jurgen Klopp coming after winning a couple of titles with Borussia Dortmund and getting to a Champions League final.\n\n\"Liverpool were in a different space then, and that was a Liverpool team under Rafa Benitez that I was part of that was trying to qualify for the top four, the same with Jurgen Klopp when he came in. Liverpool are in a different area now and fancy themselves to challenge for the Premier League next season and the Champions League, they will be expected to reach the quarter-finals at least.\n\n\"I think it is a huge jump, he's obviously a great coach and has a good track record with the clubs he has had so far, so we will see.\"\n\nWhile Carragher has some concerns, his former teammate, Sander Westerveld, believes Slot is a \"perfect fit\" for his former club. Westerveld, who played alongside Slot at Sparta Rotterdam, told Sky Sports: \"Well, first of all, I hope something happens very quickly, because I've been giving interviews about Xabi Alonso, how good he was, and last week it was all about the Portuguese (Ruben Amorim).\n\n\"Now it's Arne Slot, and in fact I played for him when I played for Sparta Rotterdam.

The German made it known earlier this year that he'd be leaving before the end of his contract following a successful spell on Merseyside - with attention turning to who may replace him.\n\nLiverpool have considered household names and upcoming managers during their search. Slot is now near the front of the queue following his exploits with Feyenoord, where he's claimed the Eredivisie title and the Dutch Cup.\n\nSlot though didn't want to add any fuel to the fire when he was asked about the prospect of moving to the Premier League to succeed Klopp at Anfield several months ago. He said: \"What answer can I give that there will be no headlines about it? So next question!\"\n\nEnglish clubs have pursued Dutch coaches in the past - Manchester United doing so recently with Erik ten Hag. The 45-year-old is highly thought of, hence why he was on the radar of Tottenham when they were looking for a new manager, before eventually staying where he was.\n\nAt the time he was being linked with the north Londoners, he said: \"The next step will not be another club in Holland. If that is the next step, I've failed completely in the upcoming few years. A normal next step would be to go abroad and I've always said that the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nFeyenoord have only lost twice in the league this term, but are second to PSV. In the Champions League, they finished third but were knocked out immediately in the Europa League.\n\nThe Dutchman has claimed several honours with Feyenoord\n\nDespite the interest in Slot the club's technical director Dennis te Kloese believes he will still be in Rotterdam next season. He said: \"I think it is logical that he is in such a good position. It is very special how he has manifested himself in recent years and has really given Feyenoord a face. We responded by extending his contract. In any case, we assume that he will also be our trainer next year. We have experienced this situation before and will take good care of our own interests.\"\n\nWhen Klopp first announced his departure Xabi Alonso was tipped to be his replacement, but the Spaniard has won the Bundesliga title and pledged his loyalty to Bayer Leverkusen. Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi is another man to be linked with the role.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

His agent Branislav Jasurek revealed in January that talks had been held with the Reds and PSG.\n\nThat move didn't materialize but he told TN that Feyenoord may be willing him this summer for a significant profit, with Hancko valued at around $48m (\u00a339m/\u20ac45m). He added \"It would have to be one of the big clubs. He will not go from Feyenoord, who is going to play in the Champions League, to a club in the bottom half of the Premier League.\"\n\nHancko needn't worry about that if Liverpool is to reignite its interest. At just 26, he appears a great option for the Reds and has the ability to play in central defense or at left-back. Liverpool is likely to seek at least one reinforcement this summer with Jo\u00ebl Matip expected to depart on a free transfer.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_prenderville@liverpool.com", "name": "Liam Prenderville", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Amorim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Amorim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00e1vid_Hancko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D\u00e1vid Hancko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_\u0160krtel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin \u0160krtel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u00ebl_Matip", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u00ebl Matip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/article29052707.ece/alternates/s1200/0_gettyimages-1705972874.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

We are left asking who succeeds the German tactician after he transformed Liverpool from a club looking from the outside to arguably England's finest.\n\nBetMGM sign-up offer: Get \u00a340 in free bets when you bet \u00a310\n\nNot signed up to BetMGM yet?

Alonso, who guided Bayer Leverkusen to a first Bundesliga title and breaking Bayern Munich's relentless 11-year monopoly, has decided to remain in Germany, overseeing the club's forthcoming Champions League campaign.\n\nAnother potential candidate, R\u00faben Amorim, could end up at West Ham after potentially guiding Sporting CP to a second Portuguese championship in three seasons. Amorim's present deal in Lisbon expires this summer, which cannot be said for Slot, who is set to remain at the Rotterdam giants until June 2026 after extending his contract last year following heavy coverage of succeeding Antonio Conte as Tottenham's full-time head coach.\n\nHowever, despite staying, Van Basten feels Slot -- linked with the vacant Anfield job -- is ready to leave the Netherlands and can set up at several European powerhouses, including Liverpool.\n\n\"I think Slot is really good. I hope he stays in the Netherlands longer because it enriches Dutch football,\" he told Ziggo Sport.\n\n\"He can really go anywhere: Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm convinced of that. I hope he stays in the Netherlands, but I am convinced he can do it anywhere. I've spoken to him a few times, and he handles the players very well. Of course, he is also very well-versed tactically.\n\n\"I can explain his ideas well; he is calm and intelligent. He is a top trainer. I think he can go to any club, even difficult clubs. He is very smart in his choice of words.\"\n\nA returning Michael Edwards will undertake the search for Klopp's replacement. Having worked as Liverpool's sporting director between 2016 and 2022 and returned earlier this year as their chief executive of football.\n\nEdwards, renowned for utilising a cutting-edge team of data analysts and scouts, could raise an eyebrow when looking at Slot's numbers.\n\nFor one, when looking across Europe's top seven leagues since Arne Slot took charge of Feyenoord in July 2021, there are two Klopp-esque metrics he matches or is in the ballpark of. The first concerns the most possession won in the final third: Feyenoord boasts 722, with Liverpool not far behind with 706. Secondly, when it comes to most points from losing positions, both teams are level (62).\n\nThat is not to say Slot is a Klopp regen. From a tactical perspective, he's a 4-2-3-1 guy, with Klopp (ironically) opting for an orthodox 4-3-3, which Dutch coaches often favour.\n\nOnce concluding a modest, nearly two-decade playing career, the former midfielder was soon appointed Cambuur interim manager before AZ gave him a full-time deal. One season in Alkmaar was enough to convince Feyenoord, and Slot would quickly turn their fortunes around. Building on a third-placed finish, Slot ended the club's six-year championship drought, and he's likely to claim a runners-up spot this season after winning the club's 14th Dutch Cup.\n\nWhoever takes over from Klopp would represent a huge gamble, but the next manager will inherit a battle-hardened squad with the right combination of youth and experience. The former speaks to a coach of Slot's calibre. The native of Bergentheim can be described as a 'teacher', someone best suited to a squad needing guidance. One could argue Liverpool post-Klopp requires a 'people's manager' who can deal with a more experienced group of players.\n\n\"I really think it is the perfect moment for a new manager and not the wrong one because we didn't win everything, we left spaces,\" Klopp said last month.\n\n\"Go at City after Pep Guardiola and you need to be champion 10 years in a row to achieve the same! Maybe it was good for that reason that we didn't become champion with 97 points.\n\n\"The people here are different. The people gave Bill Shankly the chance, and what came after Bill Shankly, and they are all bigger than we are, and the people will understand in the end that this was a fantastic time and we all enjoyed it like hell.\"", "source": {"uri": "squawka.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Squawka"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mohamed_moallim@squawka.com", "name": "Mohamed Moallim", "type": "author",

But I read and hear that it is far from complete. We shall see. We will focus on that next season, but that is still a long way off.\"\n\nIn the past, Slot has been credited with improving young players. And after he reached the Europa Conference League final in 2023, former Feyenoord loanee Reiss Nelson praised the Dutchman.\n\n\"Holland was great for me. I felt like Arne Slot is a great manager,\" he said. \"He really got me into my rhythm.

I think we are a team that is difficult to beat\".\n\nDespite nearly securing a spot at Tottenham last May, disagreements over financial terms with Feyenoord resulted in the appointment of Ange Postecoglou. Besides his theoretical fit, the 45-year-old Dutchman boasts trophy-winning records - he bagged the Eredivisie title last season and clinched the Dutch Cup this term.\n\nShould Mohamed Salah be sold by Liverpool this summer? Give us your thoughts in the comments section below\n\nSpeculating his potential transition to Merseyside, Daily Star Sport takes a dive into what his arrival could imply for Liverpool's team. Firstly, Slot's formation is clear: a 4-2-3-1 in possession, which can be flexible to accommodate attacking talent.\n\nHe played it with AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord and wouldn't need to change much at Liverpool, who play in a similar 4-3-3 formation under Klopp.\n\nLiverpool's backline has been disrupted by injuries this season, with Alisson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson all spending time on the sidelines, but if fully fit they are likely to continue as the first-choices next season, alongside Virgil van Dijk.\n\nIt is further forward where changes could be made. To play a 4-2-3-1 formation, Slot would perhaps like to sign an attacking midfielder, because other than Dominik Szoboszlai, the Liverpool squad is lacking a player capable.\n\nThat could give Slot the excuse for a reunion with Teun Koopmeiners, who Liverpool know all too well. Koopmeiners has enjoyed an exceptional season with Atalanta and was part of the side which stunned the Reds with a 3-0 win at Anfield earlier this month.\n\nThe 26-year-old has 11 goals and four assists in Serie A so far this season and has played primarily as an attacking midfielder. Slot is a known fan, having coached him during the 2019/20 campaign at AZ Alkmaar.\n\nSlot is also a massive admirer of Santiago Gimenez, the Feyenoord striker who has netted 24 goals and provided seven assists in 40 games this season. The 23-year-old is already being touted as a potential transfer target across Europe this summer and could follow his current boss to Anfield.\n\nDarwin Nunez has had a successful season, but his inconsistent finishing and Diogo Jota's injury woes suggest a new striker might be a good addition this summer.\n\nThis brings us to the big issue: Mohamed Salah. The Liverpool legend is contracted until June 2025, but the allure of Saudi Arabian wealth hasn't disappeared and is likely to resurface in the summer transfer window.\n\nLiverpool will undoubtedly want to retain Salah, who shows little sign of slowing down at 31 years of age, but they're not in a particularly strong position. They'll either need to sell for the highest price, tie him down to a new contract, or risk losing him for free next summer.\n\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen and Wolves' Pedro Neto have been frequently linked with Liverpool and both remain targets. With Michael Edwards back on board with Fenway Sports Group and Richard Hughes coming in as the new sporting director, the Reds won't be short of scouting expertise but both of these players are known quantities.\n\nNeto has struggled with injuries this season and Bowen has shown a real eye for goal in 2023/24, netting 19 times in all competitions, so he gets the nod.\n\nLiverpool's possible XI under Arne Slot (4-2-3-1): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson; Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Koopmeiners; Bowen, Diaz, Gimenez.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType":

Dutch journalist describes what worries him about Arne Slot moving to Liverpool", "body": "At this moment in time, it looks very likely that Arne Slot will be Liverpool's next manager, but according to one journalist, it could be a 'risk' for the Reds.\n\nA little over 24 hours ago, few Liverpool fans will have been an expert on Arne Slot. The 45-year-old Dutchman has become the frontrunner for the Liverpool job seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nBut with the latest developments surrounding his situation, it now seems very likely that Slot will be Jurgen Klopp's successor.\n\nLiverpool have clearly made their choice and are now looking to accelerate the deal to get things wrapped up, before any other team swoops in ahead of them.\n\nClearly Slot's move is not just a major topic in Liverpool circles at the moment but also back home in the Netherlands.\n\nSlot has developed an affable reputation in his homeland. He is highly regarded for the work he has done at Feyenoord and AZ Alkmaar.\n\nBoth clubs' supporters adored him during his stints. His demeanour and playing style appeals to fans, and that will make him a popular figure at Liverpool.\n\nAlthough there is no denying his appointment would come with some risks. Dutch journalist Sjoerd Mossou has highlighted this as well.\n\n\"It seems great to me: Arne Slot at Liverpool. Wonderful, we would like to follow that.\" Mossou said on the podcast Algameen Dagblad.\n\n\"I do believe that you can work in an excellent organization at Liverpool. That is a club where every coach wants to work. I especially wonder whether they would dare to do it, with a trainer of Slot's stature, with a trainer that no one knows.\n\n\"That has been done before in the past, and has often proven to be a good choice, but it has also failed sometimes. There is certainly a risk when you take a trainer who comes from the middle bracket of Europe.\n\n\"He can vary and he is able to adapt and pivot matches. If you analyze Slot down to the last decimal point, and what he has done with this material, because let's not forget, they are of course good players by Dutch standards, but they are not European top, then we can conclude that he is a good trainer is. But that seems pretty crazy to me. The question is more: how high is he on everyone's list?\"\n\nMichael Edwards and the data team will have done their research. Slot clearly seems to be their favoured candidate.\n\nBut there are so many variables that data cannot account for. The reality is nobody would have been a guaranteed success to come in after Jurgen Klopp.\n\nAny manager would have been a risk, given the current market. Even Xabi Alonso, who would have been many peoples' favoured candidate.\n\nYou just got to have faith it works out. There is definitely great potential in Slot. If he can get things right, this could be another really entertaining period for Liverpool.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decimal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/04/GettyImages-2147987580-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Just ask Dutch legend Marco van Basten, who has been hugely impressed with his work.\n\n\"I think he is that good,\" the former striker told Rondo, a Dutch talk show on Ziggo Sport. \"He could end up anywhere. Bayern Munich, Liverpool, you name it. I'm convinced of that.\"\n\nLiverpool could well be that club, as Slot has impressed them with his attacking blend of football, constantly pressing opponents high up the field -- reminiscent of the football played at Anfield under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nJust like the German manager, Slot is prepared to take that approach against anyone. A telling example was Feyenoord's Champions League match at Atletico Madrid earlier this season.\n\nTheir intensity helped them achieve seven shots on target, a total last bettered by a visiting side against Atletico in the Champions League when Real Madrid managed eight in 2015, according to Opta.\n\nThis season was Feyenoord's first Champions League campaign in six years, but they excelled in winning the ball high up the pitch, resulting in dangerous situations.\n\nIn their six group matches, they won the ball back 59 times in the last 40 metres of the pitch in open play, with only four teams doing that more often.\n\nSlot's teams play well in possession, and his players overlap to provide an extra layer of unpredictability. \"I've spoken to him a few times and what he does and what he sees is very good,\" explains Van Basten. \"He gets on with the squad very well, is tactically very astute, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent.\n\n\"I think he can go to any club, yes. Even to the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent.\"\n\nApart from his tactical expertise and meticulous preparations, Slot is also good at building a team with modest resources.\n\nSeven players who started the 2022 Europa Conference League final defeat by Roma left Feyenoord that summer. Slot, though, built a team with recruits such as Santiago Gimenez, Sebastian Szymanski and Mats Wieffer - all for nominal fees - who would prove pivotal in securing a first Dutch title in six years.\n\nLast summer, again, they lost important players in Szymanski and Orkun Kokcu, but have had a strong season once more, winning the Dutch Cup last Sunday.\n\nFeyenoord spent around \u00a330m on players in each of the past two campaigns, whereas Ajax have had an outlay of almost \u00a3100m in each of theirs. On top of that, Slot gives young talent a chance.\n\nQuinten Timber -- twin brother of Arsenal's Jurrien -- and Quilindschy Hartman have developed very well under his tutelage and become pillars of the team, with both making their debut for the Dutch national team this season as well.\n\nSlot is inspired by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, studying every small detail.\n\n\"I certainly don't want to compare myself to Pep, but he is a control freak just like me,\" Slot said in an interview with Voetbal International in May 2023.\n\n\"If I look at myself, I try to win a match in the week before it is played, by conveying the training, pre-match team talks and tactics to the players as perfectly as possible.\"\n\nHe said previously watching Guardiola's teams gives him the \"ultimate joy in football\". \"There is no team in the world I would rather watch than Manchester City, followed by Napoli, Arsenal and Brighton,\" added Slot.\n\n\"But City - and again it is not my intention to compare us with them - have a similar style of play to how we want to play with Feyenoord: 4-3-3, building up from the back, wanting to apply pressure quickly.\"\n\nLast season, Leeds and Crystal Palace were said to be interested and Tottenham were very keen on his services, but Slot opted to stay in the Netherlands, where he had just won the title and was looking ahead to guiding Feyenoord in the Champions League. Van Basten doesn't think a move to the Premier League would be a step too high.\n\n\"If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play (good) football, you will also get the big clubs to play good football,\" says Van Basten.\n\n\"I think it would only become easier for him because you have better players who understand quicker what you want. Those players are also more stubborn, but I think Slot is smart enough to manage that.\"\n\nArne Slot led Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title in 2022-23\n\nThe Dutchman has a calm and balanced approach, which works well with his players and was highlighted in one of his post-match dressing room talks last season.\n\nAfter Feyenoord beat rivals Ajax for the first time away in the league in 17 seasons, a video released by the club showed Slot talking about the importance of the weeks to come.\n\n\"Because this is only a win. It's not more than a win, it's a big win, but it's not more than a win,\" said Slot in the video. \"We have a bigger goal this season than only winning for the first time in 17 years in Amsterdam. Our goal is bigger than that.\"\n\nFeyenoord duly went on to clinch the league title.\n\nThis year they are in good form again and could even get a higher points tally than last season's 82, but PSV's impressive form means they will probably have to settle for second, which would still guarantee Champions League football.\n\nNow Slot could be set to embrace another rivalry, this time with a manager he so admires in Guardiola. The Dutch boss would say bring it on.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilindschy_Hartman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quilindschy Hartman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Wieffer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mats Wieffer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinten_Timber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quinten Timber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The 45-year-old Dutchman is Liverpool's favourite candidate to succeed Jurgen Klopp.\n\nBarring a last-minute change in circumstances, it would be a surprise if Slot wasn't appointed by Liverpool. Although, we have seen that happen recently, not just in the club's managerial pursuit but with the transfers of Moises Caicedo as well.\n\nSlot is an interesting character. He is well liked in the Netherlands and has enjoyed a lot of success at Feyenoord. It will be tough to follow in Klopp's footsteps, though.\n\nBut the reality is replacing Klopp was going to be a really tough task for any manager. Slot with his affable character seems like he has the mentality to make the step-up.\n\nAlthough, naturally, there will be question marks about whether he is truly ready to take on the challenge at Anfield.\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports on Wednesday night, Jamie Carragher voiced those concerns about Slot.\n\n\"What I would say is that I think from Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump,\" Carragher said.\n\n\"I think it shows that at this moment there is a dearth of real top managers out there when you actually look at who Liverpool are going for, someone initially like Xabi Alonso, who is only in his first full season as a manager.\n\n\"There was talk of Amorim from Sporting Lisbon, again he's 39. And now Arne Slot looks like he's the favourite right now. So, yeah I don't think it's like Rafa Benitez or Jurgen Klopp coming in, when Rafa Benitez came on the back of winning two La Liga titles, or Jurgen Klopp coming in winning a couple of league titles with Borussia Dortmund, next to a Champions League final.\n\n\"And Liverpool were actually in a different space then. That was a Liverpool team, certainly with Rafa Benitez that I was part of. We were trying to qualify for the top four, same with Jurgen Klopp when he came on.\n\n\"But Liverpool as I said they're in a different area now, they're actually fancying themselves to challenge in the Premier League every season and next season's Champions League, they expect to go to the quarter-finals at least.\n\n\"So I think it's a huge jump but obviously a great coach, got a great track record with the clubs that he had so far, with AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord, but yeah we'll see.\"\n\nCarragher is right to have some doubts about Slot taking over from Jurgen Klopp. However, there is a lot to admire about the Dutchman as well.\n\nHe's a more innovative coach with fresh ideas, and he's got a great character as well. When you are looking at the current managerial market, there are few out there who play with a great brand of attacking football and who have the character that he does as well.\n\nSo, all in all, he might just be Klopp's perfect replacement.

Feyenoord's Arne Slot may not be the most glamorous name in the European game but his credentials could make him an intriguing proposition for the powers that be at Anfield.\n\nSince the current incumbent in the L4 hotseat announced his intentions to depart his post at the end of the season, the lack of tangible movement in terms of his successor has seen a cloud of uncertainty drift over proceedings on Merseyside. However, supporters may finally have now edged closer to the clarity they so crave over who will assume the reins next.\n\nBayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso had appeared the obvious candidate until he decided to commit his future to the recently-crowned German champion. Even as speculation still swirls that Sporting's R\u00faben Amorim could be installed as Klopp's successor, the latest link with apparent newly-installed frontrunner Arne Slot may spell the beginning of the end of the saga.\n\nREAD MORE: How good is Arne Slot? Feyenoord record assessed for leading next Liverpool manager candidate\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Arne Slot? 'Leading candidate' to be next Liverpool manager is 'like Pep Guardiola'\n\nSlot is under consideration and is among the leading candidates. An Eredivisie title winner, he certainly ticks one box in terms of his credentials when it comes to overseeing domestic league success.\n\nMoreover, with the current Liverpool roster very much shaped in the image of Klopp, Reds fans will be encouraged to learn that they will see a lot of similarities in how Slot sets up his teams to the current manager. Here at Liverpool.com, we have compiled together a summary of what to expect from Slot, with a focus on his tactics, philosophy, and his personality...\n\nFormation\n\nPreviously the head coach at AZ Alkmaar, the current Feyenoord boss has garnered a reputation in his homeland for his high-intensity, attacking teams, which he normally sets up in a 4-2-3-1 formation. Although this is a slight variation on what Klopp has gone with during his eight seasons at Liverpool, the use of the box midfield with a defensive midfielder has been deployed by the German for the majority of this term.\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold often stepping into the midfield as a quarterback of sorts, he has evolved to become an auxiliary midfielder from his regular berth at right-back. Usually, this means that the club vice-captain has had Wataru End\u014d or Alexis Mac Allister sitting in the No. 6 role to allow him the freedom to influence the attack.\n\nMoreover, Slot's usage of wingers to try and engineer chances certainly does seem to fit with the philosophy employed by Klopp, who normally uses Luis D\u00edaz and Mohamed Salah to feed a central striker. Having taken over from Dick Advocaat with the team having finished in fifth place in the previous campaign, Feyenoord was crowned champion within two seasons using this approach. In short, the i has described his approach as \"high-energy attacking football in a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 with two deep-lying midfielders and a reliance on wingers to create chances\".\n\nPhilosophy\n\nAs for his general philosophy, Slot's teams often are comfortable dominating possession, while playing on the front foot in terms of the attack. In a word, Slot's teams have been characterized by their intensity. The statistics back this up too, with the current Dutch champion very similar in terms of its approach and mentality to what one has come to expect from Liverpool.\n\nIn fact, since Slot took over at Feyenoord, its pressing has been the most successful of any team across the continent's top seven leagues, with the Rotterdam club outperforming only Liverpool in this respect with 722 interceptions to 706. Moreover, Feyenoord lead the way in terms of points won from losing positions with 62 -- coincidentally, level with the Reds.\n\nSpeaking previously to UEFA, the current De Kuip helmsman said: \"We are an attack-minded team that likes to have a lot of the ball, and we play with a lot of intensity. When we don't have the ball, we want to win it back as quickly as possible by being aggressive and pressing to win back possession. I think we are a team that is difficult to beat.\"\n\nLikewise, a tactical analysis from Coaches Voice, stated that the coach does not \"overcommit to the high press,\" while reverting \"into a more reserved block\" if they fail to win the ball.\n\nPersonality\n\nAs for Slot's personality, there are even more parallels to be drawn with the departing Liverpool manager, with the Dutchman known for his bubbly and amusing outlook. According to a previous Sky Sports profile he is known for being \"engaging, polite, very smiley\", while he also boasts \"presence and charisma,\" while being \"funny\".\n\nHowever, he does also seem to have the ability to pull rank with his troops if they are in need of a reminder of the standards expected. Dennis van Eersel, of Dutch national TV channel RTV, previously said of Slot: \"He can be angry with his players, of course but he also puts his arm around them.

With things now reportedly set to 'move fast,' it really looks like the Reds have found their man.\n\nFor Liverpool fans, there will be mixed emotions no doubt. Finding a successor for Jurgen really brings it home once again that the big man is really leaving. And although he's obviously a talented coach, there are perhaps some concerns that the step up will be too big for Slot.\n\nJust as it has been for Klopp, it will be vital that his replacement has a good coaching team around him. Pep Lijnders has been crucial to everything good about Liverpool in recent years and by the sounds of things, Slot has has his very own Lijnders lined up.\n\nKlopp's entire first-team staff have always been influential to everything he's achieved at Liverpool. It will be strange to see many of them leave the club with him.\n\nBut, with the new man coming in, it's important that he brings people with him who can help him to succeed.\n\nAnd with that in mind, Slot is reportedly already preparing to assemble his team for the Reds.\n\nTaking to X last night, journalist Dominic King claimed that the Dutchman will look to bring his current assistant manager at Feyenoord, Sipke Hulshoff, with him.\n\n\"Arne Slot update: he would be prepared to bring his assistant Sipike Hulshoff with him to Liverpool if the move deal gets done,\" King reports. \"It is absolutely clear now Slot is preferred candidate at this stage.\"\n\nPlenty of Liverpool supporters may not have even heard of Slot before the last couple of days, so they won't be expected to know his assistant either.\n\nBut, as it turns out, some at Anfield are already very aware of Hulshoff. The 49-year-old combines his duties at Feyenoord with also being Ronald Koeman's assistant for the Netherlands national team.\n\nObviously, there he will have come into contact with Liverpool's Dutch trio of Cody Gakpo, Ryan Gravenberch and - more importantly - captain Virgil van Dijk. Van Dijk has publicly praised Hulshoff in the past, raving about his tactical strength to Voetbal International last year.\n\n\"Of course, I didn't know Sipke Hulshoff at all before this,\" says the Liverpool captain. \"You have to get to know each other. You can see what his qualities are and I personally like that. Hopefully he can continue that. He is very clear and tactically strong. I like the moments when he leads a training session. I think I also speak on behalf of the group. We're only four days in, but it's a good start.\"\n\nKnowing the captain will surely be a big boost for Hulshoff is he does indeed come in.

It doesn't look a million miles away.\n\nSince the news of Slot's ascension broke on Tuesday, plenty of pundits have been weighing in on how he will fare at Liverpool, including Jamie Carragher. So far, much of the tone has been slightly sceptical, and Reds legend Steve Nicol now follows that same view.\n\nSuch is Klopp's status at Liverpool, that it was always going to be a difficult job for whoever follows him at Anfield.\n\nAs a result, the incoming manager needs to have an incredibly strong personality. Slot appears to tick that box - as well as plenty of others.\n\nBut according to Nicol, while the Dutchman may be well equipped in some ways to handle Liverpool, his limited coaching experience makes him a big gamble.\n\n\"Underwhelmed,\" the 62-year-old told ESPN when asked for his response to Slot being installed as top candidate.\n\n\"I mean, is that the resume of somebody to lead Liverpool back to the Premier League title and the Champions League?

Despite setting up in the same 4-2-3-1 shape, he has at times included an extra player, pressing high with a front three - both man for man against a back three or against a back four.\"\n\nShould he take charge at Anfield, Slot is likely to utilise his tactic of a double pivot in midfield, playing in front of a back four with attacking full-backs.\n\nAlisson would almost certainly keep his place in goal, while Liverpool's record-breaking full-back duo of Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold likely start on the flanks.\n\nReds captain Virgil van Dijk would start in central defence, possibly alongside Ibrahima Konate.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister, arguably the club's player of the season, would start as one of the two holding midfielders - potentially alongside a new No 6 signing - Mats Wieffer.\n\nThe versatile Dutchman has previously been linked with Liverpool and could be a potential bargain, having scored six goals in 42 games for Feyenoord this season.\n\nIn the 4-2-3-1 formation, Dominik Szoboszlai would be pushed forward into the No 10 role.\n\nCody Gakpo could get the nod over Luis Diaz on the left, given Slot's familiarity with him from their time against each other in the Eredivisie, while Salah would likely play on the right if he still remains at Anfield next season.\n\nDarwin Nunez could get the nod over injury-prone Diogo Jota up front, although Slot may look to sign a more reliable striker if he joins the Premier League club -

Slot's side has a 12-point margin to third with four games to play, so is more or less guaranteed to end the season as runner-up.\n\nREAD MORE: Four things 'definitely' happen if Liverpool hires Arne Slot including transfers and formation\n\nREAD MORE: Virgil van Dijk has already raved about assistant Arne Slot could bring with him to Liverpool\n\nThat does beg one question: why aren't the Reds after the man finishing first? PSV has enjoyed a near-faultless campaign akin to that of Xabi Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen, winning 26 of 30 league games and losing just once.\n\nSuch a question was put to PSV manager Peter Bosz in light of the links between Liverpool and Slot. But the 60-year-old laughed it off (via Dutch outlet FC Update).\n\n\"That didn't happen [a Liverpool approach], did it? I'm having a great time here, so just let me sit here!\"\n\nBosz, who has had stints with Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Lyon, also had a message for his rival Slot. He talked up the \"fantastic\" opportunity:\n\n\"It would be fantastic for Arne. Liverpool is of course a big club, if it all works out and it would, then that would be great for him. He is more than welcome.\"\n\nDespite the plethora of names linked, Bosz has never emerged as a candidate for Liverpool during the hunt for Klopp's heir. Slot himself has come somewhat out of left-field, but looks to be moving ever closer to the role.\n\nLiverpool.com says: PSV is having a wonderful season, and will be confirmed as champion ahead of Feyenoord soon. But Liverpool will have looked at a wide variety of factors.\n\nThere are obvious concerns about Bosz's record elsewhere, with a succession of big clubs outside of the Netherlands ultimately dispensing of his services. Perhaps more importantly, Slot's second place this season is a significant overperformance compared to financial resources, something FSG is bound to value highly.\n\nIt's also only fair to note that Slot did lead Feyenoord to a league title last season, upsetting the relative stranglehold possessed by Ajax and PSV over the last two decades. He's also got a reasonable record in Europe, having led the team to the inaugural Europa Conference League final.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_martin@liverpool.com", "name": "James Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bosz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Bosz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympique Lyonnais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Equipment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article29054734.ece/alternates/s1200/0_slot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He gets along very well with the group of players, is tactically well-versed, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent. I think he can go to any club, even at the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent.\n\n'He has a lot of qualities and he shows it at every level. He first did it at AZ, and now at Feyenoord. And Feyenoord is a really complicated club. He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money.\n\n'He could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football. You can clearly see his hand where he is the coach.\n\n'I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.'\n\nMORE : Chelsea legend John Terry predicts where Arsenal will finish after taking lead in title race again\n\nMORE : Chelsea set to miss out on Victor Osimhen as Napoli striker makes transfer decision", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bosz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Bosz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_Nijmegen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NEC Nijmegen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Heerenveen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SC Heerenveen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

On Sunday the Rotterdam club beat NEC Nijmegen 1-0 to lift the Dutch Cup for the 14th time.\n\nHe has also impressed with his team's attacking style of play, high fitness levels and a meticulous approach to coaching and match preparation.\n\nHis success has been a welcome boost for a club that has been hampered by financial difficulties that have forced Slot to balance the books in the transfer market. Following the Conference League final in 2021 he had to rebuild the squad after nine players were sold.\n\nThe coach himself has given little away about his future plans, but said last week that he \"would talk to the right club if it comes along.\" He has kept his cards close to his chest after the experience of being sacked by AZ in December 2020 when they learned he was in advanced talks to succeed Dick Advocaat.\n\nFeyenoord have cancelled their regular pre-match press conference for Thursday night's league match against Go Ahead Eagles, although the club insist that decision was taken before the cup final.\n\nManaging director Dennis Kroese also said it was no surprise that Slot was attracting interest. \"He has made good progress and given Feyenoord real allure.

The 39-year-old Portuguese manager looked almost certain to be Jurgen Klopp's successor at Liverpool.\n\nHowever, things have changed quite rapidly in the last 48 hours. As Amorim flew to West Ham United to hold meetings, Liverpool have made advances with another manager.\n\nArne Slot is now looking like Michael Edwards' preferred choice for the Liverpool job, and it's a move that could make even more sense for the Reds than Amorim.\n\nSlot's affable and charming personality makes him the kind of character you want to replace Jurgen Klopp with.\n\nHis playing style is also very similar to the German manager. Those things combined mean things won't change too much around Anfield.\n\nBut that is not the main reason why Liverpool have favoured Slot over Amorim. If anything, it will be due to his record in European competitions.\n\nAmorim's Sporting CP have struggled in Europe. His best finish in a European competition was a quarter-final finish.\n\nMeanwhile, Slot guided Feyenoord to the Europa Conference League final in his first season at the club. He lost only to Jose Mourinho's AS Roma in the final.\n\nLast season, he also took Feyenoord, a much weaker squad than Sporting CP, to the quarter finals of the Europa League, and again lost to Mourinho's AS Roma.\n\nThis season, Feyenoord recorded some strong results in the Champions League group-stages, before again being knocked out by AS Roma in the Europa League knock-out stages.\n\nThe fact that Slot does have that track record though of taking Feyenoord to a final, and overachieving in Europe would explain why he is favoured over Amorim. At this stage in his career, Amorim hasn't quite done anything like that.\n\nIt seems like things are moving rapidly with Arne Slot. Liverpool seem to be making quick advances and are now in the negotiation stage of the process.\n\nIt would not be a surprise to see this being wrapped up quite quickly. Given how all of the reliable reporters have now reported on him being the favourite candidate, it looks like it's only a matter of time until he is appointed.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

An outstanding PSV Eindhoven are on the brink of taking Feyenoord's crown, however, though this has still been another very impressive season for the Rotterdammers.\n\nSlot's team could still overtake their title-winning tally of points of 82 from 2022/23, a testament in itself to just how remarkable this PSV team have been. Feyenoord have lost only two league matches throughout the campaign, and defeated NEC Nijmegen to secure the Dutch Cup over the weekend.\n\nLiverpool will no doubt be impressed not only by Slot's high-octane, possession-heavy football - he is 'crazy' about Pep Guardiola - but also his ability to turn good players into great ones.\n\nAlireza Jahanbakhsh, the former Brighton benchwarmer, described him as the 'the best coach in the world at the moment' around 12 months ago. Oussama Idrissi also called Slot the best manager he had ever worked with, and that includes Julen Lopetegui and Manchester United's former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag (The Athletic).\n\nSlot also helped secure big-money moves to high-profile leagues for the likes of Orkun Kokcu and Frederik Aursnes, Luis Sinisterra, Tyrell Malacia, and Marcos Senesi.\n\n\"I think Slot is really good,\" the three-time Ballon D'Or winning Dutch legend Marco van Basten tells Ziggo Sport. \"He can really go anywhere. Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that.\n\n\"I've spoken to him a few times, and he handles the player groups very well. Of course, he is also very well versed tactically.\n\n\"I can explain his ideas well. He is calm and intelligent. As far as I am concerned, he is really a top coach. I really think he can go to any club, even difficult clubs. He's very smart in his choice of words.\"\n\n\"He has a lot of qualities and he shows it at every level,\" adds the AC Milan icon. \"He first did it at AZ, and now at Feyenoord. And Feyenoord is a really complicated club. He has been doing well for three years, while PSV and Ajax have much more options in terms of money.\n\n\"It could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football. You can clearly see his hand wherever he is the coach.\n\n\"I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level, because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. In the end, I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.\"\n\nFeyenoord director Dennis te Kloese was reluctant to give too much away, however, when asked about that Liverpool interest on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_owen@hitc.com", "name": "Dan Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_Nijmegen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NEC Nijmegen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oussama_Idrissi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oussama Idrissi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alireza_Jahanbakhsh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Sinisterra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Sinisterra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Senesi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcos Senesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrell_Malacia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrell Malacia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

But that wasn't right. You just shouldn't expect sliding tackles,\" his former coach Jan Everse told public broadcaster NOS.\n\nBut \"silky\" and \"cultured\" are words often used to describe his playing style, and PEC Zwolle still employ the \"Arne Slot Pass\", says former teammate Bram van Polen.\n\nThe Arne Slot Pass is a slight deflection from a forward with his back to goal which splits the defence and releases a winger running off the ball.\n\n- Dressing room style -\n\nLiverpool fans looking for clues to their potential future boss's style have started sharing a rousing team talk he gave Feyenoord players after an historic victory at Ajax.\n\n\"The reason why we are where we are today is because you work your ass off every single day. And that's the reason you could beat this team in their own stadium, without even our fans being here,\" he told the dressing room.\n\n\"But it's only a win. It's a big win, but we have a bigger goal this season than winning for the first time in 17 years in Amsterdam,\" Slot said to cheers from the team.\n\nSpurs links\n\nThe interest from Liverpool is not the first time Slot has attracted Premier League clubs. He was heavily linked with Tottenham during their troubled search to replace Antonio Conte in May 2023.\n\nAs Spurs were reportedly about to seal the deal, Slot abruptly walked out, signing a new contract instead with Rotterdam-based Feyenoord.\n\n\"The decisive factor was playing in the Champions League... the fact that I am having a great time privately and being able to build on the past two seasons,\" said Slot at the time.\n\nFeyenoord's Champions League campaign got off to a strong start with a 2-0 home win against Celtic, but two defeats against Atletico Madrid sealed their fate, and they finished third in Group E.\n\nGuardiola fan\n\nThe British press have already dubbed Slot the \"Dutch Pep Guardiola\" for the high-pressing attacking style much beloved by Feyenoord fans.\n\nSlot certainly admires the legendary Spanish coach of Manchester City, who would be among his top rivals if he did join Liverpool.\n\nIn several interviews, he has cited Guardiola as his role model, telling the Algemeene Dagblad (AD) last year: \"Players always look very good under him. And the same players seem worse with managers before and after him.\"\n\nRun, run, run\n\nAs a coach, Slot is known for a fierce work ethic, driving to Feyenoord's camp before dawn, watching every training session, and obsessively studying future opponents.\n\n\"I say to Feyenoord: you have to ensure that you create four times as many chances as your opponent and work twice as hard,\" Slot told the AD.\n\n\"In all the matches that we have won this season, we see in the data that we have run 20 or 30 percent more than the opposition. Matches we didn't win: only three or six percent more.\"\n\n\"Every training, every meeting must be spot on,\" he said.\n\nThis has led to results on the pitch at Feyenoord, seen as a team with physically fit players who work hard for each other and often score late goals.\n\nSlot appears to have cultivated this work ethic as a manager, rather than when he was a player.\n\n\"He wants his boys to be fit... he didn't have that before. I don't know if he has ever seen the inside of a weights room,\" said former teammate Van Polen.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Omroep_Stichting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nederlandse Omroep Stichting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_van_Polen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bram van Polen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.france24.com/media/display/155a80e0-02f5-11ef-a579-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/cb10ec2a21a851351d2cdc65a56718bba3f33ea6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Unless there is an exceptional collapse from both Manchester City and Arsenal, the Reds will not lift the title in their manager's final season at the helm, making his final four games more or less a formality.\n\nThat certainly won't be the mood at Anfield when Klopp gets his richly-deserved send-off. While he may not have got his dream goodbye, the German will still leave as one of the greatest legends in Liverpool's storied history.\n\nAnd on a more practical note, Klopp was quick to mention after the loss to Everton that Champions League qualification is not yet safe. Liverpool will want to make sure of that in what remains of the season.\n\nREAD MORE: J\u00fcrgen Klopp gives Liverpool title assessment and makes Champions League admission\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot could take four lessons from Liverpool loss at Everton as Dominik Szoboszlai snaps\n\nBut in practice, much of the attention now turns even more on what comes next for Liverpool. Arne Slot seems to have emerged as a clear favorite to take over from Klopp, moving ahead of R\u00faben Amorim over the past few days. Here, we bring you the latest.\n\nArne Slot to Liverpool 'done deal'\n\nIt certainly seems like Feyenoord boss Slot has been made Liverpool's favored candidate. The Athletic claimed yesterday that the Reds had seen an opening approach to the club rejected, but that they will try again, with the manager himself 'enthusiastic' about the move.\n\nIt also reported that Liverpool will continue to assess other candidates. But Dutch journalist Steve Kooijman has taken a more bullish line on talkSPORT. He claims that Slot to Liverpool is already a 'done deal', and that he will '100 per cent' be the next manager at Anfield.\n\n\"Yeah, we know him quite a bit and know Feneyoord as well,\" said Kooijman. \"They're looking already looking for a new manager - it's a done deal, yeah.\"\n\nWhether or not that's a little premature, things certainly seem to be moving in the direction of appointing Slot. It would certainly be an intriguing hire from FSG head of football Michael Edwards.\n\nR\u00faben Amorim claim made\n\nIf Slot is coming to Liverpool, where does that leave Amorim? For a short while, the answer seemed to be West Ham, with the Sporting coach flying into London for talks.\n\nBut it appears those did not go especially well. And in a surprising twist, having been admired by a number of teams and linked especially heavily with Liverpool, it's now claimed that Amorim might stay put.\n\nIn a report from Portuguese channel RTP shared by a third party to X, it's claimed that the official decision will be announced on Saturday. Amorim had previously quipped to reporters that he would 'see them on Saturday' when touching down on his way back from England, although that was thought to be in reference to his press conference ahead of the weekend's game with Porto.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_martin@liverpool.com", "name": "James Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Amorim", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Amorim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Porto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article29056250.ece/alternates/s1200/0_arneslot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

figure which'd satisfy Feyenoord, who understandably want to hold out for the best possible amount before letting Slot leave.\n\nHistorically one of Netherlands' most successful clubs, the Rotterdam outfit have won just four trophies in the past seven seasons including the current campaign, and two of those were Dutch Super Cups, the country's equivalent of the Community Shield here (Transfermarkt).\n\nThe other two were the Eredivisie title and KNVB Cup that the 45-year-old has delivered over the past 12 months, and they were within 90 minutes of winning the inaugural Europa Conference League two years ago, which was also under his watch.\n\nSlot has restored Feyenoord's reputation as a genuine Dutch powerhouse after two decades of mediocrity, similar to what Klopp achieved with Liverpool in England and Europe.\n\nWhile the job spec at Anfield would be rather different (i.e. preserving the club's competitiveness at the top level rather than reviving a sleeping giant), it's encouraging to hear that the prospective new manager is seemingly relishing that challenge.\n\nIf he's the man that Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes truly want, we'd like to think that they'll stump up a sufficiently inviting compensation package to sway the hierarchy at De Kuip.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Empire of The Kop"},

Ten Hag's best season in the Dutch league was superior to Slot's, but he has struggled in England, and Jamie Carragher has expressed concern about how tough a challenge Slot faces at Liverpool.\n\nIt looks like Liverpool are closing in on a Jurgen Klopp successor, with Feyenoord's Arne Slot reportedly engaging in talks with the club about taking over in the summer. The Dutchman has built a solid reputation as a coach through his work with Feyenoord in the Eredivisie. He's won a league title with the club, he's still relatively young and it seems like the next plausible move for him is to make that step up and manage in the Premier League.\n\nWe've heard all of this before though, haven't we? Manchester United were in a similar position a couple of years ago when they needed to replace Ole Gunnar Solksjaer, and they too turned to the Netherlands where they handpicked Erik ten Hag as their next boss. The 54-year-old was held in high regard by many all over the world for the excellent job he did in charge of Ajax.\n\nRelated How Liverpool Could Line Up Under Arne Slot The Feyenoord manager is in talks to take over from Jurgen Klopp and this is how his side could line up next season\n\nTen Hag took them to several league titles and even saw relative success in Europe, with an impressive run to the Champions League semi-finals. His time in England hasn't been quite as fruitful, though. At Old Trafford, the Dutchman has struggled to replicate his success with Ajax and has often come under scrutiny for the manner in which his side has underperformed. It's hard to say how Slot will fare in England if he is to take the Liverpool job, but considering his career looks to be following a similar trajectory to Ten Hag, let's compare their best seasons in the Eredivisie.\n\nErik ten Hag's Best Season Came in 2020/21 He guided Ajax to a domestic double\n\nWhile he may have his sceptics and doubters now, Ten Hag was beloved at Ajax and for good reason. Across five years with the Dutch club, he enjoyed great success, but it was the 2020/21 season that was his best. Coming off the back of two straight league titles, there's a risk that a team can grow stagnant and lose the motivation to keep performing at such a high level.\n\nThat wasn't the case for Ten Hag's Ajax, though, who had their best season under him to record their third straight league title. That year, the club lost just two league games, finishing 16 points clear of PSV Eindhoven in second. With 88 points and a miraculous goal difference of +79, they completely blew their opponents out of the water all year long.\n\nAjax scored 102 goals that campaign, and there have been few sides quite as impressive in recent memory. They weren't just successful in the league, though, winning the KNVB Cup as well, completing a domestic double. He was ultimately given the Rinus Michels Award that year, a trophy annually presented to the best coach in Eredivisie. It was his second of two straight seasons where he won the award, something that's only been matched by three other coaches and interestingly, Slot is one of them.\n\nErik ten Hag's 2020/21 Eredivisie season\n\nPoints\n\n88\n\nGames won\n\n28\n\nGames drawn\n\n4\n\nGames lost\n\n2\n\nGoals scored\n\n102\n\nPoints-per-game\n\n2.59\n\nArne Slot's Best Season Came in 2022/23 He took Feyenoord to their first league title in six years\n\nWith Ten Hag leaving Ajax in the summer of 2022, there was an opportunity to usurp the club and that's exactly what Slot and his Feyenoord team did the very next season. He took the team to the top of the division, winning their first league title in six years and just their second in the 21st century. They picked up 82 points along the way, the joint-highest tally the club has ever won, a testament to the incredible work that they were doing.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Erik ten Hag and Arne Slot are two of just four managers to win the Rinus Michels Award in two straight years\n\nSimilar to Ten Hag's best Ajax season, Feyenoord lost just twice in the league during Slot's best season. They recorded a goal difference of of +51 and finished seven points clear of PSV Eindhoven in second place. They failed to win any other trophy, but their manager was presented with the Rinus Michels Award for the second straight year.\n\nSlot's best season at Feyenoord wasn't anywhere near as dominant as Ten Hag's strongest campaign with Ajax, but that doesn't necessarily mean he'll fare worse if he is to come to England. Only time will tell how a potential appointment at Liverpool would play out for the 45-year-old.\n\nArne Slot's 2022/23 Eredivisie season\n\nPoints\n\n82\n\nGames won\n\n25\n\nGames drawn\n\n7\n\nGames lost\n\n2\n\nGoals scored\n\n81\n\nPoints-per-game\n\n2.41\n\nJamie Carragher Isn't Convinced About Slot The ex-defender thinks the jump from Feyenoord to Liverpool might be too big\n\nReplacing Jurgen Klopp is always going to be a difficult job. The Reds coach has become a club legend over the last nine years, and Liverpool need to get his replacement nailed on. Otherwise, they risk taking a huge step back and undoing a lot of the work he's done.\n\nWhether that is Slot or not, Jamie Carragher isn't too confident about the potential hire. Speaking ahead of the Reds' Premier League match with Everton, the former defender admitted he thought the jump from Feyenoord to Liverpool was a big one.\n\n\"I think from Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump. Slot is the favourite right now. I don't think it's like Rafa Benitez coming in, or Jurgen Klopp. When Rafa Benitez is coming in off the back of two La Liga titles and a UEFA cup, or Jurgen Klopp coming in winning a couple of league titles with Borussia Dortmund and getting to a Champions League final.\n\nLiverpool were actually in a different space then. We were a team trying to qualify for the top four. Liverpool are in a different area now. They're actually fancying themselves to challenge for the Premier League every season. I think it's a huge jump.\"\n\nWith Xabi Alonso ruling himself out of the running and publicly stating his intention to remain at Bayer Leverkusen, Slot might just be the best possible option left on the table for Liverpool. Whether he has a similar experience to Ten Hag in England remains to be seen, but with Klopp's departure coming in just over a month, the Reds might find out soon enough.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinus_Michels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rinus Michels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben\u00edtez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web_Applications", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web Applications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mixcollage-25-apr-2024-11-38-am-8210_720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Sound familiar?\n\nSlot was named the top manager in the Eredivise for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, leading Feyenoord to the Europa Conference League Final in 2021-22, the Eredivisie crown in 2022-23, and the KNVB Cup this season.\n\nFeyenoord have succeeded even with star turnover, as Slot has had to navigate sales of stars Luis Sinisterra (Leeds), Tyrell Malacia (Manchester United), and Marcos Senesi (Bournemouth) among others.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Cambuur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SC Cambuur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Sinisterra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Sinisterra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Senesi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcos Senesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrell_Malacia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrell Malacia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b9dd291/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5297x2980+0+276/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F40%2F83%2F0bd3a0544a6d975b3ffaa4e4eabf%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2147989790", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

for his attacking football and style of play.\n\nAnd while there might be some doubts over whether he can step into Klopp's shoes, who has become a legendary figure at Liverpool, there can be no question marks over his wily attitude.\n\nSuch an instance came to light during an Eredivisie match between Feyenoord and Ajax in his first season in charge of the Rotterdam outfit.\n\nIn March 2022, Ajax were winning 3-2 against Feyenoord and in the dying seconds of the match, Antony, who was at Ajax at the time, tried to get his opponent sent off by hitting the ground and rolling on the floor in front of Slot.\n\nAs the commotion died down, the referee brandished a yellow card at the Brazilian and sending him off, after he was booked earlier in the contest.\n\nSlot responded by simply laughing at the forward while the Ajax players were furious with the referee.\n\nAntony has since signed for Manchester United, along with Erik ten Hag, who was in charge of Ajax at the time.\n\nWith Ajax and Feyenoord being one of the fiercest rivalries in the Netherlands, both managers meeting again next season with United and Liverpool could be a tasty encounter.\n\nHowever, first the Reds need to sign Slot, who is on the final shortlist to replace Klopp, talkSPORT understands.\n\nThe 45-year-old has scored highly on Liverpool's data-led approach but he might not be cheap having signed a new contract last year at De Kuip.\n\nTottenham had been keen on hiring the coach to replace Antonio Conte last summer but Slot turned them down, instead turning to Ange Postecoglou.\n\nLiverpool could

The former AZ boss led his team to the Eredivisie title last season and is on course for a runner-up finish this time around.\n\nKlopp is leaving in the summer after nearly nine years at the helm, having delivered Liverpool their first league title of the Premier League era. The Merseyside club also won the Champions League in 2019 and reached the final on two other occasions, but their quest for Europa League glory this term fell short.\n\nSlot's links with Liverpool come with another Eredivisie winner, Erik ten Hag, struggling in his second season in charge of Manchester United. Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of the Merseyside Derby, Carragher offered a reminder to the potential new boss, while comparing his attributes to those of Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim after the pair were also linked after Klopp's exit announcement.\n\n\"What I would say from Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump and I think it shows in this moment a lack of real top managers out there when you look at who Liverpool were going for,\" Carragher said. \"Initially probably Xabi Alonso but it was only his first full season as a manager. There was talk of Amorin from Sporting Lisbon but he's only 39.\n\n\"Now Arne Slot looks like he is the favourite right now. I don't think it's like Rafa Benitez coming on or Jurgen Klopp coming in. Benitez came off the back of winning two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup and Jurgen Klopp coming after winning a couple of titles with Borussia Dortmund and getting to a Champions League final.\n\n\"Liverpool were in a different space then, and that was a Liverpool team under Rafa Benitez that I was part of that was trying to qualify for the top four, the same with Jurgen Klopp when he came in. Liverpool are in a different area now and fancy themselves to challenge for the Premier League next season and the Champions League, they will be expected to reach the quarter-finals at least. I think it is a huge jump, he's obviously a great coach and has a good track record with the clubs he has had so far, so we will see.\"\n\nIs Arne Slot the best fit for Liverpool? Have your say in the comments section\n\nJamie Carragher has reminded Arne Slot of the size of task that he could face\n\nBayer Leverkusen boss Alonso, a former team-mate of Carragher's at Anfield, was heavily linked with a return as manager before committing his future to the German club. Leverkusen have gone the whole season unbeaten, clinching the Bundesliga title with time to spare and still vying for the Europa League and DFB-Pokal.\n\n\"Last week I had a very good meeting when I informed them [Leverkusen's directors] of my decision to continue being coach of Bayer Leverkusen,\" the former Spain midfielder said when confirming he would stay put. \"For sure all the decisions you need to analyse well. I try to take the right ones, I try to take them in a natural way.\n\n\"At the moment this is the right place for me to develop as a coach, I am a young coach. Right now this is the right place. I have to thank the management. The club had been supportive and I feel respected by all departments.\n\n\"The fans they have shown great support and they have reasons to believe and dream we will have a great season. I have a great staff to help me work day by day, and so for sure the players.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

We will focus on that next season, but that is still a long way off.\"\n\nLiverpool saw an opening offer worth around \u00a37.7million including bonuses rejected by Feyenoord on Wednesday morning. The Reds tabled an initial \u00a36m upfront with a further \u00a31.7m in performance-related bonuses but Feyenoord are believed to be holding out for a total package of \u00a38.5m.\n\nFurthermore, Liverpool are also facing additional challenges replacing an array of Klopp's departing backroom staff.\n\nSlot hopes to bring his assistant coach Sipke Hulshoff with him to Merseyside while his current head of performance, Ruben Peeters, is also likely to join Liverpool, replacing Andreas Schlumberger.\n\nHowever, Slot's assistant trainer John de Wolf looks likely to stay put in Holland having recently extended his contract at De Kuip and he could form part of the new-look coaching setup in Rotterdam if Slot does indeed depart.\n\nArne Slot is in line to be Liverpool's next manager\n\nLiverpool will also need to replace Pepijn Lijnders, goalkeeping coach John Achterberg, Peter Krawietz, fitness chief Andreas Kornmayer and nutritionist Nona Meyer among others.\n\nMeanwhile, Slot's agent Rafaela Pimenta is currently negotiating his contract with the Reds. Face-to-face discussions between Liverpool and the Dutch giants are expected to take place in the coming days but Feyenoord director Dennis te Kloese is understood to have been in Madrid this week on a separate business venture.\n\nThe Reds still have four games left before their season is complete as they face trips to West Ham and Aston Villa while also hosting Tottenham and Wolves at Anfield.\n\nKlopp is believed to have had no involvement in the search for his replacement as the process is being led and driven by Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

While Van Basten believes the 45-year-old can do even better at a bigger club with more resources, Jonk thinks he will do well at the \"Feyenoord of England.\"\n\nSince Klopp announced his decision to step down as manager at the end of the 2023-24 season, Liverpool have been scouring the market for his successor. Ex-Liverpool star and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso was initially the hot favorite for the job. But the Spaniard quickly put those rumors to bed by committing his future to the Bundesliga champions. Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim then emerged as a top candidate but according to top journalists, including Fabrizio Romano, talks have stalled between the manager and the club and may not resume.\n\nWith Amorim also out of the picture, Feyenoord manager Slot has become a prime candidate for the Liverpool job. Romano has reported that the two parties have already met, confirming the legitimacy of the rumors.\n\nVan Basten and Jonk have discussed Slot's potential switch to Liverpool, explaining why he will be a great appointment.\n\nDutch legend Van Basten began by saying (via TeamTalk):\n\n\"He can really go anywhere - Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I'm really convinced of that.\n\n\"I've spoken to him a few times and I think what he does and what he sees is very strong. He gets along very well with the group of players, is tactically well-versed, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent. I think he can go to any club, even at the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent.\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"He could really fit anywhere. If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play football, you also get big clubs like AC Milan to play football. You can clearly see his hand where he is the coach.\n\n\"I think it will even be easier for him at a higher level because he has better players who understand his ideas faster. I also think he is smart enough to manage stubborn players.\"\n\nJonk, meanwhile, claimed Slot's success at Feyenoord will help him at Anfield.\n\nHe noted:\n\n\"He [Slot] gave Feyenoord a face. Arne has made enormous strides, so I would like that. Liverpool is also a bit like the Feyenoord of England.\"\n\nSlot guided Feyenoord to the Eredivisie title in the 2022-23 season and the KNVB Cup this year. He has managed them in 144 games over the last three seasons, guiding them to 93 wins, 27 draws, and 24 defeats.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Jonk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wim Jonk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Just ask Dutch legend Marco van Basten, who has been hugely impressed with his work.\n\n\"I really think he is that good,\" the former striker told Rondo, a Dutch talkshow on Ziggo Sport. \"He could end up anywhere. Bayern Munich, Liverpool, you name it. I'm really convinced of that.\"\n\nLiverpool's owners are adamant that will be their club, as Slot has impressed them with his attacking blend of football, constantly pressing opponents high up the field - reminiscent of the football played at Anfield under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nJust like the German manager, Slot is prepared to take that approach against anyone.\n\nA telling example was Feyenoord's Champions League match at Atletico Madrid earlier this season.\n\nTheir intensity helped them achieve seven shots on target, a total last bettered by a visiting side against Atletico in the Champions League when Real Madrid managed eight in 2015, according to Opta.\n\nThis season was Feyenoord's first Champions League's campaign in six years, but they excelled in winning the ball high up the pitch, resulting in dangerous situations.\n\nIn their six group matches, they won the ball back 59 times in the last 40 metres of the pitch in open play, with only four teams doing that more often.\n\nSlot's teams play well in possession, and his players overlap to provide an extra layer of unpredictability.\n\n\"I've spoken to him a few times and what he does and what he sees is very good,\" explains Van Basten. \"He gets on with the squad very well, is tactically very astute, can explain things well and is calm and intelligent.\n\n\"I think he can go to any club, yes. Even to the very difficult clubs, because he is so intelligent.\"\n\nApart from his tactical expertise and meticulous preparations, Slot is also good at building a team with modest resources.\n\nSeven players who started the 2022 Europa Conference League final defeat by Roma left Feyenoord that summer. Slot, though, built a team with new recruits such as Santiago Gimenez, Sebastian Szymanski and Mats Wieffer - all for nominal fees - who would prove pivotal in securing a first Dutch title in six years.\n\nLast summer, again, they lost important players in Szymanski and Orkun Kokcu, but have had a strong season once more, winning the Dutch Cup last Sunday.\n\nFeyenoord spent around \u00a330m on players in each of the past two campaigns, whereas Ajax have had an outlay of almost \u00a3100m in each of theirs.\n\nOn top of that, Slot gives young talent a chance.\n\nQuinten Timber - twin brother of Arsenal's Jurrien - and Quilindschy Hartman have developed very well under his tutelage and become pillars of the team, with both making their debut for the Dutch national team this season as well.\n\nSlot is inspired by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, studying every small detail.\n\n\"I certainly don't want to compare myself to Pep, but he is a control freak just like me,\" Slot said in an interview with Voetbal International in May 2023.\n\n\"If I look at myself, I try to win a match in the week before it is played, by conveying the training, pre-match team talks and tactics to the players as perfectly as possible.\"\n\nHe said previously watching Guardiola's teams gives him the \"ultimate joy in football\".\n\n\"There is no team in the world I would rather watch than Manchester City, followed by Napoli, Arsenal and Brighton,\" added Slot.\n\n\"But City - and again it is not my intention to compare us with them - have a similar style of play to how we want to play with Feyenoord: 4-3-3, building up from the back, wanting to apply pressure quickly.\"\n\nLast season, Leeds and Crystal Palace were said to be interested and Tottenham were very keen on his services, but Slot opted to stay in the Netherlands, where he had just won the title and was looking ahead to guiding Feyenoord in the Champions League.\n\nVan Basten doesn't think a move to the Premier League would be a step too high.\n\n\"If you get AZ and Feyenoord to play [good] football, you will also get the big clubs to play [good] football,\" says Van Basten.\n\n\"I think it would only become easier for him because you have better players who understand quicker what you want. Those players are also more stubborn, but I think Slot is smart enough to manage that.\"\n\nThe Dutchman has a calm and balanced approach, which works well with his players and was highlighted in one of his post-match dressing room talks last season.\n\nAfter Feyenoord beat rivals Ajax for the first time away in the league in 17 seasons, a video released by the club showed Slot talking about the importance of the weeks to come.\n\n\"Because this is only a win. It's not more than a win, it's a big win, but it's not more than a win,\" said Slot in the video. \"We have a bigger goal this season than only winning for the first time in 17 years in Amsterdam. Our goal is bigger than that.\"\n\nFeyenoord duly went on to clinch the league title.\n\nThis year they are in good form again and could even get a higher points tally than last season's 82, but PSV's impressive form means they will probably have to settle for second, which would still guarantee Champions League football.\n\nNow Slot could be set to embrace another rivalry, this time with a manager he so admires in Guardiola.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilindschy_Hartman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quilindschy Hartman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Wieffer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mats Wieffer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinten_Timber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quinten Timber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The Dutchman, who turned down Spurs before the London club appointed Ange Postecoglou, is set to follow up last season's title win with a second-place finish behind PSV Eindhoven this term.\n\nThe returning Michael Edwards is likely to have a major say in any transfer business over the summer, but Klopp had involvement during Edwards' previous spell. Slot has overseen significant player turnover across the last 12 months, just as Klopp did with his midfield rebuild at Anfield, and he knows how to bring starters into a squad.\n\nFeyenoord signed more than 10 players - either permanently or on loan, since the summer of 2023. Here, Mirror Football has taken a look at the last 10 to get a feel for what Liverpool fans might expect if the 45-year-old comes in.\n\nAnis Hadj Moussa\n\nSlot's most recent signing is a player who hasn't actually joined Feyenoord yet. Algerian forward Hadj Moussa will arrive in the summer, just a few months after making his Eredivisie debut on loan at Vitesse.\n\nThe 22-year-old has two goals and two assists in all competitions in the Netherlands, having begun the season in the Belgian second tier. His arrival suggests a willingness to back a player of limited top level experience as long as the promise is there.\n\nMikki van Sas\n\nAnother youngster, Van Sas joined from Manchester City's academy in September. The 20-year-old goalkeeper has yet to make his senior Feyenoord debut, but has been on the bench in the Champions League and Europa League this term.\n\nThe Dutch Under-19 international revealed upon his unveiling that he had been scouted by the Rotterdam club as a teen. Previous rejections appear to be no barrier to deals further down the line.\n\nLuka Ivanusec\n\nWould Arne Slot be a good fit for Liverpool? Have your say in the comments section\n\nCroatia international Luka Ivanusec is one of Slot's more experienced recent signings\n\nThe first name on the list to have represented Feyenoord at the time of writing, Ivanusec joined from Dinamo Zagreb in his homeland of Croatia. The winger played three times for his country at Euro 2020, showing Slot is prepared to add more experienced figures when the price is right.\n\nArriving for just \u00a36.7m (according to Transfermarkt), Ivanusec has struggled with injury this season but has still managed 20 league outings. He scored a hat-trick for Dinamo in Champions League qualifying, but has only netted once in the Eredivisie.\n\nOndrej Lingr\n\nLingr, 25, joined on a season-long loan from Slavia Prague in August. Another full international, the attacking midfielder arrived with a record of contributing goals from a withdrawn role, with successive double-figure seasons in the Czech Republic.\n\nHe has been used out wide as well as in the number 10 role, but Slot has so far been sparing with him. All 21 of Lingr's outings have come from the bench, with the manager prepared to let the new man work for his first start.\n\nBart Nieuwkoop\n\nDutch defender Nieuwkoop arrived from Union SG, where he spent last season linking up with Brighton winger Simon Adingra. The 28-year-old started out at Feyenoord, failing to hold down a first-team place, but Slot has been prepared to give him a second chance.\n\nBart Nieuwkoop is back at Feyenoord for a second spell\n\nWhile the first half of his season was interrupted by injury, Nieuwkoop has featured more since the turn of the year. He made four appearances in the run to KNVB Cup glory, starting the victory over NEC in the final.\n\nKostas Lamprou\n\nLamprou is another player who demonstrates Slot's willingness to offer second chances. The Greek goalkeeper returned to De Kuip nine years after departing, having done the rounds in the top two tiers of Dutch football.\n\nLiverpool boss Klopp hasn't been afraid to add experienced backup keepers on a free, with Adrian and Alex Manninger among those brought to Anfield during his tenure. With the former out of contract this summer, might there be room for another similar deal?\n\nAyase Ueda Japan striker Ayase Ueda hasn't quite hit his stride in Rotterdam\n\nThe most expensive signing on the list, Ueda still only cost a relatively reasonable \u00a36.9m. The Japan international was part of his country's 2022 World Cup squad but not one of the star names - rather, he was a star in waiting when he moved to Rotterdam.\n\nAs with a few others, the striker has mostly been used as a sub despite hitting 22 in Belgium the season prior, scoring twice in less than 500 Eredivisie minutes. He enjoyed a breakout Asian Cup, though, ending the tournament as his country's top scorer with four goals in as many starts.\n\nCalvin Stengs\n\nDutch international Stengs was hot property when he left Slot's AZ for Nice in 2021. It didn't quite work out for him in Ligue 1, but Slot wasn't going to turn down the chance to reunite with the 25-year-old.\n\nFormer AZ man Calvin Stengs is working under Arne Slot at a second club\n\nStengs has hit double figures for assists this term, with only PSV duo Luuk de Jong and Joey Veerman besting his tally. He also has five league goals - plus one in the Champions League victory over Celtic - suggesting the reunion has gone pretty well so far.\n\nThomas Beelen\n\nYoung defender Beelen set Feyenoord back just \u00a32.3m, coming through the same PEC Zwolle production line that produced current Liverpool defender Sepp van den Berg. A tall centre-back, just like Klopp likes them, the 22-year-old has featured in more than half of Feyenoord's games this term.\n\nLiverpool will need to make decisions at centre-back, namely on whether to hand Joel Matip a new deal and how they deal with Virgil van Dijk entering the final year of his own contract. Klopp hasn't been afraid to trust in youth, and Slot isn't too different.\n\nYankuba Minteh Yankuba Minteh has impressed since joining Feyenoord on loan from Newcastle\n\nSpeaking of youth, 19-year-old Minteh has been backed despite his tender age. Liverpool might not need to test the water with top teams' youngsters, but Gambia international Minteh has enjoyed his season on loan from Newcastle.\n\nWith nine league goals, the winger sits joint-second in the club's scoring charts behind Premier League linked Santiago Gimenez. Liverpool have benefited greatly from goals from out wide, so this may be music to fans' ears.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Klopp announced in January that he would be stepping down from his role as Liverpool manager at the end of the season.\n\nIn the months since the announcement, several names have emerged in the rumour mill about who could be Klopp's successor in the Anfield dugout. Xabi Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen and Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon were both linked with the vacancy in the early weeks after Klopp's announcement.\n\nAccording to Danish news outlet Tipsbladet, Liverpool held initial talks with Frank at Brentford over the future vacancy. It has been claimed that Frank has been \"under consideration\" by the Anfield hierarchy, which even led to the Reds holding talks with the Bees manager's representatives over the possibility of him taking charge this summer.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot speaks out for first time after being asked about Liverpool manager job\n\nREAD MORE: I played with Arne Slot after leaving Liverpool - he is perfect successor for Jurgen Klopp\n\nFrank has been in charge at Brentford since 2018 and guided the club to promotion to the Premier League three years later.

That will become four once this evening's Merseyside Derby is done and dusted.\n\nAs a result, Liverpool are not far out from being without someone in charge of the first-team squad. Things need to move fast.\n\nThankfully, it now finally looks as though they are. The Reds have taken their time - and ruled out some pretty big names in the process - but it looks like it's all coming together at Anfield.\n\nAnd as updates slowly start to filter through about who the new man could be, it seems that one manager is already house-hunting in the Liverpool area.\n\nThroughout the process of deliberation over who should follow Klopp at Liverpool, FSG have seemingly remained calm.\n\nChoosing the successor to the Reds most loved and trophy-laden manager of the modern era was never going to be easy. Cool heads were needed.\n\nThankfully, Michael Edwards is about as cool as they come. FSG'S CEO of football was reportedly prepared to be 'bold not popular' with his decision and that looks to have come to fruition.\n\nAs has been reported just about everywhere by now, Feyenoord's Arne Slot is the man Liverpool are now zoning in on to be in the dugout next season. And according to Dutch outlet 1908.NL, Slot himself is getting excited over the move.\n\nThey claim that the 45-year-old is 'very charmed' by the idea of joining the Reds and is gently pushing to leave Feyenoord. In fact, so 'convinced' is Slot said to be, that he and his agent, Rafaela Pimeata are ready to discuss the final details of the contract with Liverpool.\n\nThe expectation from there is reportedly that Slot with become new Liverpool manager. However, it's claimed that the deal is not done yet. Meetings are said to be scheduled 'in the coming days.' From there, Liverpool will need to strike a deal with Feyenoord, who will reportedly want a 'serious transfer fee.'\n\nNot only do 1908.NL report that a deal is expected to be hammered out between Slot and Liverpool, but they give an indication into his personal life, too.\n\nThey claim that the 'entire Slot family' will join Arne in England if things are finalised. In preparation for that, the Dutchman is said to be now looking for houses 'in and around Liverpool.'\n\nThis all sounds to be very promising indeed. Unless anything dramatic happens from here, we'd suggest that the Reds have found their man.\n\nIn our opinion, we're not quite sure how to feel about it all just yet. We still can't imagine the club with Jurgen. But, in terms of Slot, Liverpool will reportedly be getting a coach who is 'almost like a maniac' [TalkSPORT] in the way his teams attack.\n\nIt all sounds intriguing and when the time comes, Arne will be welcomed to the area with open arms.

Right now, Liverpool are probably in the best top five or six teams in Europe and they have been for a few years and that's why I go back to Tuchel.\"\n\n\"He's beat Pep. I just think of a guy standing on the sideline and you're a Liverpool supporter and you're looking at him thinking 'he can go up against him'. If he gets to the final, he'll have been in three of the last six Champions League finals. Now, I know it hasn't gone perfectly at Bayern Munich for him, but the job he did at Chelsea and trying to take on Klopp's Liverpool and Pep's Man City, he's got something about him - that's my thing,\" he added.\n\nSlot won't head to Anfield with that kind of reputation in place but Tuchel had to earn it and so did Klopp, building up their standing in the game through results.\n\nSlot impressed at AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord and is now ready for the next step in his career.\n\nPerhaps the jump from Feyenoord to Liverpool is a big one, but Slot deserves a chance to show that he can go up against Guardiola and Mikel Arteta with Liverpool clearly impressed by his work.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olly_dawes@hitc.com", "name": "Olly Dawes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Kuip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Kuip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1494026783-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The two clubs are reportedly discussing compensation for the 45-year-old manager.\n\nA move to the Premier League will be an exciting step up in the manager's career and he will look to win major trophies with Liverpool. They have the resources to bring in quality players and they have an exceptional squad at the disposal as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool's season seems to have collapsed at the very end with the Reds dropping points consistently.

It is unclear at this stage if he would stay on in a dual role, if he is to join Slot at Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool.com says: Slot appears to be the man chosen to replace Klopp at Anfield and it will not be an easy challenge.

The Dutch club are consigned to losing their manager and have already taken steps towards finding a replacement, having identified FC Twente boss Joseph Oosting as a target.\n\nHowever, despite the wheels being in motion, Slot remains Feyenoord boss and is in the City of Deventer on Thursday night to manage his side against Go Ahead Eagles in the Eredivisie. It was there that he was quizzed by Sky Sports reporter Gary Cotterill as he got off the team bus.\n\nCotterill tried his very best to put his questions to Slot, but struggled with a security guard ushering him away. \"You're in the news,\" Cotterill began, to which Slot smiled and replied: \"I am, I can't deny that.\" Cotterill then said: \"You said you wanted to go to the Premier League - is it a possibility?\"\n\nSlot was not sticking around to hear anything else he had to stay, quickly climbing up the steps with his shirt and suitcase in hand. With a suited security guard shadowing him, Cotterill only managed to get out the words \"well, Liverpool want you\" and \"good luck\" before his target disappeared.\n\nLiverpool aren't the first Premier League side to try and hire Slot - Tottenham came close to doing so last May, but couldn't agree terms and ended up going for Ange Postecoglou instead. While careful to be respectful of his employers, Slot has not tried to hide his ambitions.\n\nGary Cotterill followed him up the steps, but had little success\n\nSpeaking around the time that Spurs were chasing him, the 45-year-old said: \"The next step will not be another club in Holland. If that is the next step, I've failed completely in the upcoming few years. A normal next step would be to go abroad and I've always said that the best league in the world is the Premier League.\"\n\nHe won the Eredivisie with Feyenoord last season and has secured the Dutch cup this season - and it is his playing style which has attracted Liverpool. Slot is known for his high-pressing, high-energy style that bears many hallmarks of Klopp's with the Reds.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Kuyt played 208 times for Liverpool, scoring 51 goals, and he has now moved into coaching including having a stint with Feyenoord.\n\nLast year, Kuyt suggested that Liverpool should be taking a look at a couple of Feyenoord players. He was also quick to praise Slot's work, long before anyone knew that Klopp was leaving and the former AZ Alkmaar boss could be an option to replace the German.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool candidate Arne Slot 'questioned' Mikel Arteta methods before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho 'row'\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool injury latest and return dates before Everton as J\u00fcrgen Klopp gives Diogo Jota update\n\nLutsharel Geertruida and Orkun K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc were the two stars in question. Speaking to the Liverpool ECHO last year, Kuyt said: \"I am a Feyenoord man and they are doing very well at the moment.\n\n\"They have a very good manager in Slot and some of the younger guys like K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc and Geertruida are knocking on the door and playing very well. It won't take long for the interest of top European teams to be there for them. I hope Liverpool is interested in Feyenoord players, and I am an example it can work!\"\n\nGeertruida is a versatile 23-year-old who can play at center-back, right-back and holding midfield, and signing a new defender would appear to be logical for Liverpool this summer given that Jo\u00ebl Matip is set to leave at the end of his contract. Geertruida has played 43 times so far this term for Feyenoord and he has scored seven times and assisted another four.\n\nK\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc, meanwhile, is a holding midfielder, but he no longer plays for Feyenoord. Last summer, he moved to Benfica for a fee of around $32m (\u00a326m/\u20ac30m). Liverpool had been linked tentatively with a move for him at the time amid its midfield revamp.\n\nLiverpool.com says: If it is to be Slot that takes over at Anfield, there will be no repeat of the Erik ten Hag situation at Manchester United where he was simply allowed to sign as many of his favorite players from his former club as possible, no matter the cost. Just because a player has impressed with Feyenoord, that does not mean that he will suddenly shoot up Liverpool's list.\n\nKuyt clearly rates Slot, though, and the Feyenoord boss' record speaks for itself. He won the Eredivisie last season and the Dutch cup this year, and his sides always perform well above where they should based on how much they spend.

The Feyenoord manager in talks to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool", "body": "Liverpool, currently in a three-way race for the Premier League title, were hit in their search when early favourite Xabi Alonso decided to stay at Bayer Leverkusen. Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim has also been linked with the job.\n\nBut Slot, who this season has won the Dutch Cup and won the Eredivisie last year, is now the favourite - yet who is the 45-year-old and what has he done to be a frontrunner for the Anfield vacancy?\n\nPrior to his coaching journey, Slot enjoyed an 18-year playing career as a midfielder in the Netherlands, playing for seven years at FC Zwolle and five years at NAC Breda.\n\nHe was part of a promotion-winning side at the former from the second tier to the top-flight, while he finished fourth in the Eredivisie at Breda and played in the UEFA Cup against Newcastle United in 2003, losing 6-0 on aggregate.\n\nSlot, known for his passing and vision, later had spells at Sparta Rotterdam and PEC Zwolle before retiring in 2013 at the age of 35.\n\nBut in the last 10 years, he has developed steadily as a coach. The Dutchman moved straight away onto the coaching staff at first division club PEC Zwolle, working as a youth coach for one year before moving on to be assistant at then-Eredivisie side Cambuur.\n\nHe was a No 2 under three different head coaches before he took interim charge in October 2016, with the club 14 in the second division. However, he helped them to third in the league, missing out on promotion in the play-offs and a spot in the Dutch Cup final - having earlier beaten Ajax - on penalties in the semi-finals.\n\nDespite his impressive first outing as a head coach, Slot moved to AZ Alkmaar to be assistant to John van den Brom. He stayed in his role for two seasons before he succeeded Van den Brom as head coach. He finished second behind Ajax on goal-difference but the Eredivisie was cancelled due to the Covid pandemic.\n\nSlot was then sacked as AZ head coach in December 2020, having negotiated a deal to join rivals Feyenoord for the following season. The coach left with 2.11 points per game in the league, the highest of any coach in AZ history.\n\nBut his time in Feyenoord has been an overwhelming success. He guided the team to the inaugural UEFA Conference League final in his first season, losing to Roma in the final, and third in the Eredivisie.\n\nHaving extended his contract in the summer of 2022, Slot guided Feyenoord to their 16 league title and first since 2017. They were, however, again knocked out of Europe by Roma, this time at the quarter-final stage of the Europa League.\n\nSlot then reportedly turned down the Tottenham job last summer, penning a new deal to 2026, and embarked on another season with Feyenoord. His side won the Dutch Cup on Sunday, beating NEC in the final, and are currently second in the Eredivisie. Liverpool were keen to act respectfully and did not make any approach prior to the final.\n\nNow, Slot looks set for a highly-anticipated move away from the Netherlands. He is said to be eager to join Liverpool, with compensation set to be around the \u00a310m mark, and the release clause in his contract can't be activated until next year.\n\nSlot is known for his aggressive, dominant style of football and places a big emphasis on developing young players and improving senior stars at his disposal. He plays with a high defensive line and usually utilises a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation. Out of possession, his teams press high, making his philosophy not too far away from Klopp and the style he could inherit at Liverpool.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_jackson@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Kieran Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segunda_Divisi\u00f3n", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Segunda Divisi\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_van_den_Brom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John van den Brom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAC_Breda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NAC Breda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breda"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Breda"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_First_Division_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgian First Division A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta_Rotterdam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sparta Rotterdam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Cambuur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SC Cambuur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/54ccc6bbfe5eb4266412659c7c9cc0cf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 3359, "textEnd": 3366}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 1319, "textEnd": 1331}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 1917, "textEnd": 1930}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Is it a possibility?' he was asked.\n\n'I can't deny that,' Slot responded.\n\n'Liverpool want you though,\" Cotterill said as Slot walked away.\n\n'But tonight we are playing Go Ahead Eagles,' came the response.\n\nSlot has won the Dutch league and cup in the last couple of seasons with Feyenoord\n\nCotterill gave his good luck wishes and Slot thanked him.\n\nWith Jurgen Klopp stepping down at the end of the season, Liverpool have been looking through a carousel of managers to replace him.\n\nThe dream candidate at the beginning was Xabi Alonso, a former Red who has managed Bayer Leverkusen to their first Bundesliga title and a currently unbeaten season.\n\nHowever, with Alonso affirming his intention to stay in Germany, hearts turned to Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim, who has the Portuguese club on course for a second league title in four years.\n\nLiverpool's interest in Amorim has cooled, however, and he flew in to London for talks with West Ham earlier this week.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cotterill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Cotterill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Ahead_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Go Ahead Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johan Cruyff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

But none of them seemed especially likely.\n\nNow, on Tuesday afternoon, new filtered through that a name who was not on that list at all - Feyenoord's Arne Slot - is now the 'leading contender.'\n\nThis news will have come as quite a surprise to Liverpool fans. Slot has been mentioned sporadically throughout the search so far, but never as a prominent candidate.\n\nNevertheless, it had frequently been claimed that the Reds were prepared to be 'bold' rather than popular with their choice. So, it shouldn't be a huge shock that a left-field name has been plucked.\n\nAnd, to be honest, when you look at the reasons The Athletic put forward for Slot to be considered, we can't say it doesn't make sense.\n\nThey claim that the 45-year-old has actually filled 'many of the relevant' criteria that Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes were looking for.\n\nOne of these is said to be Slot's style of football. Described as being an 'aggressive, dominant style of play,' the Dutchman is said to be a good fit for Liverpool's current first-team squad. He also reportedly has a good track record in youth development and can demonstrate 'title-winning success' while sticking to these principles.\n\nLastly - and perhaps this will feed the critics slightly - Slot is claimed to have shown that he can achieve success without 'frivolous spending.' This one is said to be 'attractive' to FSG in particular.\n\nAll of this sounds good, but you can't get away from the fact that many Liverpool fans will be left asking 'Who is Arne Slot?' tonight. Well, let us try to give you a little bit of background.\n\nSlot, a former midfielder, spent the whole of his playing career in his native Netherlands. Never capped for his country, he retired at PEC Zwolle in 2013.\n\nFrom there, he moved to Cambuur, where he worked as an assistant and briefly and interim manager. A move to AZ Alkmaar then beckoned where Slot again worked behind the scenes before taking on the top job in 2019.\n\nHis first stint as a head coach was promising and Slot may well have led AZ to the title in 2020 were the season not prematurely ended by the Coronavirus pandemic. Slot's side were level on points with Ajax at the top when the campaign finished without awarding a winner.\n\nArne then joined Feyenoord where he has been ever since. A Europa Conference League runners-up medal in 2021/22 was followed up with Eredivisie title win the following year, and a KNVB Cup this time.

They will reportedly 'move fast' to tie up a deal to bring Slot from Feyenoord this week.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be excited about the 45-year-old, although the jury will very much be out on whether he's good enough to step into Klopp's shoes.\n\nNevertheless, Slot is now quite clearly Liverpool's first choice option. That perhaps hadn't always been the case though, as an interesting overnight update from journalist Fabrizio Romano alludes to.\n\nIt can be easy to get sucked into all the reports we've seen since the news about Slot first came out yesterday.\n\nThe tone of them has appeared to suggest that Slot was always the first choice candidate amongst the Anfield hierarchy.\n\nHowever, taking to his YouTube channel yesterday, Romano claims that Liverpool were actually talking to Ruben Amorim up until a week or ten days ago. With Amorim now said to be off the table, it would be interesting to know why.\n\n\"Between Ruben Amorim and Liverpool, what's happening?\" posed the transfer expert. \"Some media reported in recent weeks that everything was verbally agreed between Amorim and Liverpool. I'm told that this was never the case.\n\n\"Amorim had conversations and talks with Liverpool but never had an agreement with Liverpool. But now it looks difficult, unlikely. The situation is in standby already since last week. No fresh contacts between Liverpool and Amorim.\n\n\"So, active talks with Arne Slot, no direct contacts with Amorim in the last seven, ten days.\"\n\nIt's possible that we'll never really know exactly what went on between Amorim and Liverpool. In many ways, the 39-year-old seemed like the ideal appointment for the Reds.\n\nWith his Sporting team on the verge of a second league title in four years, Amorim looked poised to make the step up.\n\nIt's obviously possible that Liverpool were also talking to Slot at the same time and always preferred the Feyenoord boss. But we just don't buy that.\n\nAmorim is the outstanding candidate on paper. He must have been ahead in the running. Perhaps there was some disagreement over vision with Michael Edwards, or maybe it was a monetary issue.\n\nPerhaps one day we'll find out.

He's also claimed to have firmed up his choice for assistant manager, too.\n\nNevertheless, things aren't over the line for Slot and Liverpool just yet. And with other clubs said to be lurking for the Dutchman, the Reds reportedly have two other options on stand-by.\n\nThere have been plenty of names mentioned as FSG look to find their ideal Klopp replacement this summer. For the most part though, Slot had not really been one of them.\n\nInstead, the press have largely focused on names like Julian Nagelsmann, Ruben Amorim and Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nNow, Nagelsmann took himself out of the running last week by surprisingly extending his stay as the Germany national team manager. Amorim meanwhile had looked like the favourite, before being deemed 'unlikely' at the start of this week.\n\nThe same treatment had befallen De Zerbi several weeks earlier, with the Italian seemingly dropping out of the running.\n\nHowever, The Guardian have now written that both Amorim and De Zerbi are actually still 'under consideration' by Liverpool. Slot, it's claimed, is a 'strong candidate' but the Reds could reportedly face 'competition' for the Feyenoord manager from Bayern Munich, Barcelona and AC Milan.\n\nAs a result, Liverpool need to have some back-up options. And these would appear to be Amorim and De Zerbi. For all of the candidates, it's claimed that the Reds have not held face-to-face talks. Instead, they have been 'sounding out' potential new managers via intermediaries.\n\nThroughout the past three months or so, Liverpool have really kept people guessing as to who will follow Klopp at Anfield.\n\nBack when Jurgen announced his intention to leave in January, not many people had Slot down as the man who would take up the mantle.\n\nPlenty had suggested both Amorim and De Zerbi though, and perhaps it will still end up being one of those two managers.\n\nBut the only scenario that looks possible is if Slot is either poached by another club or decides to stay at Feyenoord. After yesterday's press briefing, Liverpool seem confident that that won't happen.\n\nOne thing appears to be certain for now, then. This is the Reds' final shortlist. Chuck all of the other names in the bin. It looks set to be Slot. If not, take your pick from Amorim or De Zerbi.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brooke@rousingthekop.com", "name": "James Brooke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

'With the way he plays and the philosophy he has, he can be a Liverpool coach.\n\n'But I read and hear that it is far from complete. We shall see. We will focus on that next season, but that is still a long way off.'\n\nLiverpool made their former midfielder Xabi Alonso their top target following Klopp's bombshell in January. The Spaniard however has committed to at least one more season at Bayer Leverkusen after leading the club to the Bundesliga title.\n\nWhile Slot is highly thought of in Netherlands with a reputation for eye-catching football and developing young stars, club legend Jamie Carragher admitted on Wednesday night he is perhaps not the most inspiring choice.\n\nWhat I would say is that Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump and I think it shows at the moment that there's probably a dearth in terms of top managers out there,' the Liverpool legend said on Sky Sports.\n\n'When you look at who Liverpool were going for initially, Xabi Alonso whose only in his first full season as a manager. There was talk of Amorim from Sporting, he's only 39. And Arne Slot looks like he's the favourite right now.\n\nI don't think it's like Rafa Benitez coming in or Jurgen Klopp coming in. Benitez came in off the back of two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup. Klopp came in off winning a couple of league titles with Borussia Dortmund and getting to a Champions League final.\n\n'And Liverpool were actually in a different space then. I was part of the team before Benitez when we were just trying to qualify for the top four. Same with Klopp when he came in.\n\n'Liverpool are in a different area now. They're actually fancying themselves to win the Premier League every season and next season the Champions League, they'll be expecting to get to the quarter-finals at least.\n\nI think it's a huge jump. But he's obviously a great coach, he's got a great track record in the clubs that he's had so far.

Now Arne Slot is the favourite.\"\n\nCarragher added: \"I don't think it's like Benitez coming in, or Klopp. Benitez coming in on the back of two LaLiga titles and a UEFA Cup, or Klopp winning a couple of league titles and getting to a Champions League final. Liverpool were actually in a different space then.\n\n\"That Liverpool team, certainly under Benitez that I was part of, we were the team trying to qualify for the top four. The same with Klopp when he came in.\n\n\"But Liverpool are in a different era now. They actually fancy themselves to challenge for the Premier League every season. Next season, in the Champions League they'd expect to get to the quarter-finals at least.\n\n\"I think it's a huge jump but he's obviously a great coach with a great track record so far. We'll see.\"\n\nMohamed Salah has again been linked with a possible move to Saudi Arabia ahead of the summer and Carragher thinks Liverpool could now be questioning whether to hang onto him or not for the first time.\n\nCarragher continued: \"There is a real discussion for the new manager about what the future holds for Mo Salah - it's the first time we've asked that question. He only has a year to go on his contract.\n\n\"He's looked a shadow of himself for a lot of this season but especially since he's come back from injury. He is Liverpool's legend, superstar, one of the all-time greats.

Liverpool, Arsenal and now Forest. It's embarrassing - Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast\n\nFinding Jurgen Klopp's successor was never going to be an easy task. The German has left big boots to fill and, while taking over the reins at Anfield may be an exciting prospect for any aspiring manager, acquiring a coach to step in to replace Klopp is seemingly proving a difficult task for sporting director Richard Hughes and CEO Michael Edwards.\n\nAfter the disappointment of missing out on Xabi Alonso, it appears Liverpool have also been dealt a blow in their bid to land Ruben Amorim as their next manager. The in-demand Sporting Lisbon boss has this week been on a flying visit to London to meet with representatives at West Ham.\n\nHe arrived in the capital on Monday and spoke with Hammers' executives about a potential deal to take over from David Moyes, according to CNN Portugal. The 39-year-old returned to Portugal on Tuesday, and was met by journalists who pressed him on his future. While he laughed off their questions, Portuguese news outlet A Bola are claiming that West Ham have offered him 'considerably more' than what Liverpool tabled.\n\nBut money isn't everything, with West Ham also set to give him the 'freedom to build his squad as he wishes'. That whole package could prove to be a big lure for the Portuguese manager and it is understood that Amorim could be available to the English club for around \u00a312.8million.\n\nThe 39-year-old has repeatedly dismissed claims that he could become the next Liverpool boss and it is now looking less likely that the Merseyside club will land him in the summer, meaning Edwards and Hughes will have to look elsewhere - but who is still in the running to succeed Klopp?\n\nWest Ham held talks with Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim on Monday in London\n\nAmorim was met by a swarm of journalists after landing back in Portugal late on Tuesday\n\nLiverpool are continuing to search for a successor to Jurgen Klopp, who will leave this summer\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nArne Slot\n\nFeyenoord boss Slot emerged a shock frontrunner to replace Klopp on Tuesday as Liverpool ramped up their search for a successor.\n\nTottenham fans, who were keen on luring the manager before hiring Ange Postecoglou last summer, were left fuming when Slot announced that he would be staying at Feyenoord this season.\n\nREAD MORE: Ruben Amorim speaks for the first time after flying to London to hold talks with West Ham about becoming their next manager - with Sporting Lisbon boss 'offered higher terms than Liverpool could offer to join the club' Advertisement\n\nIt turns out things didn't work out too badly for Spurs, despite missing out on their main target, with Ange Postecoglou joining in the summer and subsequently becoming a fan favourite at the club.\n\nAfter holding exploratory talks over a move to north London, Slot announced that he would be staying in the Netherlands - having won the Dutch Eredivisie title with Feyenoord last season.\n\nWhile he hasn't been able to repeat that feat during the 2023-24 campaign, Slot has pushed Feyenoord to second in the league standings, using his attacking and entertaining brand of football.\n\nHe is an innovative manager who understands how modern-day footballers operate - meaning he can deliver a rousing team talk or dish out a telling off, should it be required. And his tactics are similar to those that Liverpool deploy under Klopp - with the 45-year-old instructing his players to deploy an intensive man-marking strategy and win the ball back early.\n\nThere is a concern that new CEO of football Edwards may have to dip deep into his coffers to sign the Dutchman though, with Slot agreeing a three-year deal to stay at Feyenoord in May, 2023 after snubbing a move to Spurs.\n\nArne Slot's move to join Tottenham fell through last year after he decided to snub the club\n\nThere is a concern that Edwards (left) may have to dip deep into his coffers to sign Slot\n\nRoberto De Zerbi\n\nFormerly a leading contender to take the Liverpool job after Hughes, who previously worked as Bournemouth's sporting director, wanted to appoint the Italian coach as the Cherries boss.\n\nREAD MORE: Jamie Carragher believes Roberto De Zerbi is the new favourite for the Liverpool job after reports Ruben Amorim was 'unlikely' to replace Jurgen Klopp at Anfield Advertisement\n\n'Richard Hughes wanted De Zerbi at Bournemouth, so he must be the favourite if this is true,' Carragher said.\n\nDe Zerbi's success deploying a fast and entertaining brand of football at Brighton has earned him plenty of praise over the years, with the 44-year-old taking over from Graham Potter in 2022, before guiding Brighton to qualify for the Europa League last season.\n\nHe has grown in stature to becoming one of the most well-respected managers in the Premier League - and that casts some doubt over whether he would leave Brighton to join a top-flight rival - especially considering the team he has built.\n\nDavid Ornstein has also claimed that the move might not go ahead, telling The Athletic FC Podcast: 'My information is that it's incredibly unlikely that Liverpool will go for De Zerbi.'\n\nAmid the conflicting rumours, the Italian has been on Liverpool's radar at points during their search for a new manager, according to Sky Sports.\n\nConflicting rumours have emerged over whether De Zerbi would join Liverpool from Brighton\n\nThiago Motta\n\nBologna boss, Motta, is another manager who has reportedly been on Edwards and Hughes' radar of late. The former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder has plenty of experience winning trophies over the years and that will no doubt entice Liverpool into hiring him.\n\nREAD MORE: The SIX managers Man United 'are considering to replace Erik ten Hag' REVEALED - with concerns over whether Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi 'has the personality to handle the pressure' Advertisement\n\nThe 41-year-old has an impressive managerial CV too. He started his coaching journey taking charge of the PSG U19 team, before enjoying stints with Genoa and Spezia Calcio. With Bologna, the former Italy international has guided the Rossoblu up to fourth in the Serie A standings - with the club on the verge of securing Champions League football for the first time in their history next season.\n\nHis agent Alessandro Canovi, has not ruled out a move to Liverpool either, claiming that 'interesting offers' could come in the next few weeks. He told TMW Radio via Calcio Mercato: 'There are no agreements or dialogues. At the moment the only reality is that Motta has an expiring contract with Bologna.\n\n'Will he stay at Bologna? I can't say, because I don't have negotiations with anyone. We cannot talk about things that do not exist.\n\n'The situation of the big names? The confirmation of Xabi Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen has opened up several important candidates for Liverpool and Bayern Munich. As well as Barcelona. They are three interesting and highly coveted benches now.'\n\nWhile it might be unlikely that he wil leave his current club just as they secure a berth in the Champions League, Motta's agent's comments are curious to say the least.\n\nBologna boss, Motta, is another manager who has reportedly been on Liverpool's radar\n\nThomas Frank\n\nThe Dane has been touted as a managerial successor to Klopp for some time. Speculation from TeamTALK suggests that the Reds are considering the Brentford boss as a serious contender to take over from the German.\n\nHe has been at the forefront of success at the Gtech Community Stadium since he was appointed first-team coach in 2018. Frank would oversee their promotion to the top-flight in 2021, with the ever-charismatic tactician having kept Brentford in the the Premier League for the last three seasons.\n\nWhat's more is that he's established them as one of the toughest teams in the league to beat - thanks to their extreme energy around the park. He and Klopp share very similar ideas of how their teams should operate - with Frank emploring his players to run their opponents off the pitch.\n\n'There's a lot of rumours out there,' Frank said to Sky Sports in February on the links to Liverpool. 'I think we all have kind of an ego and the ego likes that little bit of sugar but at the end of the day, I'm at Brentford. I'm very happy here.'\n\n'Do I have ambitions? Yes. Am I going to stay at Brentford forever? Maybe but probably not. So who knows what's going to happen in the future? What I know is that I'm here at Brentford and I'm very happy with it.'\n\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank has been touted as a successor to Jurgen Klopp for some time\n\nThomas Tuchel\n\nCould the German make a return to the Premier League, following his disappointing exit from Chelsea in 2022?\n\nThere is some speculation that Tuchel may not fit the right persona to succeed as the Liverpool manager - with Mail Sport columnist Danny Murphy previously telling talkSPORT that the outgoing Bayern Munich boss 'is too divisive' and that 'he's not a Liverpool manager.'\n\nThis season, Bayern have conceded the German title to Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen, with Tuchel announcing that he will leave the side at the end of the season.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the former Champions League winning manager will prioritise a move back to England, putting several Premier League clubs on red alert.\n\nCould Thomas Tuchel make his Premier League return, after his exit from Chelsea in 2022?\n\nPaulo Fonseca\n\nPaulo Fonseca's Lille side suffered an agonising defeat on penalties by Aston Villa last week. It was a tough result, but the French side look set to qualify for European football again this season and go one better than their achievements in the 2022-23 campaign, by securing a berth in the Champions League qualifiers.\n\nIn the latest plot twist of Liverpool's manager hunt, speculation is growing that the Portuguese coach is the latest candidate to be added to Liverpool's managerial shortlist.\n\nHe possesses plenty of experience having worked at big clubs across Europe, including Shakhtar, Roma and Porto. He had also been on the verge of a move to Tottenham in 2021, but that deal fell through because then-sporting director Fabio Paratici wanted Spurs to play a little more defensively.\n\nLille manager Fonseca is the latest coach to have been linked with the Liverpool post\n\n'I have some principles,' Fonseca said on his failed move to Spurs. 'I wanted to be coach of the great teams but I want the right project and a club where the people believe in my ideas, my way to play, and this didn't happen with the managing director.'\n\nPerhaps joining Liverpool could be the right project for him?", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They came fifth, the same number of points from the top of the table as they were from the bottom three, with the football under Dick Advocaat very uninspiring.\n\nTwo years later, the Rotterdam club were champions, having spent virtually the whole season leading the Eredivisie. It was a remarkable turnaround which prompted a succession of English clubs to seek to secure his services.\n\nCrystal Palace were among them, as were Leeds, who had Slot on their list of possible replacements for Jesse Marsch in February 2023 and held talks with him in the Netherlands. Those discussions did not develop.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, thought they had persuaded him to move to north London in May 2023, with Feyenoord apparently resigned to losing him until Slot surprisingly decided to stay put. Spurs turned to Ange Postecoglou instead.\n\nAlmost a year on, and Slot's stock has continued to rise. Feyenoord have not been able to defend their Eredivisie title but they have only been denied by a remarkable campaign by PSV, who have lost just once all season. Slot's side have only been beaten twice in the league - and not at all since December 3 - and won the Dutch Cup last weekend.\n\nNow it has emerged that Slot is a leading contender for the Liverpool job which will be vacated by Jurgen Klopp this summer.\n\nBut why is he attracting such interest - and who exactly is he?\n\nArne Slot was slow.\n\nAs a player, Slot was a perfectly decent midfielder, with the bulk of his appearances coming in the Dutch second tier. He was technically very good, usually playing as an attacking midfielder or No 10 but, in the words of his former team-mate Edwin de Graaf, he was \"not so fast\". Slot the coach once said that he would not have picked Slot the player.\n\nThis meant he had to rely on others around him to do a lot of the running. \"I was a hard worker, he was the more technical player,\" says De Graaf, who played alongside him at NAC Breda.\n\nBut his limitations as a player have helped him become the coach he is today because they enhanced his appreciation of how to make a team function as a cohesive unit. He was living proof that one player cannot do his job unless a colleague is doing theirs.\n\nHe was always going to be a coach, moving from the playing squad to the coaching staff at PEC Zwolle immediately after his retirement.\n\n\"Some players you can see are going to be coaches,\" says De Graaf. \"I also played with Alfred Schreuder (the former Ajax manager) and both him and Slot... nobody is surprised now they're both coaches.\n\n\"He would ask the coach why they were using certain tactics. And in the dressing room, he would talk to the group about (for example) a way of pressing or defending. He would ask: 'Why were we doing it this way? Would it be better to do it this way?'. He would make suggestions to his coaches.\n\n\"But he would do it in such a good way. He wouldn't do it with an attitude: he would ask the coach: 'What do you think about this?'. He would also very quickly see what the opponents were doing.\"\n\n\"At that time, he was already looking in an analytical way,\" Henk ten Cate, who brought Slot to Breda, told Voetbal International in 2022. \"He was busy with tactics and asked questions at training.\"\n\nIt is worth noting this was not when Slot was in the twilight of his career and was worrying about what would come next. Slot and Ten Cate worked together in 2002-03 when Slot was 24. He was one of those players who used his time on the pitch as an extended apprenticeship for when he moved to the touchline.\n\nSlot hung up his boots in 2013 after playing for PEC Zwolle and immediately joined the club's youth academy as a coach.\n\nHe then spent three years as a coach at Cambuur, who had just been promoted to the Eredivisie, after which he moved to AZ Alkmaar to be assistant to manager John van den Brom, still only 39 when he took that job. \"We always searched for young, new coaches,\" says Van den Brom. \"He was an interesting coach because he wanted to develop.\"\n\nIt was during these years Slot clarified what sort of football he wanted to play, helped by a series of formative relationships with other coaches.\n\nAt AZ, there was Van den Brom and Pascal Jansen (who managed AZ for four years), while at Cambuur he worked closely with Marcel Keizer, who would go on to manage Ajax and Sporting Lisbon. He also shared ideas with Pep Ljinders, now Klopp's assistant at Liverpool, and, with a group of other coaches, created a bespoke player database. At the time, the data resources available to them were far from adequate, so they built their own.\n\n\"What was nice for me is that he always thought in an attacking way,\" says Van den Brom, before mentioning something that comes up time and again whenever you speak to someone about Slot.\n\n\"(His focus was) how can we make it clear to the players how we want to play? We were always searching for different ideas.\"\n\nIt is fine for a coach to have ideas, but they have to be clearly transmitted to the players. Slot's biggest quality and one he places significant emphasis on -- he believes only 60 per cent is the idea and 40 per cent is how clearly you explain it -- is his ability to communicate. His ideas are projected onto the pitch because his thoughts are clear and his words are carefully chosen.\n\nSo what are those ideas?\n\n\"They're very attacking, very aggressive, with a lot of pressing,\" says Martijn Krabbendam, a journalist for Voetbal International who has covered Slot's Feyenoord. \"High intensity, a lot of energy, and they can only do that if they're very fit.\n\n\"He always wants to play attacking football, he always wants possession, he always wants a good set-up from the goalkeeper to find free space and free players in the midfield. It's no secret he is crazy about Guardiola -- he's an example.\"\n\nVan den Brom adds: \"We used a lot of videos of Manchester City and Bayern -- he was crazy about Pep. How his teams create space, how they attack.\"\n\nGuardiola is the name that keeps coming up, but Slot also takes inspiration from a variety of other coaches: Marcelo Bielsa, Jorge Sampaoli, Jurgen Klopp, Luciano Spaletti, Mikel Arteta. All have their own ideas, so does he, but one thing they all have in common is their intensity.\n\nBefore he became Breda coach, De Graaf spent a week with Slot at Feyenoord, observing how he works. \"Every session is with high intensity,\" he says. \"Every workout, passing drill, or five vs five -- everything is with high intention and everything is with an idea. Every player knows exactly what he wants from them. He's good at making clear why he's doing certain exercises.\n\n\"He's as honest as possible, so the players really like him.\"\n\nSlot believes his teams have to be intense because it essentially gives them two ways to win: if the quality of their play is lower than that of their opponents or they are having an off day, they can win by outrunning and outworking whoever they are playing.\n\nThere is also a recognition of, and mitigation against, the fitness concerns that come with such an intense style of not just playing, but training. He works closely with his data and fitness teams: when they tell him a player's numbers are dropping or they are in the 'red zone', he will ease off.\n\nTransitions are quick and passing is certain. Slot likes to work with younger players who are keen to learn. \"If you have a young group, then, as a trainer, you can take the boys through videos in your desired playing style,\" he said a few years ago.\n\nFor example, when Tyrell Malacia left Feyenoord in 2022 for Manchester United, he chose to replace him at left-back with the 20-year-old youth team product Quilindschy Hartman. When he needed a central midfielder, he took 22-year-old Mats Wieffer from Excelsior Rotterdam in the Dutch second tier. Both were subsequently called up to the Dutch national team. Most of the key players in Feyenoord's title-winning season were aged 24 and under.\n\nHis focus is on the collective. He believes the team makes the individual look good.\n\nMost of all, the priority is on entertaining football. The goal is not to win at any cost, but to provide exciting, as well as winning, football. Voetbal International wrote: \"He believes that special football is more remembered than a prize with boring, uninspiring football.\"\n\nPlayers seem to adore Slot.\n\nOussama Idrissi, who played a key part in Slot's teams at both AZ and Feyenoord, was asked last year by the Dutch newspaper AD where Slot ranks in the coaches he has played under. \"For me, he's the best,\" said the Moroccan winger. \"He can develop players and make teams play fun football.\"\n\nWhen it was pointed out that he has also played under Julen Lopetegui, Herve Renard and a guy called Erik ten Hag, Idrissi reiterated: \"Slot was the best.\"\n\nYou will not struggle to find other players with similarly effusive things to say about him. \"He is one of the best managers I've ever seen,\" said Alireza Jahanbakhsh, the Iranian forward currently playing under Slot at Feyenoord. \"In football terms, even the best. At the moment, he is the best in the Netherlands.\"\n\nReiss Nelson spent the 2021-22 season on loan at Feyenoord, becoming a regular in the second half of the campaign. \"Arne Slot is a great manager,\" he told the Colney Carpool podcast. \"He really got me into my rhythm. He gave me a lot of opportunities to play and I excelled.\"\n\n\"It's a shame,\" said Myron Boadu, shortly after Slot left AZ. \"Arne is a fantastic person and a fantastic trainer who really let us play football in the style of Manchester City or Barcelona in the good times.\"\n\n\"He's as honest as possible, so the players really like him,\" says De Graaf.\n\nSlot has not gained the backing of these players just by being straightforward, though. The players like him because they win under him. But, perhaps more than that, they follow him because most of the things he tells them come true.\n\n\"Before playing Marseille (in the Europa Conference League semi-finals in 2022), during training he told his midfielders to play long balls out to the wingers, over the top,\" explains Krabbendam. \"(Orkun) Kokcu, the midfielder, was so tired of it -- he asked: 'Why do we have to keep playing these long balls?'. Slot said he would explain later.\n\n\"In 20 minutes, Feyenoord were up 2-0 and both goals came from long balls behind the Marseille defence. He knew that was a weakness of Marseille. If you speak to the Feyenoord players -- and it doesn't matter which players -- they will tell you that whatever this coach says, it happens. It's remarkable. They have blind confidence in him because what he says comes true.\"\n\nHe is no hardliner or a particular disciplinarian. He emphasises positivity. When his video analysts put selections of clips together for players to watch, allowing them to scrutinise their own performances, he asks that most of them are positive. In particular, the last one is always positive so the players leave their session feeling good about themselves.\n\nArguably, the player who most benefitted from Slot's tenure at Feyenoord was Kokcu, who came through the ranks at Feyenoord.\n\nPreviously regarded as a talented but slightly insubstantial No 10, Kokcu came back from Euro 2020 with Turkey to find things had changed. No longer would he be able to create and let his team-mates do his running for him.\n\nAfter Slot's first competitive game in charge, a Europa Conference League game against Kosovan side SF Drita, the new coach sat down next to Kokcu on the flight home and explained that he needed more from him. More running, more pressing, more chasing back. And it worked.\n\nEven after only a few weeks of working together, Slot convinced Kokcu that he had to significantly improve physically.\n\nKokcu is close friends with Malacia (the two came through the Feyenoord youth team together) and had observed the defender's physical development since he started working with a physical trainer in Rotterdam. Kokcu went to the same trainer and, within weeks, had become the worker Slot demanded.\n\n\"If you see him now, he's a modern midfield player,\" says Krabbendam.\n\nTo illustrate this point, take a look at this touch chart for Kokcu in Feyenoord's Europa League quarter-final first-leg victory over Roma in April 2023. The concentration is in the middle, but there are very few areas of the pitch he did not cover.\n\nThe disruption to football caused by COVID-19 produced many 'what ifs', but there cannot be many bigger than for Slot.\n\nIn his first season as AZ head coach, they had already beaten Feyenoord and PSV 3-0 and 4-0 away respectively before a 2-0 win at Ajax in March 2020 put them level on points at the top of the Eredivisie with the Amsterdam giants. There were still nine games remaining but AZ had the momentum.\n\nThe following week, the season was suspended as the pandemic took hold. The campaign was ultimately cancelled completely in April and the chance to win just the third title in AZ's history was scuppered.\n\nThey started the following season in similar style, going undefeated until the start of December. Then it all ended quite abruptly.\n\nFeyenoord announced that veteran manager Advocaat would be leaving at the end of that campaign. Slot was the obvious replacement but, a few days later, the AZ board got wind of talks between Slot and the Rotterdam club and promptly sacked him. He was clearly ready for a step up, but it was far from the way he wanted to leave the club.\n\n\"You always want to leave by the front door,\" says Van den Brom. \"So it wasn't good for Arne and it wasn't good for the club.\"\n\nHe spent the intervening months playing golf and planning for the move.\n\nIt worked. The improvement in Feyenoord's football -- and results -- was almost instant, moving from a distant fifth to a closer third, scoring more goals, conceding fewer and winning more games. They also reached the Europa Conference League final, where they lost to Roma. Slot won the Rinus Michels award for best coach in the Eredivisie.\n\nIf you want to quantify Feyenoord's improvement under Slot, consider FiveThirtyEight's Soccer Power Index, which uses underlying metrics to calculate a team's attacking and defensive strength. Slot's arrival at the club coincided with a steady rise up the rankings, peaking on a score of 76.6, the 21st-highest in world football. Not bad for an Eredivisie club.\n\nBut here is perhaps the most compelling evidence that Slot has something.\n\nIn the summer after that first season, his Feyenoord team was gutted. Top scorer Luis Sinisterra was sold to Leeds. Malacia went to United. Marcos Senesi to Bournemouth. Nelson's loan spell ended and he returned to Arsenal. Midfielder Fredrik Aursnes joined Benfica. Guus Til (on loan at Feyenoord from Spartak Moscow) moved to PSV. All four players who had chalked up double-figure goal tallies the previous season had left.\n\nAnd yet, Feyenoord improved. Kokcu and a few others stayed, but in came Santiago Gimenez, who has gone on to be their top scorer. Slovakian defender David Hancko arrived from Sparta Prague and excelled. Idrissi, who starred for Slot at AZ, was rescued from Sevilla on loan. Wieffer and Hartman were essentially plucked from nowhere and are now full internationals.\n\nThey took top spot in the Eredvisie just before the World Cup break and did not relinquish it.\n\nPSV may have deposed them this season but there is no sense that there has been a significant drop-off in performances: Feyenoord could yet surpass their league-winning points tally from last season of 82.\n\nSlot is revered for winning just Feyenoord's second Eredivisie title since the turn of the century, and he now has Champions League experience - albeit he was unable to lead the club out of the group stage, despite beating Lazio and Celtic.\n\nLiverpool's interest is understandable. Any club that wants a young, forward-thinking coach who prioritises fast, intense, attacking football would be foolish not to take a look.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news",

Arne Slot seems to be inching closer to be appointed as the club's new manager.\n\nHe is very much the favourite for the Liverpool job at this stage, and it seems likely that he will be in the dugout for the club next season.\n\nIt's an interesting appointment for Liverpool. Slot is not a well-known name in English football, but he does have an excellent track record in the Netherlands. He's playing style also very closely resembles Jurgen Klopp's.\n\nLike Klopp Slot's football is focused on high intensity. He wants his players to press forward and create overloads all over the pitch.\n\nExpect Liverpool to play a very similar kind of pressing football under Slot next season. This definitely won't change from Klopp's tenure.\n\nBut there are key differences in the way Slot likes to play football as well. His build-up is a lot more controlled. Meanwhile, in the final third Feyenoord are known to play quick incisive passes, and are very good at breaking down opponents.\n\nSlot also traditionally plays with a slight variance to Klopp's 4-3-3 formation. Slot's formation is probably more closer to a 4-2-3-1 with two deep lying midfielders and one more advanced one.\n\nIn terms of how Liverpool could line-up, there won't be too many changes at the back. Alisson Becker will be in goal. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konate, Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson will make up the back four.\n\nIn midfield, it would not be a surprise to see Slot bring in another holding midfielder. However, at this current moment in time, the two deep lying roles suit Alexis Mac Allister and Wataru Endo the best.\n\nMeanwhile, the more advanced midfielder could be Dominik Szoboszlai or Harvey Elliott.\n\nUp top, expect the likes of Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota to maintain very similar roles in the front three.\n\nIn terms of where Slot may look to strengthen, it would not be a surprise to see him bring in a left-sided centre-back.\n\nDavid Hancko is someone who has done very well under the Dutch manager, and he's been followed by Liverpool as well so he is an obvious choice.\n\nAs mentioned above, Slot could also look at bringing in a holding midfielder. But the Reds could also strengthen at left-back, and depending on what happens with the club's attackers, they may also be in the market for a new player for the forward line.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Dutch Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/04/GettyImages-2147982484-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 1415, "textEnd": 1422}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

However, Slot does seem like an ideal fit.\n\nHe's affable with the media, plays an exciting brand of football and is still relatively young in his coaching career.\n\nThat's pretty much every box ticked in terms of the main criteria of what Liverpool fans want to see at Anfield.\n\nIt may be obvious to some, but if Arne Slot is appointed as Liverpool's new manager, it's looking like he will bring some of his own coaching staff from Feyenoord with him.\n\nThis could include his current assistant manager, Sipke Hulshoff. The pair have known each other and have worked together during their time at SC Cambuur back in 2016.\n\nHulshoff is currently Slot's assistant manager at Feyenoord and he is highly regarded. He's also working as an assistant manager for the Dutch national team, so he's already got experience training with the likes of Cody Gakpo and Virgil van Dijk as well.\n\nIf Slot becomes Liverpool manager, we should expect some changes in the playing squad as well. Not everyone will fit into Slot's philosophy.\n\nSome players may want to leave. Others may be brought in as well. However, given Slot doesn't differ too much in terms of his preferred formation and style to Klopp, there won't be major changes afoot.\n\nSlot's appointment means continuity, which is exactly what Liverpool wanted. He will ensure things will operate in relatively the same way and that will give the club's players massive assurances as well.\n\nFinally, we will put an end to the longstanding saga that has gone on for the last few months. Liverpool will be able to focus on merely on field matters.\n\nFSG's and Michael Edwards' attention meanwhile will turn towards the promise of finding a new club to bring under the ownership's umbrella.\n\nThat has been the target since Edwards returned to work under FSG, and we should see more movement on that once the important things have been settled when it comes to Klopp's replacement.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Cambuur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SC Cambuur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/04/GettyImages-2148002473-3-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

After all the talk of Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim, it seems like Liverpool have had their eyes on Slot all along.\n\nIt's an interesting and perhaps surprising choice at first glance. However, under the microscope, it's a choice that makes absolute sense for Liverpool.\n\nSlot's high intensity gegenpressing playing style is eerily reminiscent of the way Jurgen Klopp likes to play at Liverpool.\n\nIn this way, there won't be too much overwhelming change for Liverpool's players. Slot very much means continuity for the club.\n\nOf course, Slot's isn't identical to Klopp. He will make minor changes at the club. His formation and system isn't completely the same as Klopp.\n\nOne of the key variances is that Slot likes to play a double pivot in midfield, and use a more advanced midfielder as a number ten. In this sense, he very much plays a triangle midfield, which is a little bit different compared to Klopp's diamond.\n\nBut it's a system that could suit someone like Alexis Mac Allister really well. He is pretty much tailor made to play in a double pivot and could thrive with the way Slot wants his players to make quick and incisive passes.\n\nAnother player who could absolutely flourish in this new midfield shape under Slot is Dominik Szoboszlai. The Hungarian is a typical number ten and in this system he will be able to play in a more advanced role where he could bring out his qualities in the final third.\n\nGiven the fact that Szoboszlai is also a pressing machine, he will also really suit the way Slot wants his players to press really high up the pitch.\n\nFor Liverpool's young players, Slot's appointment is also a massive advantage for their development. Slot likes to play young players, and he has always played with a really young team both at AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord.\n\nThis means youngster will get plenty of opportunities under Slot. Among them, the one who could benefit the most is Bobby Clark.\n\nHe's probably been one of the more impressive players who has broken through from the academy into the first team this season.\n\nLike Szoboszlai, Clark is pretty much tailor made for that number ten role in Slot's system, and he could be getting plenty of opportunities under Liverpool's new potential boss if Slot is appointed.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ciaran Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Baccarat", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Baccarat", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/04/GettyImages-2148002961-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Serbian Football Scout suggests Slot may target Benfica's Orkun Kokcu, a midfielder with impressive stats in Portugal. Teun Koopmeiners could also be on Slot's radar in the summer transfer window.\n\nLiverpool are pushing to appoint Feyenoord manager Arne Slot to replace Jurgen Klopp this summer, and Serbian Football Scout on X has suggested that he wouldn't be surprised to see the Dutch manager look to target Orgun Kokcu.\n\nWith Klopp announcing earlier in the season that he would be heading through the exit door at the end of the campaign, the decision-makers at Liverpool are now searching for his replacement. It's a vital period for the Merseyside club as they look to shape their future under a new regime.\n\nAccording to Paul Joyce of The Times, the Reds have now opened negotiations with Feyenoord to attempt to thrash out a deal to bring Slot to Anfield. It appears that the 45-year-old is now a leading contender for the soon-to-be vacant position.\n\nLiverpool Could Target Orkun Kokcu He has a good relationship with Arne Slot\n\nPosting on X, Serbian Football Scout has discussed who Slot could look to sign if he moves to Liverpool in the summer. One player he suggests that he wouldn't be surprised to see follow the Dutch manager to Anfield is Benfica midfielder Kokcu...\n\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if he went for Kokcu. He's the midfielder dropping deep in the clip above. They were really close and he knows how to best use him.\n\nFormer Liverpool player Mohamed Sissoko once described Kokcu as the next Luka Modric before he made the move to Portugal. The Reds are unlikely to be able to secure him at a bargain price, with Benfica inserting a release clause of around \u00a3130m in his contract.\n\nLiverpool underwent a major midfield overhaul during the previous summer transfer window, with Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo, Ryan Gravenberch, and Alexis Mac Allister all arriving through the door. Despite the numbers they have in the middle of the park, Slot will likely want to bring in some of his own players.\n\nWhether Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards would allow Slot to identify and recruit new additions is another story, with the backroom duo likely to have a major say in recruitment this summer. Allowing a manager to have too much influence on transfers can be an issue at times, so it will be interesting to see how their summer window plays out if Slot is appointed.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Orkun Kokcu has scored five goals and provided seven assists in 23 games for Benfica in the league this season.\n\nRelated Who is Arne Slot - Dutch Manager Now Favourite For Liverpool Job A closer look at Arne Slot, the Dutch manager who has emerged as the new favourite to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. Slot Could Bring in Koopmeiners for Liverpool He once appointed him as captain\n\nJournalist Bence Bocsak has also claimed that Teun Koopmeiners could be a player that Slot considers advising the recruitment team to bring in if he arrives at Anfield. The Dutch midfielder thrived under the guidance of the Feyenoord coach while he was also made captain by Slot.\n\nKoopmeiners could be utilised in a deeper midfield role if he was to make the switch to Merseyside. Although Endo arrived in the summer, he's reaching the latter stages of his career, so the Reds will need to find a long-term replacement.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Transfermarkt", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teun_Koopmeiners", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teun Koopmeiners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Following January's shock news that Jurgen Klopp will depart as Liverpool manager at the end of the current season, the Reds are on the lookout to find his long-term replacement.\n\nThe Carabao Cup winners have a monumental task on their hands trying to find the German's successor and whoever takes on the hotseat has huge shoes to fill at Anfield. Previously looking like former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso would return to Merseyside going on his fine work in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen, the Spaniard recently committed his future to the Bundesliga club and that has left everyone questioning who will win the race for the Liverpool job over the coming weeks.\n\nTottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou was previously mentioned in regards to the hotseat after making a wonderful start to his Premier League career following his Celtic exit. Quizzed in press conferences about the speculation and the fact that he supported Liverpool growing up, the Australian quickly dismissed all the talk of a move north.\n\nSporting CP boss Ruben Amorim, who was previously linked with replacing Antonio Conte at Tottenham prior to Postecoglou's appointment, has been tipped to become the Reds' next manager but he is now no longer the favourite with the bookmakers to be appointed. It is Feyenoord's Arne Slot who has seen his odds slashed dramatically over the past 24 hours to become favourite having been a 50/1 outsider previously.\n\nTottenham supporters will be well aware of Slot's work in Rotterdam as he looked on course to replace Conte at the helm almost one year ago. Having transformed his Feyenoord side following a major rebuild and managed to guide them to the Europa Conference League final in his first season at the club, the 45-year-old led his players to the Eredivisie title twelve months later.\n\nDoing so by playing an attractive brand of football and developing youth team players and his signings in the transfer market, it was no surprise why Tottenham were interested in securing Slot's services in their quest to get back to their previous heights. Spurs themselves needed to undergo a major rebuild and the Dutchman appeared to be the perfect candidate going on his fine work in Rotterdam.\n\nREAD MORE: Tottenham face Son Heung-min dilemma for Arsenal North London Derby as Postecoglou makes changes\n\nREAD MORE: Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham wildcard option vs Arsenal has big Radu Dragusin benefit\n\nThere was to be a twist in the tale, though. Odds-on to swap Feyenoord for Tottenham and looking on the verge of departing De Kuip, Slot instead produced a U-turn and penned a new contract with the Dutch club to extend his Feyenoord stay. It was a decision that only plunged Spurs' managerial search into even more chaos.\n\nSince electing to remain with the Eredivisie side, Slot has once again had Feyenoord challenging at the top of the league but they are on course to lose their crown with PSV holding a nine-point advantage over them with four games remaining. Their Champions League campaign unfortunately came to an early end after finishing third in a group containing Atletico Madrid, Lazio and Celtic, with a Europa League exit then following in February after losing on penalties to Roma in the knockout round play-offs.\n\nSlot has managed to lead Feyenoord to another piece of silverware, though, after his team secured a 1-0 win over NEC Nijmegen in the KNVB Cup final on Sunday evening. That could well be his last trophy in Rotterdam if he is to make the move to the Premier League one year on from all the Tottenham speculation.\n\nWhoever replaces Klopp at Liverpool has an incredibly tough act to follow. It's no surprise to see why Slot's odds for the job have tumbled by some way over the past couple of days given what he's achieved with Feyenoord.\n\nCompleting a successful rebuild of the club and implementing an attacking-brand of football that is easy on the eye, Slot is also not afraid to put his trust in youth, something which will no doubt please Reds fans given the likes of Conor Bradley who have starred for the first team recently. Slot is also someone who has enjoyed great success in the transfer market and managed to take players - both current ones and new signings - to greater heights.\n\nWhile it may be Klopp in the Anfield dugout for one last time when Tottenham visit Anfield at the start of May, it could be a familiar name in Slot in charge of the Reds when Spurs make the trip to Merseyside next campaign. Time will tell if that is to be the case.\n\nWant breaking and top Tottenham stories sent straight to you? Join our Spurs WhatsApp community by clicking this link.

I'm impressed. He can be the right one to fill the Slot Klopp left.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old, who only signed a new two-year deal at the Rotterdam-based club in May, has previously hinted at a possible move.\n\n\"My next step will not be a club in Holland,\" he said in May 2023.\n\n\"If that is my next step, then I've failed completely.

That bid was rejected.\n\nWith another reportedly set to come on Thursday, FSG are seemingly pushing hard to wrap a deal up before the end of the season.\n\nAnd although it looks likely that they'll be able to do that, nothing is certain just yet. With other top clubs also claimed to be circling Slot, nobody at Liverpool should be counting their chickens. And, as it turns out, the Reds do indeed appear to have a back-up plan.\n\nPrior to Slot being named as the new favourite to take over at Anfield, Ruben Amorim had looked like the outstanding candidate.\n\nThe 39-year-old is even said to have tried to 'put pressure' on Liverpool to hire him by engaging in talks with West Ham earlier this week.\n\nBut, unmoved, it seems as though the Reds might have actually discounted Amorim from consideration altogether.\n\nThe same though cannot be said for Brentford boss Thomas Frank. According to Tipsbladet - an outlet from Frank's native Denmark - the 50-year-old has been under consideration by Liverpool 'for a long time.'\n\nThere is even said to have been an interview take place between Frank's representatives and the Reds' decision makers.\n\nUltimately though, it's noted that Liverpool have opted to move forward with Slot instead. Given the paper's insistence that Frank was a 'serious candidate' to replace Klopp though, it might be wise to now install him as an official back-up.\n\nFrank's name has been in the mix more or less ever since Klopp announced his decision to leave three months ago.\n\nThe Dane has done a superb job at Brentford and looks set to keep them in the Premier League for a third season running.\n\nA positive and charismatic figure, you can understand why Frank would appeal to Liverpool. But it's also true that he has won nothing at all as a manager.\n\nAlthough his knowledge of English football could be a bonus, his lack of a trophy-winning track record will count against the former Brondby boss.\n\nFor now, it's rightly all eyes on Slot.

The Dutchman, who previously declined Spurs before the London club appointed Ange Postecoglou, is on track to follow last season's title win with a second-place finish behind PSV Eindhoven this term.\n\nThe returning Michael Edwards is expected to play a significant role in any summer transfer business, but Klopp had input during Edwards' previous tenure. Slot has managed substantial player turnover over the past 12 months, similar to Klopp's midfield overhaul at Anfield, and he understands how to integrate starters into a team.\n\nSince the summer of 2023, Feyenoord has signed more than 10 players - either permanently or on loan. Here, we examine the last 10 to give Liverpool fans an idea of what they might expect if the 45 year old takes over.\n\nREAD MORE: What goal difference means for Liverpool in title race after Arsenal earn 'extra point' advantage\n\nREAD MORE: I shouldn't have played in infamous Merseyside derby - It was my second Liverpool appearance and we finished with nine men\n\nAnis Hadj Moussa.\n\nSlot's most recent signing is a player who hasn't actually joined Feyenoord yet. Algerian forward Hadj Moussa will arrive in the summer, just a few months after making his Eredivisie debut on loan at Vitesse.\n\nThe 22 year old has two goals and two assists in all competitions in the Netherlands, having begun the season in the Belgian second tier. His arrival suggests a willingness to back a player of limited top level experience as long as the promise is there.\n\nMikki van Sas.\n\nAnother youngster, Van Sas joined from Manchester City's academy in September. The 20 year old goalkeeper has yet to make his senior Feyenoord debut, but has been on the bench in the Champions League and Europa League this term.\n\nThe Dutch Under-19 international revealed upon his unveiling that he had been scouted by the Rotterdam club as a teen. Previous rejections appear to be no barrier to deals further down the line.\n\nLuka Ivanusec.\n\nThe first name on the list to have represented Feyenoord at the time of writing, Ivanusec joined from Dinamo Zagreb in his homeland of Croatia. The winger played three times for his country at Euro 2020, showing Slot is prepared to add more experienced figures when the price is right.\n\nArriving for just \u00a36.7m (according to Transfermarkt), Ivanusec has struggled with injury this season but has still managed 20 league outings. He scored a hat-trick for Dinamo in Champions League qualifying, but has only netted once in the Eredivisie.\n\nOndrej Lingr.\n\nLingr, 25, joined on a season-long loan from Slavia Prague in August. Another full international, the attacking midfielder arrived with a record of contributing goals from a withdrawn role, with successive double-figure seasons in the Czech Republic.\n\nHe has been used out wide as well as in the number 10 role, but Slot has so far been sparing with him. All 21 of Lingr's outings have come from the bench, with the manager prepared to let the new man work for his first start.\n\nBart Nieuwkoop.\n\nDutch defender Nieuwkoop arrived from Union SG, where he spent last season linking up with Brighton winger Simon Adingra. The 28 year old started out at Feyenoord, failing to hold down a first-team place, but Slot has been prepared to give him a second chance.\n\nWhile the first half of his season was interrupted by injury, Nieuwkoop has featured more since the turn of the year. He made four appearances in the run to KNVB Cup glory, starting the victory over NEC in the final.\n\nKostas Lamprou.\n\nLamprou is another player who demonstrates Slot's willingness to offer second chances. The Greek goalkeeper returned to De Kuip nine years after departing, having done the rounds in the top two tiers of Dutch football.\n\nLiverpool boss Klopp hasn't been afraid to add experienced backup keepers on a free, with Adrian and Alex Manninger among those brought to Anfield during his tenure. With the former out of contract this summer, might there be room for another similar deal?\n\nAyase Ueda.\n\nUeda, the priciest signing on the list, was still a relatively reasonable acquisition at \u00a36.9m. The Japanese international was part of his nation's 2022 World Cup squad but wasn't one of the standout names - instead, he was a rising star when he made the move to Rotterdam.\n\nLike several others, the forward has primarily been used as a substitute despite netting 22 goals in Belgium the previous season, scoring twice in less than 500 Eredivisie minutes. However, he had a breakout Asian Cup, finishing the tournament as his country's top scorer with four goals in as many starts.\n\nCalvin Stengs.\n\nWhen Dutch international Stengs left Slot's AZ for Nice in 2021, he was highly sought after. His time in Ligue 1 didn't quite go as planned, but Slot wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to reunite with the 25 year old.\n\nThis season, Stengs has reached double figures for assists, with only PSV duo Luuk de Jong and Joey Veerman outdoing him. He also has five league goals - plus one in the Champions League victory over Celtic - suggesting the reunion has been successful so far.\n\nThomas Beelen.\n\nYoung defender Beelen cost Feyenoord just \u00a32.3m, emerging from the same PEC Zwolle production line that produced current Liverpool defender Sepp van den Berg. A tall centre-back, just as Klopp prefers them, the 22 year old has played in more than half of Feyenoord's matches this season.\n\nLiverpool will have to make some tough calls at centre-back, particularly regarding whether to offer Joel Matip a new contract and how to handle Virgil van Dijk as he enters the last year of his current deal. Klopp has shown no fear in placing trust in young players, and Slot is no exception.\n\nYankuba Minteh.\n\nOn the topic of youth, 19 year old Minteh has received support despite his young age. Liverpool may not need to dip into the pool of top teams' young talent, but Gambia international Minteh has had a successful season on loan from Newcastle.\n\nWith nine league goals to his name, the winger is second only to Premier League-linked Santiago Gimenez in the club's scoring charts. Liverpool has reaped significant benefits from goals scored from wide positions, which could be music to the ears of fans.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

But the 45-year-old is a leading contender to take over from J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Anfield.\n\nWith an attack-minded, high-intensity playing style and a track record of getting the most out of his resources, Slot has impressed the Liverpool hierarchy. And his record in the Eredivisie, where he won the title last season, is also exceptional.\n\nBut what might Liverpool look like if Slot does take over? The Reds squad looks well-suited to the system that he uses at the moment, where the principles are broadly similar to what Klopp and his staff have instilled.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot already had say on J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Liverpool and hinted at next move\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool may be set to pile pressure on Pep Guardiola as Man City disadvantage clear\n\nFeyenoord mainly uses a 4-2-3-1 system, which is subtly different from how Liverpool sets up. Klopp uses one number six (Wataru End\u014d or Alexis Mac Allister) where Slot usually goes with a double pivot, though the Dutchman could adapt.\n\nWho could benefit most if he does go with a double pivot? Mac Allister played in that role for Brighton (and has for Argentina) and it could suit Ryan Gravenberch too. He was used to playing in that way for Ajax and Bayern Munich.\n\nEnd\u014d might benefit from having someone alongside him as well when the Japanese plays there. His energy levels have been good this season but the older he gets, the more help he might end up needing.\n\nHarvey Elliott and Curtis Jones might suit playing wide (or as a number 10) in a 4-2-3-1 system, and Dominik Szoboszlai could do that comfortably as well. But there would be a question mark with those three when you factor in the attacking options that Slot would have to work with. Mohamed Salah and Luis D\u00edaz would have to play wide.\n\nUltimately, one of the appealing factors with Slot would be that his system would not be massively different from how Liverpool plays now. Considering the number of midfield options that the Reds have, he could reconfigure that part of the pitch within his attacking masterplan to fit more of them in.\n\nOr Slot could have four out of five senior forwards on the pitch in an ultra-attacking version of the formation that he currently favors. Both options would be on the table without changing much from what he does in the Netherlands at the moment.\n\nThere would still be questions about how certain positions change from the Klopp era. Most notably, what would Slot want Trent Alexander-Arnold to do? He could easily play as part of a midfield pivot, but he basically does that anyway at the moment from full-back, giving Liverpool an additional option in possession.\n\nBut broadly speaking, the attacking concepts and the full-throttle counter-press would continue. It would be the specifics of each role that needed to be worked out rather than a complete redesign of the set-up -- and much less disruptive, for example, than moving to a back three, for instance.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_addison@liverpool.com", "name": "Matt Addison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Gravenberch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Gravenberch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Dutch Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29048868.ece/alternates/s1200/0_gettyimages-2149585031.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 852, "textEnd": 859, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

You could maybe say that that Jurgen is a bit more direct.\n\nArne Slot likes to build and play a little bit more football through the whole pitch, whereas maybe Klopp you could argue, he's maybe more direct.\n\nWhat I like about Slot is that he likes to play his game and the pressing game wherever he plays and against anyone. So it doesn't matter if he plays, let's say Real Madrid away or whatever game, he plays his style. And that is something I think Liverpool fans will like a lot.\n\nHe's a big fan of Guardiola, so I would say his style even more towards Guardiola [than Klopp], although I guess with Guardiola and Klopp they'd both like their teams to have the ball to attack.\n\nHe's a huge admirer of of Guardiola. He [Slot] said: \"Pep Guardiola gives me the ultimate joy in football.\n\n\"There is no team in the world I would rather watch than Manchester City, followed by Napoli, Arsenal and Brighton.\n\n\"But City - and again it is not my intention to compare us with them - have a similar style of play to how we want to play with Feyenoord: 4-3-3, building up from the back, wanting to apply pressure quickly.\"\n\nThe striker, Santiago Gimenez, he came also for not that much money (\u20ac6m) and he has proved, especially in the title-winning season last year, he proved such an important player.\n\nSlot's managed to get some really good players on the cheap - and that must be music to the ears of the Liverpool owners.\n\nThere's been quite a few players in the last few years and they've developed pretty well. He also has some young talents. There is one, Quilindschy Hartman, who actually made his debut for the Dutch national team as well (recently). If he is fit, I wouldn't be surprised if he will play at the Euros. He's a bit like Trent, a local guy, a wingback kind of player.\n\nHe [Slot] definitely has an eye for young talent and also has the kind of guts to give them a chance in the team. That's something Liverpool and definitely its owners will like.\n\nHe seems to get on really well with his players. You don't really hear players being unhappy. He seems to have a very straightforward and relaxed approach.\n\nThere's a clip of of of him at a team talk away at Ajax after the game, he's he's not really too emotional but but just kind of like (how) he is.\n\nYou can see he connects with his players but he still keeps some kind of like calm kind approach.\n\nI think it's a good point - and in the end of the day you never know whether somebody will be a success or not.\n\nPersonally I think to succeed Jurgen Klopp is just very tough regardless who you are. Even Xabi Alonso, who seems to be at the moment the, the top of the top, probably would find it difficult.\n\nIn terms of comparisons with Ten Hag it's difficult to compare. But the budgets [available at Ajax vs. Feyenoord] I think the last two years Feyenoord of has spent around maybe 30 million on players where Ajax had an outlay of around 200 million and [Feyenoord] finished both seasons above Ajax.\n\nAn interesting quote is from Marco van Basten, who was talking in a Dutch TV talk show, and he said he is just sure he [Slot] can do it at Liverpool.\n\nHe said 'he can go to Bayern Munich, Liverpool, you name it, you know, and he will do well'. And he says 'players at Liverpool are even better.' So it's easier for them to kind of translate his message on the pitch.\n\nI think he can manage that, if Van Basten says that, that obviously tells you something.\n\nThat definitely tells you something [and] probably it's also a thing of you don't get the Liverpool job offered every day! So that's also a factor.\n\nI think that's a good thing about him, he's not thinking too much in in dilemmas, in, in difficulties, in obstacles.\n\nIt is obviously a massive challenge to succeed someone like Klopp but he's really positive; a really positive kind of person. He doesn't really think in obstacles, but more in kind of like chances. And it's a huge chance for him to to do well.\n\nI think that they should be definitely optimistic.\n\nI like to look at what he's done so far. Because even before Feyenoord, he was the manager of AZ Alkmaar and he was doing really well; they were actually first or second in the league when the season got suspended because of corona - and in Holland, for him, unfortunately, the season was cancelled.\n\nMaybe he could have won the league that year [2020].\n\nIf you can do it at different clubs; Liverpool fans should be really kind of, enthusiastic, because why would he not do that at Liverpool?\n\nI think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic.\n\nA massive thanks to Arthur for his insight.

Bayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso ruled himself out last month while West Ham's links to Amorim came as Liverpool's interest in him cooled.\n\npreviously reported that the Reds were prepared to make an \"out-of-the-box\" appointment ahead of Michael Edwards' reunion with Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group as CEO of football. Their detailed recruitment process has seen director of research Will Spearman heavily involved - and Slot's inclusion on the shortlist should not come as a surprise.\n\nIndeed his name figured prominently on a list prepared for by data specialists Analytics FC back in February. Their head of content Alex Stewart told Slot is a \"good stylistic fit\" and his teams play with the same aggression as Klopp's side, favouring longer passes and quick breaks.\n\nSlot's CV is impressive; he won the Dutch Cup last weekend with Feyenoord and won the Eredivisie in 2022-23. He is charismatic and adored by the club's supporters, while he was also a contender for the Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur vacancies last season, although opted against pursuing either.\n\nHis stance would likely change if Liverpool formalise their interest, with the prospect of replacing Klopp understood to appeal. Feyenoord will likely fight to keep him, though.\n\nThe Reds appear to be trying to steal a march on their rivals in what promises to be a busy managerial market in the summer.\n\nAs well as Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are trying to fill managerial vacancies, while Manchester United could join that crop of clubs if Ineos decide to dispense with Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe number of potential candidates seems to be dwindling, with Julian Nagelsmann having committed himself to Germany until 2026.\n\nDe Zerbi, who is admired by incoming Liverpool director of football Richard Hughes, also has admirers at Bayern Munich and there was an element of politicking when news of West Ham's interest in Amorim emerged earlier this week.

Unfortunately, though April has seen the Reds completely collapse.\n\nIt's been proof that Liverpool need changes around Anfield, and Arne Slot could be the man to instil new ideas.\n\nJurgen Klopp seems to have run out of ideas in his final few years at Liverpool. Last season was proof of that and the last few weeks are just a confirmation.\n\nKlopp has been brilliant for so many years, but we cannot deny Liverpool have ran out of gas towards the end of his time at the club.\n\nWhat the Reds need now is a manager with fresh ideas and a new approach. Slot needs to think a little bit differently to Klopp and come up with new ideas that do not leave the Reds open and vulnerable.\n\nThis was very much evident in the defeat to Everton. Liverpool looked completely lost on the pitch.\n\nOne of the key elements that Slot needs to change at Liverpool, which became blatantly obvious last night is the Reds' attack.\n\nSlot needs to find a way for Liverpool's attack to be more clinical in front of goal. He needs to set-up a system where Liverpool's attackers are much better at converting chances.\n\nHe also needs to instil a little bit of confidence in some of the club's attackers, who seem devoid of it at the moment.\n\nThis will be his most difficult task, but it's one that he has to get right in order to make Liverpool competitive again.\n\nAfter Everton, it's becoming obvious that Liverpool also need a major reshuffling in the playing squad again.\n\nThere are some players who are nearing the end of their shelf life at the club. Andy Robertson, for example, has looked miles off the pace, and Liverpool should definitely be searching for his future replacement.\n\nThere are others in the squad as well who Slot could think about upgrading.

After the post Jurgen Klopp era, it is looking like it will be Arne Slot who will take over as the next manager of Liverpool.\n\nIt's an interesting appointment. Slot's name has emerged out of nowhere for Liverpool. However, he has been highly regarded back in the Netherlands for quite some time as an innovator.\n\nAnd has achieved a lot of success helping Feyenoord to an unprecedented league title last season, and also taking them to the Europa Conference League final.\n\nBecause he is a relatively unknown figure, when Slot's name initially emerged as a potential candidate to succeed Jurgen Klopp, there was a lot of negative fan reaction on social media.\n\nThat's because most fans were not really aware of who he was and what he was like. Slot has always been a respected player and manager in the Netherlands.\n\nLike Klopp, he has had a pretty unordinary playing career, but he always seemed destined to be a manager. Former teammates have described how he was always questioning things even as a player - very similar to Klopp at Mainz.\n\nIn addition to that, he does play with an exciting level of intensity. Slot's team like to press high up the pitch and play similar to Klopp's gegenpress. This will ensure continuity at Liverpool, and the fans can expect exciting attacking football that they will love.\n\nThe third reason why fans will love Slot is because of his demeanour.

When responding to reporters he doesn't shy away from quips and witty remarks.\n\nIn this sense, even away from the data, Slot does feel very Klopp esque. He may not be everyone's favourite choice.

A compensation offer has been made with Slot having no release clause in his contract.\n\nThe Dutchman, who has won league and cup honours over the past two years, is keen on a Liverpool switch. Slot would look to bring some of his staff with him to Anfield and an announcement could be made before the weekend, reports the Daily Mail.\n\nThe Feyenoord boss' playing style is seen as a major draw for the Reds hierarchy, who see similarities between his philosophy and the one employed by Klopp across his nine years at the club. That is likely to aid the transition period with the club aiming to continue with the success they've become accustomed to.\n\nSlot was on the radars of Tottenham and Chelsea when they eyed new managers recently, but he opted to remain in Rotterdam. His Feyenoord side have been impressive once again this term, but look set to miss out on the Eredivisie title to rivals PSV.\n\nLiverpool will enter a new era next term but Klopp will not enjoy the dream swan song as the Premier League title now looks to be beyond them. Several weeks ago the German had hopes of leaving as a quadruple winner, having already claimed the Carabao Cup.\n\nSince then though they've been dumped out of the FA Cup and the Europa League whilst their league hopes were dealt a major blow by a defeat at Everton. The Toffees landed the Merseyside derby bragging rights as they secured a memorable win at Goodison Park.\n\nJurgen Klopp was undone in his final Merseyside derby\n\nThe relegation strugglers scored a goal in either half to leave Liverpool in second - three points behind Arsenal and a point ahead of Manchester City, but having played two more games. Klopp apologised to the fans after his final derby failed to go his way.\n\nHe said: \"I really feel for the people. I am really sorry for that. People told me so often what a great record we have in the derby. We never lost here before and it feels really different. I really apologise for that. It was unnecessary but it happened. I have no good thoughts at all. Very disappointed and frustrated. It was not good enough.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

He's on the front foot, aggressive, attacking, but he also looks at himself as a well drilled coach that wants to defend and keep clean sheets,' Spearing told Stadium Astro.\n\n'He's a manager that would maybe suit the Liverpool style, on the front foot, wanting to score goals, wanting to play attractive football, has a certain way of playing the game, but also wants to be a real nut to crack as well.\n\n'He wants to keep clean sheets, he wants to win things, he's had a very successful season with Feyenoord.\n\n'Whoever comes in to follow Jurgen Klopp is going to have a difficult role, but whoever comes in has to go and take the role on, do it his way and hopefully there are successful times ahead for the club.'\n\nSpearing feels it is important that Liverpool are able to keep hold of their 'key players' as they enter a period of transition in the post-Klopp era.\n\n'I think it's a good sign that Liverpool have reappointed Michael Edwards and obviously Richard Hughes as the sporting director,' he added.\n\n'They're two big appointments and you can see that the club want to sort out the backroom before they go and come forward.\n\n'Liverpool have known about Jurgen's decision for such a long time and I don't think they will be looking now to find a manager. I think things will have been done weeks and months ago. It's a long process.\n\n'They knew Jurgen was on his way and when Jurgen leaves it will be an incredible loss but, for the future of the club, there are going to be big decisions on players.\n\n'Is the manager going to come in and is he going to be happy with the dressing room? Players talk about it, \"Should we have him? Should we have him?\", but Arne Slot is a proven manager.\n\n'He's shown that he can handle a big club, Feyenoord is a big club in Holland, and fingers crossed whoever comes in can keep key players because Liverpool don't want to be in that transition mode where we start losing key players as well as Jurgen Klopp.'\n\nAsked whether he has a preference for the manager position, Spearing replied: 'Do you know what? For me, those big decisions aren't my decision.\n\n'I'm with the U21s, working with the young lads, and obviously my decisions are mainly ran by the academy director Alex Inglethorpe, but whoever comes in, it will be an absolute privilege to work under.\n\n'It's been an incredible 18 months to two years for me to work under Jurgen Klopp and Pepijn Lijnders.

Liverpool opened negotiations with the Dutch club on Wednesday as they ramp up their efforts to appoint a successor.\n\nWesterveld, who won the treble with the Reds in 2001, was team-mates with Slot at Sparta Rotterdam. The pair made 21 appearances alongside each other during the 2007/08 season, while they remain close friends and regularly golf together to this day.\n\nREAD MORE: Jurgen Klopp will hate Liverpool outcome but he's failed to fix his biggest problem this season\n\nREAD MORE: Darwin Nunez and Virgil van Dijk fume as Liverpool supporters respond to Everton taunt\n\nThe former goalkeeper has spoken to Slot since Liverpool's interest in the Feyenoord boss went public. And while the 45-year-old gave little away regarding his future intentions, Westerveld, who always knew his compatriot would make a good manager, thinks he would be perfect for the Reds.\n\n\"When I played with Arne at Sparta, you could see that he would become a coach,\" Westerveld told The Times. \"He was a leader, a No10 midfielder and someone who would change tactics by himself.\n\n\"I spoke to him this morning and he just said it is not a secret that Liverpool wants him but that he could not say anything. I hope it will happen.\n\n\"The job he has done at Feyenoord makes him the perfect fit for Liverpool... When he signed for Feyenoord they sold the best player, Steven Berghuis, to Ajax and they didn't have lots of money to spend.\n\n\"Everyone said it would be difficult, but Arne said: \"No, no, I will make this happen.\" A year later he became the champion of Holland with this team and that is why I think there are similarities with Liverpool.\n\n\"Liverpool have a lot of potential in the squad, and we don't have the money that Manchester City have to spend, so I think he will get all the potential out of the players.\n\n\"He plays in the same style as Jurgen Klopp: sexy football, forward pressing and the percentage of ball recoveries in the opposition half is the highest in Holland. When he loses the ball, he wants the ball back in three seconds.\n\n\"His personality is perfect for Liverpool. He is a good fit because he is not only the manager of a team, he can manage a club and the fans.\n\n\"He is an intelligent guy, he is a good analyst and when you see his press conferences, he speaks good English and is very respectful.\n\n\"You will not see Arne being like Erik ten Hag was in his recent press conference. He is a respectful guy like Pep Guardiola and he is an ambassador for the club.\n\n\"You need to be a special coach to coach a special club and I think Arne is that.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "theo_squires@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Theo Squires", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sander_Westerveld", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sander Westerveld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta_Rotterdam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sparta Rotterdam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Berghuis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Berghuis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29059075.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-50955853.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

PSV's Peter Bosz remains unlinked to the Liverpool role despite leading Eredivisie. Bosz has now spoken to the media about Slot's links to Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool are working behind the scenes to appoint a new manager at Anfield, and PSV Eindhoven coach Peter Bosz has now been asked why he's not being linked with the job, despite Feyenoord's Arne Slot being a strong contender.\n\nIt's understood that Feyenoord manager Slot is now a leading contender for the soon-to-be vacant role at Anfield, with Liverpool entering negotiations with the Dutch club. The 45-year-old has done an impressive job during his tenure, but they currently find themselves nine points behind PSV who occupy first place in the Eredivisie.\n\nPSV, managed by Bosz, look set to lift the Dutch title this season, and it might come as a surprise that the 60-year-old coach hasn't been linked with a move to Liverpool.\n\nPeter Bosz Asked About Liverpool Job He laughed off the question\n\nBosz was asked about the prospect of Liverpool appointing Slot in his press conference on Wednesday, and a journalist from ESPN questioned why he hadn't been linked with the job, despite being nine points above Feyenoord...\n\n\"It would be fantastic for Arne. Liverpool is of course a big club, if it all works out and it would, then that would be great for him. He is more than welcome.\"\n\nHe was then asked whether he expected the Merseyside club to make an approach for him considering PSV's league position this season...\n\n\"That didn't happen, did it? I'm having a great time here, so just let me sit here.\"\n\nBosz has managed some of the biggest clubs around Europe during his career, taking charge of Lyon, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund, and Ajax. He's yet to ply his trade in the Premier League, but it would be interesting to see whether he'd been on a move to England.\n\nJournalist Ben Jacobs has reported that Liverpool are stepping up their pursuit for Slot and things are now moving fast. The Reds appear set on convincing the Feyenoord boss to make the move to Anfield, but they will have to negotiate a fair price with the Dutch outfit. It's understood that it could cost around \u00a38.6m to prise Slot away from the Eredivisie side.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Peter Bosz has averaged 2.70 points per game in the Eredivisie this season with PSV Eindhoven.\n\nRelated Liverpool's First Offer for Arne Slot 'Will be Rejected' Liverpool's first offer to bring Feyenoord boss Arne Slot to the club is set to be turned down. Slot Ready to Move Family to Liverpool The Feyenoord manager is looking at houses\n\nAccording to Dutch outlet 1908, Slot is already looking at houses in the Liverpool area as he prepares to potentially sign on the dotted line at Anfield. It's understood that he's ready to move his whole family to Merseyside, with his agent Rafaela Pimenta sitting down with Liverpool chiefs to discuss contract details.\n\nThings appear to be moving quickly, and it's no surprise. Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards will want a new manager in place as soon as possible to allow them to prepare for the summer transfer window.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Transfermarkt", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bosz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Bosz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympique Lyonnais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mixcollage-24-apr-2024-02-24-pm-860.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

It isn't quite a done deal yet, but as the Reds 'move quickly' to see off interest from other clubs, Slot's appointment now feels inevitable.\n\nWith that in mind, we've already looked at three things that are certain to happen once the 45-year-old joins the Reds. As well as that trio of eventualities, we think it's possible that Slot will look to his soon-to-be former club for signings. If and when he does that, there's one name that should stand out.\n\nA new centre-back should also be on the Reds' wish-list, with Ibrahima Konate's fitness issues a continued concern.\n\nFeyenoord do actually have players who could potentially fix both of those worries. For defensive midfield, Mats Wieffer is a real prospect while centre-back David Hancko is a self-confessed Liverpool fans who's been linked with a move to Anfield.\n\nAnd while Hancko may then be the obvious go-to guy for Slot, we think there's another player the Reds could do with more.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Liverpool's poor finishing has really come back to bite them. Darwin Nunez has been hugely wasteful in front of goal while Mohamed Salah has been driving Steve Nicol crazy.\n\nWell, as it happens, Slot's Feyenoord may have a fix for that too. Mexican striker Santiago Gimenez has been brilliant ever since arriving in Rotterdam two years ago. Having hit 24 goals this season, Gimenez has bettered his tally of 23 from last season.\n\nOnly 23, the Mexico international has been attracting the interest of some of Europe's heavyweight sides. Back in October, Italian site TVPlay claimed that Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham were all trying to sign Gimenez, with Feyenoord looking for around \u00a343m to sell.\n\nThat doesn't sound like an unreasonable price to fix a big problem for Liverpool.\n\nWith a shot conversion rate of 20.2%, Gimenez hits the target more often than Nunez (10.7%) or Salah (18.3). In fact, the only Liverpool player to better the Feyenoord man's league conversion rate is Diogo Jota, who has 24.4%.

The attacking, front-foot football his Liverpool side have become famous for, of course, but also the fervent ferocity with and without the ball.\n\nAnd there is one metric, provided via The Telegraph, which has one-time Reds playmaker Murphy feeling that Arne Slot might just be the right man to continue Klopp's legacy.\n\n\"(The Liverpool bosses) get a lot right, so you have to put a lot of trust in them,\" Murphy begins, speaking to talkSPORT (24 April, 11am).\n\n\"(Slot) supposed to be quite a bubbly, funny guy. He's not a subdued-type of guy, which is more similar to Klopp than some of the other guys.\"\n\nFeyenoord, Eredivisie champions in 2023 under Slot and for only the second time in the 21st century, have made the most 'high turnovers' in Europe this season. Liverpool are in second, managing 705 compared to Feyenoord's 722.\n\n\"I have been looking at how his team plays,\" Murphy adds. \"It's front-foot stuff. Good, attacking football. He won the league within two years at Feyenoord.\n\n\"The most interesting bit was the turnovers. the highest in all seven leagues over the last season. Liverpool were second! So maybe they're looking at some similarities around energy, attacking football.\n\n\"The other thing is they've got a great stat about coming back from losing positions. I don't know if that's a good thing! But it shows resilience.\"\n\nFeyenoord, it goes without saying, come up against far weaker opposition in the Netherlands than Liverpool do in England.\n\nLike with Eredivisie players, Eredivisie managers have a rather mixed record in English football. Frank de Boer was sacked, as you'll recall, after just four goalless and winless games at Crystal Palace. Erik ten Hag's impressive first season at Manchester United, meanwhile, has given way to a dismal second.\n\nSlot, however, ticks more boxes than most.\n\nHe's a proven league winner, boasts a formidable record when turning good players into great ones, loves to develop hungry, young talent, and instills a high-pressing, high-octane style that will feel very familiar to Liverpool supporters who have spent the best part of a decade rocking out to Klopp's self-professed 'heavy-metal football'\n\nHITC, meanwhile, understands that although Slot's name has emerged relatively recently, he has been on Liverpool's radar from the very beginning of the process. Michael Edwards, their former director turned CEO of Football, is a big fan of a man who was on Tottenham, Chelsea and Leeds' radar as recently as 2023.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_owen@hitc.com", "name": "Dan Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Murphy_(footballer,_born_1977)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_de_Boer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank de Boer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2084624890-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 927, "textEnd": 935}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

With Slot already said to be looking for houses on Merseyside, his appointment now feels like a matter of time.\n\nConsequently, plenty of opinions have already been shared about the Dutchman, with Jamie Carragher one of the latest to weigh in. But as a former teammate of Slot it's Carragher's old Liverpool colleague, Sander Westerveld, who's opinion may hold more weight.\n\nWesterveld shared a dressing room with Slot for a season at Sparta Rotterdam back in 2007/08.\n\nAnd as he spoke to Sky Sports about the Feyenoord boss yesterday, it was clear that the two have remained friends ever since.\n\nBut as well as giving some insight into what Liverpool can expect from Slot himself, Westerveld also claimed that the manager's assistant - Sipke Hulshoff - could be a huge help at Liverpool.\n\n\"A big factor I think which also helps is that his first assistant is the first assistant of the national team as well under Ronald Koeman,\" said the 49-year-old.\n\n\"So, he already worked with Van Dijk and Gravenberch and Gakpo. That will help.\"\n\nObviously, with nothing official at this point, anything written about Slot and Liverpool is still just speculation.\n\nHowever, it has already been reported that the former AZ Alkmaar manager will indeed be bringing Hulshoff with him to Merseyside.\n\nAs Westerveld mentions, this could be a real help to Slot. The 49-year-old has already worked with three Liverpool players for over a year.\n\nIt's no small matter that one of those just so happens to be the club captain, too. Although there are some question marks over Van Dijk's post-Klopp future, the expectation will be that he's at Liverpool next season.\n\nHis staff being familiar with such an influential player - as well as two more he can build the team around - will no doubt be useful to Slot.

Xabi Alonso first emerged as the favourite to fill the prospective manager vacancy at Anfield before committing his future to Bayer Leverkusen, forcing the Reds to expand their hunt for a head coach.\n\nThe likes of Ruben Amorim and Roberto De Zerbi have been mooted as potential candidates to take the reins at Liverpool, but a new frontrunner has emerged - none other than Arne Slot. According to The Athletic, the Reds have made the Dutchman their preferred choice to succeed Klopp.\n\nThe report states that Liverpool have already opened talks with Feyenoord. The Athletic add that Slot is 'enthusiastic about a potential move' and there are still other targets on the club's list.\n\nAfter leading the Rotterdam-based outfit to their first Eredivisie title in six years last season, the 45-year-old was heavily linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur before opting to sign a three-year contract extension at De Kuip. So, the Lilywhites appointed Ange Postecoglou instead.\n\nSpeaking to the official club website, Slot explained why he snubbed Spurs. He said: \"I'm not done here yet. We have had a wonderful season with Feyenoord, with the championship as a wonderful reward for all the hard work that has been put in, but I really want to continue building.\n\n\"After the summer, an adventure awaits in the Champions League and there is a national title to defend.

They defeated NEC Nijmegen in the KNVB Cup final at the weekend, with club's general and technical director commenting on the former Spurs target's future.\n\nSpeaking to ESPN, as quoted by Dutch publication Voetball International, Dennis te Kloese said: \"I think it is logical that he is in such a good position. It is very special how he has manifested himself in recent years and has really given Feyenoord a face.\n\n\"We responded by extending his contract.

He won the Eredivisie title last season - only Feyenoord's second title since the turn of the century - and the KNVB Cup on Sunday.\n\nBut what is Slot's style of play? What are his similarities to Klopp? Is he a Liverpool-style coach and does he have the man-management skills to take over at English football's biggest club?\n\nWell, European football expert Kevin Hatchard was on hand to answer all those questions and how Slot is a manager who likes 'aggression without the ball', as he told talkSPORT (23/04/24 at 6:40 pm).\n\nThat is right down Klopp's street. Added to that, he prefers two formations - a typical Dutch style 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1.\n\n\"I think it's an interesting one,\" said Hatchard. \"I think this was always going to be a forensic process, a data-driven process if you look at the people involved. Obviously, there was interest in Xabi Alonso but he has distanced himself from that and Liverpool have had to look elsewhere.\n\n\"If you look at Arne Slot and what he has done at Feyenoord, and how he has done it. It's very much aggression without the ball. Trying to win the ball high up the pitch. He does like to play attacking football. He can play 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1. He has had success, won the Eredivisie title last season, won the Dutch Cup this time around and has had some good runs in Europe.\n\n\"There are concerns, as there would be over any coach, because if it was Ruben Amorim and he came in from Portugal, then you would say 'can he make that leap from the Primeira Liga?' It's the same with Arne Slot, it doesn't necessarily translate into surefire success in the Premier League. But it doesn't say it couldn't be. Speaks good English. Good communicator.

Teun Koopmeiners could join former boss Slot at Liverpool, bringing a winning mentality and goal-scoring abilities from midfield. Koopmeiners' familiarity with Slot's system could aid Liverpool's transition post-Klopp.\n\nArne Slot has become the latest name to be linked with Liverpool in their hunt for a new manager having achieved vast success at Feyenoord since taking over in 2021 - and should the Dutchman make the plunge to join the Reds, he could bring former midfield star Teun Koopmeiners with him to Merseyside.\n\nJurgen Klopp's message that he would be departing the club in the summer came as a huge shock to many in footballing circles, and it left many wondering who club executives would bring in to replace the German after a nine-year spell that has produced eight trophies and many memorable moments.\n\nXabi Alonso was first targeted but he opted to stay at Bayer Leverkusen. Ruben Amorim was next in line, but after unsuccessful talks with the Reds and West Ham United, the Portuguese boss seems set to continue at Sporting Lisbon. Slot has emerged as the third-favourite, and his strong track record elsewhere makes him an attractive option - and should he make the move, he could bring Koopmeiners with him.\n\nLiverpool: Transfer and Manager Search Latest The Reds still have yet to decide on a new boss despite plenty of options\n\nLiverpool have been touted to make a move for the Dutch boss and having only lost 23 of his 146 matches in charge of Feyenoord, Slot has bred a winning mentality which could be ideal for Liverpool to hit the ground running under his supervision, and thus continue to compete for titles.\n\nShould he move, there is already a Dutch contingency at the club in Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo; but that could be added to with the signing of Koopmeiners, who has been linked with a move to Anfield.\n\nSlot would surely get the best out of his former midfielder. According to Bence Bocsak on X (formerly known as Twitter), Koopmeiners played 58 times under Slot's supervision, though he scored a staggering 21 goals and registered seven assists in his time at AZ - though he was swiftly moved on to join the current Europa League semi-finalists...\n\nOne player who absolutely thrived under Arne Slot and who has been linked with #LFC is Teun Koopmeiners. - 58 games - 21 goals - 7 assists He played in a double pivot as one of the CDMs in Slot's 4-2-3-1 formation at AZ Alkmaar. He was also Slot's captain. Could be one to watch.\n\nScoring almost one goal every two games from a double-pivot position in midfield is almost unheard of, let alone in the top-flight of a strong footballing formation, but sweet strikes are what Koopmeiners specialises in and his addition at Anfield could be well received if both him and Slot make the switch.\n\nHaving also featured as captain under the current Feyenoord gaffer in his time in Alkmaar, Koopmeiners knows Slot's system inside out and that could be a huge help in the transition of a new boss, with Jurgen Klopp's rock-and-roll style perhaps needing a few months to differentiate from after nine years at the helm. It's understood that a fee of around \u00a343m should be enough to secure the signature of Koopmeiners.\n\nArne Slot's Managerial Career Slot has emerged as a late runner but talks have been 'positive'\n\nThe 45-year-old coach spent a lengthy career playing in the Eredivisie for a number of clubs, though it has been management where he has made his name. Becoming manager of AZ Alkmaar back in July 2019, he led the club to.a joint-first finish in the Dutch top-flight by the time Covid-19 came around, and whilst they weren't awarded the title, it was clear to see that Slot's managerial talents were set to blossom.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Koopmeiners has 21 Netherlands caps at the age of 26.\n\nSacked for agreeing a deal with fellow Netherlands outfit Feyenoord, this move has seen Slot's career take off and hit unexpected heights. 94 wins in just 146 games in all competitions has seen the Rotterdam outfit crowned as Eredivisie winners, alongside winning this season's KNVB Cup and finishing as Europa Conference League runners-up in his first campaign at the club; which has brought interest from all across Europe.\n\nRelated Arne Slot Ready to Move Family to Liverpool Liverpool are looking to appoint a new manager to replace Jurgen Klopp in the near future, and Arne Slot has emerged as a candidate.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

To go from the imperious Klopp to who-he? Slot - I mean WTF Liverpool, seriously.\n\nThe world needs to know - who is this guy? He got second in the Eredivisie? Yippe ka yay! Even ten Hag won the damn thing, and we sure do not want Ten Hag anywhere near Anfield Road except for 7-0 pastings.\n\nAs a club with the best support, we Liverpool fans are never rewarded. We're always a player or two short during the best of times, we missed being League champions by a point or lose Champions League finals due to a meme keeper.\n\nAnd now, those times are gone as well.\n\nSlot will take us from 3rd to 10th. He's the Dutch Brendan Rodgers. He will spend 5 years 'rebuilding', fill our squad with mid-table personnel and the season we make it back to Europa will be an achievement.\n\nThere's your lot, Slot.\n\nVinnie 'LFC' Pee\n\nREAD: Klopp was not Liverpool's first choice either: Mourinho, Wenger offer hope to Arne Slot\n\nSlot Ten Hag\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was published posing a counter-factual question on whether Ten Hag taking over at Liverpool this season would have been a truer test of his ability. At the time I thought it was a bit of a shame this couldn't be tested. Obviously this also piqued the interest of the Liverpool hierarchy, who have since gone (I assume purely based on my email) after a promising, bald, Dutch manager to fill the role in the experiment.\n\nIt'll also put to the test another theory: every odd numbered high profile bald appointment is a success - Pep (1st) Great; Ten Hag (2nd) terrible; Slot (3rd) soon to be Great.\n\nDan\n\nREAD: Where does Arne Slot rank in top 10 bald football managers in the world today?\n\nMaybe give them some time?\n\nLee is frustrated that \"we\" went from Xabi Alonso as the anointed one to Ruben Amorim to now Arne Slot, and I can understand that he would like some clarity on who Liverpool's manager is going to be next season. Everyone would.\n\nThing is, we don't know that Liverpool have spoken to any of these managers. The search for a new manager is being carried out by someone with a track record of a) surprising people.with transfers (remember Fabinho just turning up?) and b) with the best will in the world, lying through his teeth to the media about what he's doing.\n\nWe should probably take it easy and see who the new manager is, or, and I imagine this is a controversial point, maybe give him or her a few games, before we jump to any conclusions about how Liverpool are doomed to failure.\n\nDara O'Reilly, London\n\nWhat is a succession plan anyway?\n\nI don't really get Steven Chicken's article about succession planning for Klopp. The Man City style model (if that's really what they are doing) isn't available to them, so, I'm not really sure of what Liverpool could do differently.\n\nThe truth is we have absolutely no idea what's going on behind the scenes. But I would be pretty confident that they been keeping tabs on managers all around Europe who they feel would be a good fit to succeed Klopp. On that list was probably Alonso, Slot, Amorim and many others. But that's all they really can do. Remember, Klopp had a contract until 2026. Maybe Alonso was the number 1 choice, but what should they have done?\n\n\"Hi Mr Alonso, we're just wondering if you'd like to be available to be Liverpool manager in 2026. Or maybe before then if our manager leaves early. Is that ok? Please?\"\n\nTo my eye, what they are doing is quite sensible. It's April. It's not like we're in August, scrabbling around before the start of the season. They are going through an extensive process of looking through their options and seeing who would be a good fit. Presumably they've spoken to Amorim and if reports are true, they were not convinced. Arne Slot is now the favourite so maybe they've had a conversation and like what they hear.\n\nBut from Steve's article it seems he thinks they should have had these conversations and made the appointment before Klopp resigned, which I don't really get.\n\nMike, LFC, Dubai\n\nNobody turned up, did they?\n\nIn today's mailbox, Lee talks about Liverpool and the manager carousel stating Arnie Slot has \"one title win in a season where the competition didn't turn up\".\n\nYou might want to reflect on Liverpool's only title win in 34 years, Lee, which also happened to be in the same year that the rest of the world was preoccupied with a little pandemic that was going on.\n\nColin\n\nHere we go again for Arsenal...\n\nDeja vu does not cover what I am feeling right now...\n\nThe worst part, I am seeing double...\n\nI am currently seeing two teams, pushing, chasing till the end of the season. Winning regularly, with some shaky performances but having hope that City will drop points. If history repeats itself, which it has several times in the last few years, West Ham will be 2-0 up by half time on the final day, only to succumb 3-2 to a 40 Yard strike from Nathan Ak\u00e9, followed by a Bernardo/Haaland Blitz in 2 minutes, to win City the league by 2 points.\n\nNik (watch Liverpool drop points tonight to make me look a fool), Paris\n\nOdegaard is no Bergkamp\n\nI love Odegaard as much as the next man but he's no Dennis Bergkamp.\n\nDennis Bergkamp would have been burned as a witch in medieval times.\n\nLet's not forget that goal against Newcastle where he said he chose the quickest route to the ball.\n\nLast night was the sweetest victory in decades for the Arsenal, however.\n\nWhile there was a point to our reliance on youngsters during our barren years in that it paid for our stadium and we're reaping the rewards today, I've no idea why Chelsea thought, 'yeah, let's do what Arsenal did'.\n\nArsenal fans may be insufferable right now but a lot of it is just giving it back to Chelsea after the Abramovich years.\n\nIt's enjoyable but I'm not partaking in it as I remember where we were 10 years ago.\n\nGraham Simons, Gooner, Norf London\n\nArsenal going up in the world\n\nWe may not win it but we're now looking pretty sweet. Therefore, are we now a more attractive prospect for some of the higher tier players from our rivals?\n\nWhy aren't we being linked with Cole Palmer, for example? Good goal scorer, would be good competition for Saka. Likewise Garnacho. Surely he doesn't want to stay up there in that clown of a club? Similarly, Mainoo. Ok, maybe that's less likely due to his name sounding to homophonic..\n\nOur close season is going to be super intriguing. There'll be some much needed exits and I can't wait to see who comes in.\n\nFinally, why is no one taking Tuchel seriously? He should really go to Liverpool. Surely he's ideal for them?\n\nJazGooner (msg to Stewie, we may not win this season but come on, surely you can see tangible progress)\n\nErm...\n\nMy contention that Arsenal is a small-mentality club has been irrefutably disproved by Havertz scoring a couple of goals, at home, to *checks notes*....a mid-table team with their worst PL defensive record in history! I guess that must also now make Matheus Cunha of Wolves the new Thierry Henry? Because if I'm not mistaken, he scored a hat-trick, *away* at Stamford Bridge about 6-7 weeks ago!\n\nI can't recall the Wolves fans celebrating like it's 1999 after spanking Chelsea at their own home (something Arsenal couldn't do this season eh!). Or showing off that their man is the nuts - probably because Wolves realised they were playing a shite team who have fallen apart at the seams. But interesting to see a team who spent \u00a3200m over summer celebrate their \u00a3275k a week player, showing up (but not v a Top 6-7 side naturally lol). Wolves fans might have higher standards apparently?\n\nSo yeah. I apologise for the claim Havertz is about as useful as a chocolate dildo on a hot summer's day \"against any team in the Top Seven\".\n\nNaturally, a mischievous soul would ask where these amazing Arsenal performances were against Bayern just a week ago but as we all know, the Arsenal fan arrogance isn't saved for the big boys or the big trophies - just sporadic meaningless end-of-season strolls against Wolves, Chelsea etc. I stand corrected!\n\nStewie Griffin (Fake Standards!)\n\nMaybe Graham Potter was okay after all...\n\nI deduce that it is a near impossibility that any Chelsea fan will ever believe that Graham Potter was a good manager trying to make a balsa wood & cloth kite fly in a hurricane.\n\nLast night was more evidence that Potter is a good manager and the problem was/is CFC, or Man United if he is not once bitten forever smitten about going to clubs that are messy upstairs.\n\nThere are probably numerous anecdotes or euphemisms about dating beautiful ladies with eccentricities & mental imperfections but I won't go there .\n\nSo without holding my breath for even one reasonable Chelsea fan to admit that they were wrong about Potter, I wonder whether Liverpool or West Ham fans would be happy about having him as their new coach. There is something, clearly, to be said for having some Premier League experience behind you, hence a less risky bet than fishing in the Portuguese/Dutch leagues.\n\nPerhaps he is happy to take the England job?\n\nAs far as Arsenal are concerned, the only way is up. If Pep were to retire by surprise this summer, I'd have Arteta's team favourite for next season's title (no not at City you cheeky beggars) .\n\nThe Guipuzcoan and his team must've been dead happy with that overall display, though the thought had crossed my mind that losing on penalties to Porto would've been worth it to be less exhausted versus Villa. Hey ho, difficult to admit .\n\nManager Merry-go round it is.\n\nPeter (never liked Arsenal but'd be really pleased if they pipped City this season) Andalucia\n\nCold Palmer?\n\nNothing personal, but I do hope that Cole Palmer's cold sticks around until Sunday or so.\n\nGary AVFC, Oxford", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [],

Key players like Alisson, Virgil van Dijk, and Mohamed Salah could be key players under Slot's leadership at Liverpool next season. The Dutchman could also bring a couple of his players, both former and current, with him, such as Teun Koopmeiners. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe pursuit for Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool successor may be nearing its end as Feyenoord's Arne Slot is reportedly set to talk to the Reds about the upcoming managerial vacancy. The Premier League side's longstanding coach will step down in the summer, bringing his time in charge to an end after nearly nine years.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his intention to leave earlier this year, Liverpool have been linked with several high-profile managers in their quest to replace the German. The likes of Xabi Alonso, Ruben Amorim and Julian Nagelsmann are just a handful of the names that have been discussed, but it now looks like Slot is the front-runner for the job.\n\nRelated The 10 Favourites to Replace Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool Boss (Ranked) Klopp's days at Anfield are coming to an end and there are a handful of interesting names linked with the job\n\nThe 45-year-old has earned a reputation as one of the most promising managers in the game during his three years with Feyenoord. With an Eredivisie title and a Europa League runners-up medal under his cap, it's been a pretty successful spell for Slot, and a move to Liverpool could be the natural next step for him. If he is to take charge at Anfield, it's safe to assume the Reds starting lineup next season will look considerably different. With the Dutchman regularly deploying a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Feyenoord, it's safe to assume he'll do something similar at Anfield. Using that formation, here's the starting XI that could line up at Liverpool next season under Slot.\n\nLiverpool's potential starting XI under Arne Slot\n\nPosition\n\nPlayer\n\nGK\n\nAlisson Becker\n\nRB\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold\n\nCB\n\nVirgil van Dijk\n\nCB\n\nIbrahima Konate\n\nLB\n\nAndy Robertson\n\nCM\n\nDominik Szoboszlai\n\nCM\n\nOrkun Kokcu\n\nAM\n\nTeun Koopmeiners\n\nRW\n\nMohamed Salah\n\nST\n\nDarwin Nunez\n\nLW\n\nLuis Diaz\n\nGoalkeeper Alisson Becker\n\nConsidering there are very few goalkeepers on the planet that are close to Alisson Becker's level, it would be very surprising if he wasn't the man in between the sticks for Liverpool next season. The Brazilian was the final piece in Klopp's jigsaw that transformed the Reds into one of the most dominant teams in England over the last few years.\n\nHe's consistently one of the club's best performers and if Slot wants to get off to a strong start at Anfield next year, he'll stand a much better chance with this man in goal.\n\nRight-back Trent Alexander-Arnold\n\nSimilarly to Alisson, Liverpool have been blessed with one of the best players in the world at right-back. Coming through the club's ranks, Trent Alexander-Arnold has not only become one of the best right-backs in Premier League history, but one of the best to ever play for Liverpool.\n\nThere have been questions raised about his defending in the past, but there's no denying how big an impact he has on the side going forward. Slot would be foolish to even think about replacing him.\n\nCentre-Back Virgil van Dijk\n\nHe might not be quite the dominant force that he was when he first joined Liverpool in 2018, but Virgil van Dijk is still one of the best centre-backs in the Premier League and his influence at the heart of the Reds' defence is unmatched. Following Jordan Henderson's departure last summer, the Dutchman has done an excellent job stepping up as the club's new captain.\n\nWith such an important figure like Klopp leaving, Liverpool will need leaders to help steady the ship and Slot would be wise to keep Van Dijk in his backline, helping guide the Reds into a new era.\n\nCentre-back Ibrahima Konate\n\nAfter an initially slow bedding in process at Anfield following his move from RB Leipzig, Ibrahima Konate has really stepped things up recently and as a result, he's earned his spot in the team's defence going forward. The partnership he's built with Van Dijk will be very important for the club next year.\n\nThe defender is still just 24 years old and with Van Dijk on the wrong side of 30, the former Southampton man will need someone with fresher legs alongside him for protection. Sure, there are options on the transfer market that Slot could turn to, but Konate has done more than enough to hold onto his spot.\n\nLeft-back Andy Robertson\n\nLike Van Dijk, Andy Robertson's best days are pretty much behind him now, but he's still a solid performer at the very top of the Premier League. Liverpool don't have anyone capable of replicating what he does on that left side of the defence, and it would be quite foolish for Slot to look elsewhere if he is to take charge of the club in the summer.\n\nThere are few players that better represent the Klopp era at Liverpool, with Robertson's determination and winning mentality making him a huge fan favourite. Replacing him risks more than just losing something at left-back.\n\nRelated Top 10 Premier League left-backs ranked We take a look at the current 10 best left-backs in the Premier League, including Ben Chilwell, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Andrew Robertson. Central Midfield Dominik Szboszlai\n\nAfter it became clear that Liverpool's midfield had grown stagnant last year, Dominik Szoboszlai was brought to Anfield, and he has done an excellent job turning things around. He has slowed down a little as the year has progressed, but there's no taking away just how well the midfielder has adapted to life in England.\n\nConsidering the money spent on Szoboszlai, how recently he joined Liverpool and how good he's been for the most part at Anfield, it would be very surprising if Slot doesn't have him in the starting lineup at the start of next season.\n\nCentral Midfield Orkun Kokcu\n\nWhile Alexis Mac Allister has had a superb start to life at Anfield, the Reds have been linked with a very exciting young midfielder in Orkun Kokcu, and he could be one of the first bits of business that Slot attends to if he does take over from Klopp. Labelled the 'next Luka Modric' by former player Mohamed Sissoko, the Benfica man could be a massive addition to the Reds' side.\n\nSigning him early on would be a statement of intent from Slot and the club and show that they aren't going to take a massive step back following the departure of their most successful manager in decades.\n\nAttacking Midfield Teun Koopmeiners\n\nAnother player that Slot could bring to Anfield is one who has just faced off against the Reds in the Europa League. Teun Koopmeiners had significant success against Liverpool as his Atalanta side eliminated them from the Europa League. He has also worked with Slot in the past, with the two spending time at AZ Alkmaar together.\n\nA reunion in England seems like a plausible suggestion and, with their successful track record already apparent, it wouldn't be too big a surprise if the attacking midfielder was among Liverpool's starting lineup next year.\n\nRight-wing Mohamed Salah\n\nRumours of his departure from Anfield have been circulating for a while now, with suggestions of a move to Saudi Arabia, but Mohamed Salah still has plenty to offer in the Premier League and has proven that this year as Liverpool engage in a fierce title challenge alongside Manchester City and Arsenal.\n\nFollowing a recent injury, his form has taken a bit of a hit, but if the Egyptian has shown anything over the last few years, it's that he's still got the ability to change a game at the drop of a hat and with Klopp leaving Liverpool this summer, Slot would be smart to rely on the team's most impressive Premier League player ever to help him settle in.\n\nRelated 6 Reasons it Could be Time for Mohamed Salah to Leave Liverpool Mohamed Salah may actually be better off departing Liverpool at the end of the 2023/24 season due to several factors. Striker Darwin Nunez\n\nWhile his finishing has been questionable at best since his move to Liverpool last year, there's no denying how important Darwin Nunez has been to the club's performances, especially this season in particular. Contributing with both goals and assists, he's had a solid year and the energy he provides to the front line has been undeniable.\n\nThere are better goalscorers out there, but Nunez's influence in Liverpool's attack stretches far beyond just scoring goals and considering he's still just 24 years old, he should only keep getting better.\n\nLeft-wing Luis Diaz\n\nLiverpool have an array of attacking talent that could play on the left-hand side, but the most likely man to be included in the starting lineup next year is Luis Diaz. The Colombian has been superb under Klopp, regardless of the issues he's dealt with away from the pitch at times.\n\nDiaz isn't even close to his prime just yet, which should be a scary thought for the rest of the Premier League. The Reds' offence is one of their strongest areas right now and Slot would be wise to keep it as is.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [],

Captain Van Dijk has already hinted he might head out of Anfield, albeit he later rowed back on the nature of his comments.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi outfits will continually be linked with Salah - who turns 32 in June - every window from now on, unless he categorically rules out a move. He has insisted that Klopp's exit will not impact his decision on his future but that does not mean he isn't eyeing a summer exit.\n\nAll three come to a crossroads this summer, or at least within the next 12 months. The options are either sign a new deal, be sold in the next two windows, or let their contracts expire thus allowing them to leave for free next year.\n\nSlot will be required to make a quick impression on all three and perhaps the shared nationality will tempt Van Dijk to stay on - unless the club decides he and Salah are past their best-before date.\n\nFFP scope\n\nKlopp and his team have been commended for bringing so much success to Liverpool while operating on a lower financial turnover compared to other top six clubs. The numbers back it up.\n\nDuring his reign, Liverpool have had the lowest net spend - \u00a3254m - with the next lowest figure among the 'big six' being Tottenham on \u00a3484m. Manchester United have a whopping net spend of \u00a3888m and Chelsea, \u00a3835m. Arsenal and Manchester City have spent nearly \u00a3700m, too.\n\nThere is a fear that the reality of FSG's tight purse strings, hidden so well by Klopp's management, will be exposed under the new manager. The scope of spending must be a question Slot asks during his interview process.\n\nBefore deciding who to keep and sell this summer - much of which will be influenced by pre-season and the club's current stance - Slot must assess Liverpool's Financial Fair Play status, which will impact his next task.\n\nFinding a finisher\n\nLiverpool have had no problem with creating chances this season, but they've had an extremely frustrating time finding the net when it's crunch time. The Reds have actually scored three or more goals on 15 occasions in the Premier League this season but only two of those have come since the start of March, a timespan of eight league matches.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Diogo Jota, Liverpool's most clinical striker, has been absent for six of those games. That may infer a simple cause-and-effect relationship but Jota's persistent injuries are a problem, meaning he alone cannot be relied upon.\n\nHe has sat out 20 fixtures this season due to setbacks and has suffered six separate injury instances during the last three campaigns, which have increased in frequency as time has gone on.\n\nDarwin Nunez is failing to find the net when Klopp needs it most while Cody Gakpo has scored just six Premier League goals in 31 outings. The type of striker that is hunted for, be that a deep-lying forward or a natural number nine, depends on what system Slot would wish to implement.\n\nBut finding a goal-grabber under a new untried manager at Anfield will be an ominous task, especially if the funds are not available. Other areas also need strengthening but the need for a striker is climbing the priority lost with each run-in match that passes.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaac_johnson@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Isaac Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29058155.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2149224414.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

In his first season at Feyenoord, he also led the Rotterdam club to the final of the inaugural Europa Conference League.\n\nSlot, who was a journeyman midfielder as a player, began his coaching career at AZ Alkmaar, first as an assistant under John van den Brom, and then head coach from 2019-20.\n\nEarlier this week, Feyenoord CEO Dennis te Kloese responded to questions over Slot's future in an interview with ESPN, saying: \"We assume that he will also be our trainer next year. We have experienced this situation before and will take good care of our own interests.\"\n\nLiverpool were linked with a move for their former player and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso earlier this year, but the Spaniard opted to commit his future to the Bundesliga champions. Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also among the names linked with the top job at Liverpool.\n\nAustria coach Ralf Rangnick on Wednesday said Bayern Munich had been in touch, with the German club in search of a successor to departing Thomas Tuchel.\n\nRangnick said he was not dealing with any potential Bayern interest at the moment, with his focus firmly on the Euro 2024 starting in Germany in June.\n\n\"There has been contact from the side of Bayern Munich and I have informed the Austrian Football Association,\" Rangnick told Austrian website 90 Minuten.\n\n\"We have a very trusting relationship. My focus is on the Austrian national team. We are focusing completely on the European championships. I feel very well here. At the moment there is no reason to intensively deal with this,\" he said.\n\nTuchel, who had taken over Bayern just over a year ago, is leaving a year earlier than his contract after a disappointing domestic campaign that also saw them eliminated in the German Cup by third-tier Saarbruecken.\n\nThe 65-year-old Rangnick, who has coached Manchester United and RB Leipzig among others, said he would only deal with Bayern if and when the club made him an offer.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Klopp's players cut dejected figures at full-time, with the German manager seemingly conceding the title race in a press conference after the match.\n\nWhile Arsenal sit three points clear of the Reds at the top of the table, Man City have a game in hand and can leapfrog Liverpool to go within one point off Arsenal with a win against Brighton on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, speculation is mounting that Feyenoord boss Arne Slot has emerged as the leading candidate to take over from outgoing manager Klopp this summer and could be set to inherit a squad that is laden with exceptional talents and a crop of emerging young stars.\n\nBut, on Thursday's episode of 'It's All Kicking Off!', Ian Ladyman posed the question of whether Klopp's squad are capable of winning the Premier League next season, with Sutton giving his verdict on Liverpool's squad.\n\nChris Sutton Believes that Mohamed Salah's time at Liverpool is 'naturally coming to an end'\n\nJurgen Klopp's side dropped points in the title race after they were beaten by Everton 2-0\n\nMeanwhile, Arne Slot has emerged as the next favourite to succeed the German at Anfield\n\nPodcast All episodes EPISODE 81: It's All Kicking Off! - 'He's reaching De Bruyne levels' PODCAST: Listen to our EXCLUSIVE interview with Phil Foden IAKO! - Nottingham Forest are making fools of themselves!

Talks ongoing today,' Ladyman said to Sutton.\n\n'It's moving some way down the line. He is now the clear favourite. Presumably, it is him or whoever it is, does the new Liverpool manager have a squad as it stands to win the Premier League next year?'\n\n'I think, this is only my opinion. I don't know your opinion. I think, it feels like a natural end for Mo Salah,' Sutton replied.\n\nREAD MORE: The next king of the Kop! Arne Slot is a Guardiola disciple who gets under Mourinho's skin and his team's attack relentlessly like Klopp. He ticks EVERY box for Liverpool Advertisement\n\nIt comes after the Reds have struggled to find the back of the net in recent weeks, amid a string of tough results. Salah, whose contract is set to expire in 2025, has scored twice in his last seven Premier League appearances for the club, and looked frustrated after the match.\n\nThe Egyptian has joined the club from Roma in 2017 and has gone on to score an impressive 210 goals in 345 appearances across all competitions. But in the past year, plenty of speculation has revolved around the 31-year-old's future, with several Saudi Arabian sides having tabled eye-watering offers of over \u00a3200million for the forward last summer.\n\n'I think if you look at the squad, yes, it does,' Sutton continued, appearing to believe that Liverpool can win the league next season with their current squad.\n\n'I think you look at the midfield, an area, well, Dominic Szoboszlai, Alexis MacAllister, you know, have improved this season. I think they're only going to get better. I don't know the situation with Trent [Alexander-Arnold] on his contract running out.'\n\nLadyman added: 'Yeah, just to interrupt, so Salah, Virgil Van Dijk, Trent, Alexander-Arnold are all coming into the last year of their contracts from this summer onwards.'\n\n'I think they've got a pretty decent core,' Sutton continued. 'I'm a big fan of [Luis] Diaz as well. [Diogo] Jota has had injuries. Can Darwin improve his finishing?\n\nIan Ladyman and Chris Sutton both believed Liverpool's next manager would have an easier transition if Klopp does not win the Premier League this season\n\nSalah, meanwhile, struggled to find the back of the net for the Reds against Everton\n\nIt compounded their recent scoring woes, with Darwin Nunez (right) also struggling for goals\n\nBut Sutton lauded the abilities of midfield duo Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai\n\n'But I think they've got a squad which should be up there. And of course, recruitment is always a big deal. And Arne Slot will want to come in and make his mark with regards to that\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk tells 'unacceptable' team-mates 'don't even think about the title' and to 'look in the mirror' because they have no fight in a remarkable blast at Jurgen Klopp's flops Advertisement\n\n'He'll have his ideas, certain ideas on players. I think the most important thing from his perspective is that he comes in and doesn't try and copy Klopp and his style of management.'\n\nMail Sport understands that Liverpool will be forced to pay a fee of around \u00a38.59m to release Slot from his current deal at Feyenoord.\n\nThe Dutch manager, 45, is highly revered around the world of football, with Slot guiding Feyenoord this weekend to victory in the Dutch Cup.\n\n'He's his own person, but from what I've read and what I've seen, he's achieved pretty decent things at Feyenoord winning the Eredivisie last season,' Sutton continued.\n\n'They're behind this season to a good PSV team, but he seems to have really improved them. And whoever was going to take over from Jurgen Klopp, in many respects, it's an impossible job.\n\n'Slot was heavily linked with Tottenham, wasn't he, last season? I think he turned them down in the end. So clearly he's a manager who is well respected.\n\nSutton said he was a 'big fan of Luis Diaz' (right) who has scored eight league goals this season\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold (left) and Virgil van Dijk's (right) contracts will both expire in 2025\n\nLadyman and Sutton believed that Slot will need to establish his own style on Liverpool\n\n'But it is a pretty impossible job. In many ways, the job will be easier. If it looks that way, Liverpool will just finish the season with the Carabao Cup. So that'll make the job easier. If they win the Premier League, then I mean that would be a nightmare job, wouldn't it?'\n\nDespite concerns being raised over how Klopp's successor can fill the German manager's large shoes, Liverpool fans have been reacting to a video of a team-talk delivered by Arne Slot online, showing the Dutchman giving a hair-raising speech to his players. Reds supporters are reportedly 'all in' for Slot to take over from Klopp.\n\nBut Ladyman echoed Sutton's sentiment, stating that Slot might find it easier to settle in if Klopp doesn't win the title this season.\n\n'Yeah, no, that's a really good point,' Ladyman added. 'As was something you just mentioned briefly 30 seconds ago, which is that he'll have to come in and impose a different style of football on that squad. Because I've said before, the way that Klopp has played, I firmly believe [is a style] that you can't mimic and there's no point trying.\n\n'I actually think that is genuinely unique, what the way that Klopp plays in European football. So, Slot will have to come in, if it hits him, and do it his own way. That would be a huge challenge.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

It was only a matter of time before another big English club would come knocking on the door. He's not only been a successful manager, he's also been hugely impressive with his playing style of very attack-minded, Pep Guardiola-style football.\n\n\"I don't expect Feyenoord to stand in the way. They know he's a manager in demand but they will demand a big compensation fee. He has two years left on his contract that was a record deal.\n\n\"Never before in Dutch football has a team paid a manager such huge wages. The players like him, the fans love him, the club love him - they won't want him to go. Feyenoord have every right to demand a big fee as there is no clause in his contract which he renewed last year.\n\n\"He's been a successful coach and made Feyenoord champions playing crazy, sexy football. It is sexy what this man brings on a football pitch. There's nothing more to win for him here. The next step for him is to enter a club in a big league and no league is bigger for the Dutch than the Premier League.

But he sees a potential upside in appointing the 40-year-old as he previously worked for the Reds. O'Neil began his coaching career on Merseyside in 2020.\n\nLiverpool gifted O'Neil his first taste of life in a dugout with their Under-23s a year after the former Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and West Ham United star retired from playing. The ex-midfielder also stayed until AFC Bournemouth hired O'Neil as an assistant in February 2021.\n\nHis time on the south coast ultimately paved the way for O'Neil to become a first-team head coach, as well. He replaced Scott Parker in charge at Dean Court on an initial interim basis in August 2022. O'Neil also took over full-time in November 2022 yet was fired in June 2023.\n\nWolves have since relished Bournemouth's decision after hiring O'Neil last August. Now, the Englishman has been touted as a possible replacement for Klopp at Liverpool. But Bent does not feel the Old Gold gaffer now returning to Merseyside next season would be an easy task.\n\n\"He was there, part of the academy staff, wasn't he? So, he knows the club well,\" Bent said on talkSPORT. \"I do think that's a big jump. He hasn't been in management that long, so he is still a novice. Going to one of the biggest clubs in the world? Ooof.\"\n\nRead more about what Bent has had to say about O'Neil potentially replacing Klopp, here.\n\nLiverpool have now identified Feyenoord manager Arne Slot as their preferred candidate to succeed Jurgen Klopp. That is according to Dominic King of the Daily Mail, who reports that Slot is even already eying a place in the Liverpool coaching staff for his No2, Sipke Hulshoff.\n\nSlot is prepared to bring Hulshoff to Anfield if Liverpool find an agreement for his move with Feyenoord. Talks are ongoing between the clubs as Klopp will leave Anfield this summer. Slot has been in charge at De Kuip since July 2021, and they have even just won the KNVB Beker.\n\nYet 1908.nl, which also reports Slot's intentions for Hulshoff, notes Feyenoord have rejected Liverpool's opening offer. The Reds put a deal on the table on Wednesday morning to make him Klopp's replacement. But De Kuip chiefs are keen to get \u20ac15m (\u00a313m) in compensation.\n\nHulshoff has been beside Slot in the Feyenoord dugout since July 2022, as well. Slot moved the 49-year-old Dutchman into his backroom staff having been the manager of Feyenoord's Under-21s since July 2021. Hulshoff has even been coaching in some capacity since 1999.\n\nRonald Koeman also named Hulshoff as his assistant coach for the Netherlands' senior side in January 2023. Hulshoff works with Koeman during the international breaks and with Slot during the domestic campaign. Both roles are Hulshoff's most high-profile positions to date.\n\nRead more about Slot's plans for Hulshoff in his potential coaching staff at Liverpool, here.\n\nLiverpool 'fear' Bayern Munich and FC Barcelona may fight them over appointing Feyenoord manager Arne Slot. That is according to Mark Ogden, who has told BBC Radio 5 Live that the Reds have made Slot a 'serious' target but dread Der FCB and the Blaugrana forging a battle.\n\nBayern Munich and Barcelona are also in the market for managers to replace Thomas Tuchel and Xavi Hernandez. Der FCB fired Tuchel in February but he will stay in charge for the rest of this season. Xavi will also stay until the summer after he resigned at Camp Nou in January.\n\nLiverpool are keen to appoint Slot as they admire his style of play and personality. The Reds also feel the Feyenoord boss could work within their system and not upset the apple cart if he replaces Klopp. But they do not have a deal in place to spark fears a rival may also move.",

The Reds boss, who is nearing the end of his tenure at Anfield, was candid in his remarks about Chelsea's heavy defeat in the London derby, their worst since the 1980s.\n\nKlopp, looking ahead to Wednesday's Merseyside derby, emphasised the importance of Liverpool maintaining pressure on all fronts. He said that he tuned into Chelsea's clash with Arsenal for just five minutes and that was enough.\n\n\"We have to keep being a pain for everybody,\" said Klopp. \"It is difficult to ignore the Arsenal game from last night. We were aware of it as well. I watched five minutes and thought that was enough.\n\n\"That is the situation and we have to win all of our games. The situation we are in is a good situation but it is one where it is not in our hands, but we can keep it as close to our hands as possible by winning our own football games.\"\n\nArsenal's victory not only propelled them back to the summit of the league but also bolstered their goal difference, a crucial factor as Liverpool hopes to clinch another Premier League trophy under Klopp's guidance. However, this ambition hinges on Arsenal dropping points in the remaining fixtures of the season.\n\nIf not, it will mean Klopp's final season in charge of the Reds will end with just one trophy to show for their efforts. The ex-Borussia Dortmund chief will depart following Liverpool's final game of the Premier League season, with current Feyenoord boss Arne Slot tipped to take over, reports the Express.\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea could let 11 players leave at the start of the transfer window\n\nREAD MORE: Ferdinand demands explanation after Jackson avoids red card\n\nHowever, former Liverpool defender-turn Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher believes Liverpool's pursuit of Slot highlights the lack of top-quality managers on the market. He said: \"From Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump and I think it shows at this moment that there's probably a dearth of real top managers out there, when you look at who Liverpool are going for.\n\n\"Initially it was Xabi Alonso - it's only his first full season as a manager - then there was talk of Ruben Amorim from Sporting, who's only 39.

credentials to take on the task of immediately following on from the legendary Klopp.\n\nHowever, a statistical chart from The Athletic shows that his side rank among the top 10% in Europe's seven highest-ranked leagues for a series of key metrics, including both chance creation and prevention, ball retention, defensive intensity and the successful application of a high line.\n\nDutch journalist Martijn Krabbendam has previously said that the 45-year-old's teams are 'very aggresive' and 'play with a lot of energy', much like the Reds under their current boss, while he's also cited Pep Guardiola as a major coaching influence (The Athletic).\n\nJahanbakhsh mightn't have made too much of an impression at Brighton, but he's fared considerably better under Slot's tuition at Feyenoord and particularly AZ (Transfermarkt), and that apparent ability to improve players could sit well at Liverpool, where Klopp has turned many good footballers into genuine superstars.\n\nMichael Edwards and Richard Hughes won't be swayed by external opinions, although the Iranian's testimony might strike a chord with them to some degree in the managerial selection

It's nice to be part of how things work there. It was a very beautiful experience. For me, it was nice to have been there as a starting trainer.\n\n\"The energy and positivity are very present there.

Since Slot was appointed in 2021, Feyenoord have won possession in the final third more than any team in Europe's top five leagues plus the Eredivisie 722 times. The team just behind them? Liverpool at 706. Over the same period, Feyenoord and Liverpool rank first and second for high turnovers won, and also take the top two places for pressed sequences (though Liverpool are on top in this metric).\n\nCreating from turnovers\n\nKlopp famously said that no playmaker in the world is as good as a well-executed counter-pressing situation, with Liverpool's off-the-ball work an attacking weapon as well as a defensive one. Slot's Feyenoord rank first across Europe's top five leagues plus the Eredivisie for high turnovers resulting in shots with 201. Liverpool rank fourth in this metric with 182. Feyenoord have scored the most goals from high turnovers with 29, exceeding Liverpool's 17. Both teams have scored 19 goals from direct attacks in league football since the start of the 2021-22 league season.\n\nHigh defensive live\n\nPressurising teams high up the pitch requires defenders who are comfortable squeezing in behind their midfielders and attackers, even if it comes with the risk of leaving opponents space in behind. This is something Liverpool defenders Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Virgil van Dijk excel at. One way of measuring the height or aggression of a team's defending is start distance, which measures how far upfield a team's open play sequences start in metres.\n\nAcross Europe's top five leagues plus the Eredivisie since 2021, Feyenoord and Liverpool's start distance is near-identical at 44.9 and 44.6 metres respectively. Only Manchester City have recorded a higher start distance. Liverpool have enjoyed more sequences of 10 or more passes than Slot's Feyenoord. Liverpool's passes per defensive action (see below)has been 9.7 to Feynoord's 10.4, suggesting similar levels of intensity out of possession.\n\nExpected goal over-performance\n\nSince the start of the 2021-22 season, Liverpool have scored the third most goals in Europe's top five leagues plus the Eredivisie with 244. Slot's Feyenoord are just behind them with 234. Much like Liverpool at their peak under Klopp between 2018 and 2022, Slot's team have shown signs that they can consistently score more goals than their expected goals produced suggests. This is generally viewed as a negative, with diminishing returns expected further down the line, but Liverpool use more advanced, cutting-edge tools to measure chance quality. They will hope Slot has shown a capacity to produce the hefty goalscoring haul required to challenge City.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_zeqiri@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Daniel Zeqiri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahima_Konat\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ibrahima Konat\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_6NHO8z9GJLL6.gvLSLNCw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/3714636d3f530d4ca13db3235d673732", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The German leaves the Reds after almost nine years in the summer and a new chapter will begin.\n\nFeyenoord boss Arne Slot is the frontrunner to take over at Anfield and it's understood that he would welcome the opportunity of a move to the Premier League.\n\nSlot's possible arrival will be one of a list of changes at Liverpool. After years of 'Gegenpressing' and high-tempo football under Klopp, the Dutchman's slightly different style weighs heavy on a 4-2-3-1 formation but with more reliance on the wingers to create chances.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool new manager latest as fresh Arne Slot details emerge after Feyenoord talks\n\nREAD MORE: Five reasons why Arne Slot is perfect next Liverpool manager as expert gives inside view\n\nThe overhaul of the football department at the club is also set to see a switch in the transfer strategy in the summer. Sporting director Richard Hughes, who takes up his role at the club on June 1, will work alongside Michael Edwards and the new head coach in moulding the squad for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nFortunately for Slot, the current Liverpool team is already full of talent and good enough to compete at the top. But as comes with a new man in the dug-out, fresh ideas in the transfer market are considered.\n\nWith that in mind, the ECHO has taken a look at three players Slot may look to bring with him from the Eredivisie to Anfield.\n\nSantiago Gimenez\n\nFeyenoord striker Gimenez has been a crucial part of Slot's side in recent years. In their title-winning campaign, the 23-year-old scored 28 times and he has carried his form through to this year, adding 24 with four games remaining.\n\nThe Mexico international has been linked with a move to the Premier League for some time with Tottenham reportedly eyeing him up as Harry Kane's replacement. This week, it emerged that West Ham were planning to approach Feyenoord for him with AC Milan and Arsenal keen.\n\nLiverpool's current frontline are all capable of adapting to whatever slot in the front three they are required to play in. However, at times they have lacked an out-and-out number nine and Gimenez could be the perfect candidate.\n\nFormer Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt has previously been full of praise for the striker. Speaking at the end of last season, he said: \"He's back here in the middle of the defenders and he's really fast. Watching the keeper before he shoots, the rest. In my opinion, he is currently the best striker in the Eredivisie.\"\n\nJohan Bakayoko\n\nA name that Liverpool fans may be familiar with, Johan Bakayoko was linked with a move to Anfield last summer after his breakthrough with PSV Eindhoven. The Belgian winger, 21, contributed to 15 goals last term but has already surpassed that record this season with 26 goal contributions.\n\nThe right-winger, who has been PSV's replacement to Noni Madueke after his move to Chelsea, has been key in Peter Bosz's side's impressive Eredivisie season and has been heavily tipped to move to one of Europe's top leagues.\n\nWith the future of Mohamed Salah uncertain, investing in young talent could be an avenue Liverpool go down in the summer. The wonderkid is already a member of the Belgium national team and is due to play a part in the European Championships in Germany.\n\nPSV sporting director, Ernie Stewart, has already declared that he expects the tricky winger to leave in the summer. \"I don't think Bakayoko will still play at PSV next season,\" he told Voetbalkrant.\n\nLutsharel Geertruida\n\nAlongside Gimenez in this list as one of Slot's trusted individuals is defender Lutsharel Geertruida. The 23-year-old has been at the club since joining them as a teenager and has made nearly 200 appearances for them.\n\nCapable of playing at centre-back and right-back, the Netherlands international is said to be on Manchester United and Real Madrid's radar ahead of the summer. His current deal in Rotterdam runs out in 2025 meaning this summer may be Feyenoord's final chance to cash in on him.\n\nBayern Munich reportedly decided against signing the defender before signing Eric Dier in January meaning he remains available. Slot has persistently selected Geertruida and with Joel Matip set to leave at the end of his contract, he could be an ideal replacement.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_holland@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Josh Holland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Bakayoko", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johan Bakayoko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Kuyt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Kuyt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Play on Apple Spotify\n\nHowever, speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, Carragher is of the opinion that is no coincidence that Edwards has come back to the club in light of Klopp's future.\n\n'What's really interesting here is Michael Edwards, the sporting director, was there at the start with Klopp but they've obviously fallen out for whatever reason and a lot of his team have moved on,' he said.\n\n'As soon as Klopp's gone it's like the band are back together. It's obvious something has happened behind the scenes.\n\n'The owners FSG felt it was more important to get that structure back rather than who the next manager is.\n\n'There is no way Michael Edwards is coming back and not having all the power to run this club. He's not even in the same role, he's in a bigger role as they're going to try and buy other clubs.\n\n'My worry going forward is that the manager, whoever they bring in will just be a coach.'\n\nFeyenoord manager Arne Slot is the frontrunner to succeed Klopp. As detailed by Mail Sport on Wednesday, Anfield officials have contacted the Dutch champions with a first offer of compensation for the 49-year-old, who does not have a release clause in his contract.\n\nCarragher believes it is no coincidence Edwards has returned with Klopp leaving this summer\n\nEdwards has been lauded as one of the most influential figures alongside Klopp in the club's recent glory decade - playing a key role in Virgil van Dijk and Alisson's arrivals among others\n\nIt is expected a fee of more than \u00a310million will be required to land Slot, who will look to bring a number of his staff with him including assistant Sipke Hulshoff.\n\nThe situation is developing quickly and talks to bring Slot to Anfield could even be concluded before the weekend.\n\nHowever, when talking about that potential appointment Carragher raised his concerns - fearing Slot won't have the gravitas among supporters compared to other candidates such as Xabi Alonso or predecessors like Klopp, Rafa Benitez and Gerard Houllier.\n\nAsked by Roy Keane if he thinks that would be an exciting appointment, Carragher bluntly said 'no' before explaining why.\n\n'I would imagine Xabi Alonso was right at the top of the list because of what he's done at Bayer Leverkusen but also because of the connection [with fans]. That's a big thing and it's a little bit worrying for me as a Liverpool fan.\n\n'I think when Liverpool have done well in the Premier League era - Houllier had a good spell of winning trophies over two-three years, Rafa was the same and Klopp has done that - there was this real connection with the fans and then Anfield gets going and you feel like you're moving somewhere.\n\n'I think Liverpool is different to almost any club in that the manager is always the God. The manager is so important.\n\n'It feels like it [Arne] is an appointment you'd make if you were trying to get back in the top four. Liverpool are among the top five or six teams in Europe and have been for a few years.\n\n'You think of a guy, as a Liverpool supporter, standing on the sideline who can go up against Pep Guardiola. Thomas Tuchel has beaten him and got something about him.\n\n'Don't ever forget how big the connection has got to be with a Liverpool supporter and we just haven't got a coach who is a \"yes\" man behind the scenes.'\n\nLiverpool have opened negotiations with Feyenoord as they look to sign head coach Arne Slot\n\nThe 45-year-old recently won the KNVB Cup and previously won the Eredivisie in 2022-23\n\nCarragher has expressed his concerns about Slot's credentials at Anfield if he succeeds Klopp\n\nSlot, who was considered by both Tottenham and Chelsea last summer, has found immense success since joining the Dutch side in 2021 and has become one of the most progressive coaches in European football.\n\nHe recently guided his side Feyenoord to victory in the KNVB Cup; the second trophy he has won in charge of the Rotterdam giants, having made them domestic champions 12 months ago.\n\nHis accolades at the Dutch side have made him an ideal candidate to succeed Klopp at Anfield and the Reds have now stepped up their pursuit of the 45-year-old.\n\nIt should also be noted that Slot's planned press conference to preview Feyenoord's game against Go Ahead Eagles on Thursday night has been cancelled. No official reason was given.\n\nInitial reports suggested that the Reds were considering a move for Alonso, who has done such outstanding work with Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nBut Alonso wanted to stay in Germany and that led to Ruben Amorim assuming bookmakers favouritism.\n\nThe Portuguese, who has \u00a312million release clause in his contract, spoke recently about not being able to give Sporting Lisbon any guarantees on his future.\n\nLiverpool had given him firm consideration, as they have done with Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi, but they are now prepared to move in a different direction from Amorim, who is a target for West Ham United, as Mail Sport reported on Monday.\n\nJamie Carragher was speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet.", "source": {"uri":

As told on BBC 5 Live Sport, the Dutchman decided to play some serious mind games ahead of kick-off.\n\n\"He [Slot] was asked by an Italian journalist if he had been watching Jose Mourinho's teams over the last few weeks to work out which tactics to play,\" said the reporter.\n\n\"He replied, 'I haven't actually. I don't like watching Mourinho's teams. I only watch Pep Guardiola's teams because I learn something every time.\"\n\n\"That really incensed Mourinho. After the game, he had a rant at Slot in the tunnel. Mourinho was shouting, 'Go and watch Pep Guardiola. You won't win anything'.\n\n\"It was really, really embarrassing. Slot looked at him and thought, 'What a clown. I watch what I like because that will contribute to the way I want to play with my teams'.\"\n\nAs seen in the clip above, footage captured Mourinho shouting at Slot. There also appeared to be some back and forth, with some of his coaching staff also getting involved.\n\nMourinho went on to aim another dig at Slot for his lack of hair in an interview, telling Sky Sport Italia: \"No, now you know why my hair is so white! The other coach is bald, I've got white hair. It's because I've had 150-odd European matches, I've seen everything.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Then, he misinterpreted the smile I had at that moment and pushed me.\n\n\"This says a lot about him, how easily he gets irritated and frustrated.

Let us know in the comments section below.\n\nSimeone, 53, was no doubt wound up by the fact his team had just lost said friendly 2-1 thanks to a 93rd-minute decider from Naoufal Bannis. Los Rojiblancos were full of pride at the time given they'd won La Liga just a few months prior, while Slot was still in his early days as Feyenoord chief.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that Atletico appeared fired up for their fixtures against the Rotterdam outfit in this term's Champions League group stage.

It seems Arne Slot could be selected to take over from J\u00fcrgen Klopp.\n\nThe Feyenoord manager is widely considered a somewhat left-field appointment, although there has been a notable absence of really clear-cut favorites for the position since still-unbeaten Xabi Alonso announced he would be staying at Bayer Leverkusen. Following that news, Sporting boss R\u00faben Amorim was made the front-runner, but that possibility appears to have dwindled significantly.\n\nPrior to making the appointment, Liverpool got a number of other ducks lined up, with Edwards returning to the FSG fold after leaving his role as sporting director in 2022. He has since hired Richard Hughes as the incoming sporting director, with other appointments also thought to be in the works.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool team vs Everton confirmed as Mohamed Salah and Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez in and Wataru End\u014d out\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot sent Liverpool message by managerial rival Reds don't want\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports ahead of the Merseyside derby, Gary Neville says he sees Edwards' fingerprints on the potential appointment of Slot. He also put forward his own theory on the data guru's return to Liverpool.\n\n\"It'll be something that obviously has been driven by Michael Edwards and the team there in terms of sort of wanting a different type of approach,\" said Neville about the potential of Slot arriving at Anfield. \"Maybe that's why Michael Edwards left Liverpool all those years ago, because of the clash with Klopp and the personality challenge.\n\n\"Now he's got his own way and he's bringing in someone who he thinks is going to take Liverpool forward. We don't know how that's going to go: we've seen the post-Wenger career at Arsenal has been difficult, we've seen the post Sir Alex Ferguson career at Manchester United has been difficult. Klopp is massive in Liverpool so they've got to try and get that right.\"\n\nLiverpool.com says: Certainly, the challenge for Edwards is finding someone up to the task of replacing a legendary figure like Klopp. He won't necessarily have demanded a 'different' direction, but it's no secret that he will have followed the data, even to potentially surprising places.\n\nAnd perhaps Slot shouldn't really be that surprising. His credentials aren't wildly different to those of Amorim, who became the chosen candidate for many once Alonso made his decision.

I would expect to see him turn up in the Premier League at some point soon. He's out of contract at Lille at the end of the season.\"\n\nFonseca won the league title in each of his three years with Shakhtar before guiding Roma to a fifth place finish and the Europa League semi-finals. The 51-year-old was appointed Lille manager in 2022, finishing fifth in his first season, and LOSC currently occupy fourth spot in Ligue 1.\n\nMeanwhile, Amorim has been continually asked about his future as Sporting target a league and cup double. He travelled to England earlier this week to reportedly hold talks with West Ham United, though he has been viewed by bookmakers as a leading candidate for the Liverpool job\n\nSpeaking about Amorim, Brassell summarised: \"He's a terrific coach. You look at his record of success, which is outstanding, doing something similar to what Liverpool have done with Manchester City; Sporting competing with a bigger financial power in Benfica. He's flexible.

The announcements of those departures sparked a search for a manager at the trio of clubs.\n\nAt first, they all set their sights on high-calibre appointments. Xabi Alonso was heavily linked with both Liverpool and Bayern before ruling himself out of leaving Bayer Leverkusen, where he has won the Bundesliga title.\n\nThe Reds then turned their focus to Ruben Amorim, while Bayern made a push for Unai Emery. Again though, both moves failed to progress, with Liverpool now closing in on appointing Arne Slot instead.\n\nSlot has impressed at Feyenoord, where he has won the Eredivisie title and the KNVB Cup, but he still appears to be a back-up option. Likewise, Bayern have seen Emery instead sign a new contract with Aston Villa.\n\nThat has seen them turn to former Manchester United interim boss Ralf Rangnick, who has confirmed that talks are underway that would see him move to the Allianz Arena from his job with the Austrian national team.\n\nAgain, Rangnick would appear to be a back-up option and is far from the big-name boss Bayern will have wanted to appoint. Then we come to Barca, who also had Amorim in their sights, as well as Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and, remarkably, Klopp.\n\nBut with the La Liga giants hardly an attractive destination due to their financial situation, Xavi has been convinced to make a U-turn and will now stay until at least the summer of 2025. It means all three 'big clubs' who had been searching for a boss have had to go to their back-up plans.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Is Arne Slot the right appointment for Liverpool? Comment below.\n\nBayern Munich are in talks with Ralf Rangnick\n\nQuestions will now be raised that they should have waited another year before making a change, with a lack of top managers being willing to take charge this summer. Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher certainly believes choosing a back-up could create problems.\n\n\"What I would say from Feyenoord to Liverpool is a huge jump and I think it shows in this moment a lack of real top managers out there when you look at who Liverpool were going for. Now Arne Slot looks like he is the favourite,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I don't think it's like Rafa Benitez coming on or Jurgen Klopp coming in. Benitez came off the back of winning two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup and Jurgen Klopp coming after winning a couple of titles with Borussia Dortmund and getting to a Champions League final.\n\n\"Liverpool are in a different area now and fancy themselves to challenge for the Premier League next season and the Champions League, they will be expected to reach the quarter-finals at least. I think it is a huge jump.\"\n\nXabi Alonso has already confirmed his desire to stay with Bayer Leverkusen for at least one more season\n\nWith Manchester United also likely to be in the hunt in a matter of weeks, demand appears to be significantly outweighing supply. And that all appears to be playing perfectly into the hands of Real Madrid - who for once seem to be in a relatively stable position.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's future had at one point looked uncertain, but with another La Liga and Champions League double in his sights, he looks set to stay on for at least one more season. That could leave the Spanish giants, with a dressing room sure to include Kylian Mbappe along with their current crop of Galcticos, able to get a free run at their preferred target in 12 month's time.

I hope it will happen.\n\n\"The job he has done at Feyenoord makes him the perfect fit for Liverpool. He arrived there from AZ Alkmaar.

Indeed, a graph from The Athletic showed that his Feyenoord side rank in the top 4% of teams in Europe's seven biggest leagues for 'intensity', i.e. opposition touches per tackle made.\n\nThey're also in the top 2% for chance creation (i.e. non-penalty xG per 90 minutes), which attests to the 'sexy football' of which Westerveld has spoken.\n\nNo Liverpool fans expects Slot to be Klopp 2.0, certainly not straight away, but there are some encouraging portents to indicate that he could preserve many of the German's best qualities in terms of on-field performance at Liverpool.\n\nIf he can manage just that, there's every chance that he too could enjoy a glorious reign at Anfield, if indeed he's appointed as the 56-year-old'd successor.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Empire of The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_togher@empireofthekop.com", "name": "Liam Togher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sander_Westerveld", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sander Westerveld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta_Rotterdam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sparta Rotterdam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://icdn.empireofthekop.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fbl-ned-eredivisie-feyenoord-go-ahead-eagles.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

There's a way of coaching that comes back through some of the great coaches of the game. Obviously, it's a change going from the Dutch league to the English league. It's a very different approach to Jurgen Klopp, but I don't think they could ever really appoint a manager that's got the personality, character and force of Klopp.\n\n\"It's interesting. It's obviously something that's been driven by Michael Edwards, in terms of them wanting a different approach Maybe that's why Edwards left Liverpool - because he clashed with Klopp. But now he's got his own way and he's bringing in someone he thinks is going to take Liverpool forward. We don't know how that's going to go. The reality of it is that we've seen the post-Arsene Wenger era at Arsenal has been difficult. The post-Sir Alex Ferguson era at Manchester United has been difficult. Klopp is massive in Liverpool so they've got to try to get that right.\n\n\"We thought it was going to be Xabi Alonso originally and then Ruben Amorim. Now it's Arne Slot. Maybe he wasn't No 1 on the list, but the fact of the matter is that, if you can't pin down who you want, you've got to move to the next one on the list. They'll still have a good coach.\"\n\nLiverpool isn't a club that splashes crazy money like their rivals, but they have still put money in their pockets and been shrewd in the transfer market.\n\nFrom Andy Robertson to Virgil van Dijk.

While the Dutchman isn't the only name on the Reds' shortlist, the ECHO understands that he is strongly fancied by the Anfield hierarchy given he fits all of the criteria that have been set out during the process of finding Klopp's replacement.\n\nGiven that Klopp confirmed his decision to depart three months ago, the search for his successor has inevitably been a lengthy process accompanied by ever-changing speculation.\n\nUnworried by the ongoing search, Liverpool legend Didi Hamann is confident that his former club will choose the right man to replace Klopp. And while the German has no preference regarding who should succeed his compatriot, he conceded the Reds now need to make a call.\n\n\"Obviously if Ruben Amorim doesn't get the job, I'm sure they'll have somebody else (lined up),\" Hamann, courtesy of Free Bets, exclusively told the ECHO. \"There's obviously a few candidates.\n\n\"I wouldn't be too worried if Amorim doesn't come because they will have somebody lined up. I think there are a few potential candidates.\n\n\"Whether they are able to manage the club remains to be seen, you only find that out when they are there. But I wouldn't be too worried that they haven't got one for next season yet.\n\n\"There's candidates out there and don't forget Bayern Munich are also looking for a new manager. Manchester United might be too, potentially. That's three big clubs looking for managers. Personally, I wouldn't have any preference whatsoever. There are good ones out there.\n\n\"You need to see, do they speak English? How do they want to play football? Obviously it would be great to bring somebody in who gives these young players a chance that Klopp has played, mostly in the cup competitions but in the league as well.\n\n\"I think it would be a shame if somebody comes in who says, 'yeah, I'm not really one for developing players'. They have so many good youngsters there so I think that's another thing to take into account, to bring somebody in who uses these young players because Liverpool have probably got one of the best crop of young players so you've got to use them.\n\n\"And it doesn't always have to be a big name. Sometimes you just have to give somebody a chance. At the same time, at some stage you've got to make a call. At some stage, you've got to commit and say this is the man, because it probably makes it easier to attract players as well.\n\n\"At Liverpool, it remains to be seen who is going to go. Whether (Mohamed) Salah is going to go, (Virgil) Van Dijk is past 30 now so you need to bring one or two players in.\n\n\"They would like to know who the manager is going to be next season so at some stage, they have to make a decision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hamann believes his former team-mate, Alonso, has made the right decision to spurn interest from Liverpool in order to stay at Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThe pair played for the Reds together for two seasons under Rafa Benitez, memorably lifting the Champions League in 2005. And well-aware of how tough a job it could be to succeed Klopp at Anfield, Hamman is instead excited to see what Alonso can achieve in another full season at Leverkusen.\n\n\"I think 100% he made the right decision,\" he said. \"It is not an easy task to follow Klopp at Liverpool. It brings its own dangers with it and that might be another thing why one or two people, I don't want to say put off, but think what can they do.\n\n\"This guy was loved and has been very successful at the club. I don't think it is an easy thing to follow him. It's big footsteps.\n\n\"Bayern Munich, there are a lot of problems within the club at the moment too. Xabi is aware of all these things.\n\n\"He has a great team at Leverkusen and I think they're keeping pretty much the whole team together bar one or two players. They'll bring in new ones too and I think he's made the right call because if they do stay together, which I think they will, I think they can have a really good run in the Champions League next season.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hamann also dismissed the possibility of Jose Mourinho succeeding Klopp at Anfield after the former Chelsea boss was spotted at Craven Cottage for Liverpool's 3-1 win over Fulham.\n\nThe German regularly clashed with the Portuguese's first Chelsea side during his own time at Anfield. And while he believes Mourinho would be confident enough to replace Klopp, he doesn't think he would be the right fit for Liverpool.\n\n\"You've got to go in there and say, 'this is what I'm doing, this is what we do. Klopp's gone. He's been brilliant but now this is a new time, a new era',\" Hamann said. \"Mourinho would do that.\n\n\"Would he be my first choice? Probably not, because of the young players at the football club. But I think it would be very entertaining!\n\n\"I've got huge respect for him, I think he's a brilliant manager. At Liverpool, they need somebody who appreciates what he's got and understands the people. I think that has always been a big part of Mourinho's philosophy in a way.\n\n\"He has that, yes. Would he be my choice, probably not. And Liverpool is a big job!\n\n\"Don't forget the pressure because of Jurgen Klopp. Liverpool is different, it's an institution. Mourinho has worked at some of the biggest clubs, but at the same time, I would be surprised if they were interested in him.\n\n\"But we've seen a lot of things! You've seen (Thomas) Tuchel come to Bayern Munich and everyone thought this was going to be it for the next five years and they'll be successful. But they've decided to part ways at the end of the season.\n\n\"You never know if it's going to work out or not until the people are there. There's only so many managers out there.\"\n\nDidi Hamann was speaking exclusively to the Liverpool ECHO courtesy of Free Bets", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

It seems Arne Slot could be selected to take over from J\u00fcrgen Klopp.\n\nThe Feyenoord manager is widely considered a somewhat left-field appointment, although there has been a notable absence of really clear-cut favorites for the position since still-unbeaten Xabi Alonso announced he would be staying at Bayer Leverkusen. Following that news, Sporting boss R\u00faben Amorim was made the front-runner, but that possibility appears to have dwindled significantly.\n\nPrior to making the appointment, Liverpool got a number of other ducks lined up, with Edwards returning to the FSG fold after leaving his role as sporting director in 2022. He has since hired Richard Hughes as the incoming sporting director, with other appointments also thought to be in the works.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool team vs Everton confirmed as Mohamed Salah and Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez in and Wataru End\u014d out\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot sent Liverpool message by managerial rival Reds don't want\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports ahead of the Merseyside derby, Gary Neville says he sees Edwards' fingerprints on the potential appointment of Slot. He also put forward his own theory on the data guru's return to Liverpool.\n\n\"It'll be something that obviously has been driven by Michael Edwards and the team there in terms of sort of wanting a different type of approach,\" said Neville about the potential of Slot arriving at Anfield. \"Maybe that's why Michael Edwards left Liverpool all those years ago, because of the clash with Klopp and the personality challenge.\n\n\"Now he's got his own way and he's bringing in someone who he thinks is going to take Liverpool forward. We don't know how that's going to go: we've seen the post-Wenger career at Arsenal has been difficult, we've seen the post Sir Alex Ferguson career at Manchester United has been difficult. Klopp is massive in Liverpool so they've got to try and get that right.\"\n\nLiverpool.com says: Certainly, the challenge for Edwards is finding someone up to the task of replacing a legendary figure like Klopp. He won't necessarily have demanded a 'different' direction, but it's no secret that he will have followed the data, even to potentially surprising places.\n\nAnd perhaps Slot shouldn't really be that surprising. His credentials aren't wildly different to those of Amorim, who became the chosen candidate for many once Alonso made his decision. Given how the return of Edwards to the Liverpool setup (via FSG) was so heralded, it's surely worth affording him some trust in this decision.\n\nAs for the personality clash alluded to by Neville, it's only natural that Klopp grew in power as his stint at Liverpool went on, and that may have caused some robust discussions. But on the news that Edwards was returning to FSG, the manager insisted that the pair had always enjoyed an excellent working relationship, praising a smart decision by the owners.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_martin@liverpool.com", "name": "James Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Amorim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Amorim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article29055592.ece/alternates/s1200/0_slot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Some will play, some don't but we need to stay fit boys. This only a win. It's not more than a win. It's a big win but it's not more than a win.\n\n'We have a bigger goal this season and only winning for the first time in 17 years in Amsterdam. Our goal is bigger than that. So take care of your body, make sure come fit as you soon can back to the club so we can go for the last two months and make this season even more special than you already have.\n\n'We're not gonna be small. It's only a win in Amsterdam. That what we did here. I would say before but that's not completely true. So enjoy the win because it is a big win but take the obligation with you to the national team because we need you back fit. Because then we are going to make this season even more special.'\n\nJust two months after Slot's impressive speech in the changing room after beating Ajax, his Feyenoord side won the Eredivisie title.\n\nThe video of Slot's speech has resurfaced on social media, with many claiming he is the perfect man to take over from Klopp at Liverpool.\n\nOne fan wrote: 'LETS GOOO, READY TO RUN THROUGH A BRICK WALL FOR HIM NOW.' Another added: 'Genuinely tearing up watching this speech. We've bagged an elite manager'.\n\nOne football fan wrote: 'Guys I'm excited now I've come around to the idea of him as manager'. While another said: 'Not gonna lie that moved me....'.\n\nOne social media user compared his speech to that of Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta, saying: 'This is much better than anything I've seen from Pep or Arteta (because they are the only two that their fans keep posting the dressing room speeches).'\n\nWhile others were less than impressed with Slot, saying: 'Imagine him telling the Liverpool players to stay fit'. Another added: 'I love his attitude but what about his win rate'.\n\nOne fan joked: 'We need to stay fit... yeah good luck with that Arne'. While one fan wrote: 'I wouldn't listen to him let alone Salah and Van Dijk'.\n\nKlopp announced on January 26 that he would be ending his nine season stay at Anfield in May - much to the fans' dismay.\n\nIt was immediately assumed that Xabi Alonso, who has done such outstanding work with Bayer Leverkusen, would be line for an emotional return to Anfield.\n\nBut Alonso wanted to stay in Germany, leaving the door open to other potential targets - including Slot, who was considered by Spurs and Chelsea last summer.\n\nIt remains to be seen who Liverpool with choose, but Slot has certainly captured the fans' interest following his spell in Holland.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/04/23/21/83989735-0-Liverpool_fans_are_getting_excited_about_the_prospect_of_Arne_Sl-a-87_1713904377084.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-26", "textStart": 3399, "textEnd": 3409}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Slot pursuit; Reds unlikely to be deterred", "body": "Liverpool have experienced a minor setback in their pursuit of Arne Slot, although it's not one which should prove terminal to their hopes of appointing the Feyenoord manager.\n\nThe Athletic reported on Wednesday morning that the Reds have been knocked back with an opening offer of \u00a37.7m for the 45-year-old, who's believed to be enthusiastic about the possibility of taking over at Anfield.\n\nIt wasn't until recent days that news of LFC's pursuit of the Dutchman came to light, with the Merseysiders prioritising discretion and keen to show respect to the Rotterdam club in the lead-up to their victorious KNVB Cup final appearance last Sunday.\n\nLiverpool's approach is 'sure to be maintained' as they enter negotiations with Feyenoord CEO Dennis te Kloese, with Slot now the main focus of attention for Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes in the club's managerial hunt.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot's release clause just broke as Liverpool open talks with Feyenoord\n\nREAD MORE: 'Negotiating': Paul Joyce shares breaking Liverpool manager news as 'preferred choice' now clear\n\nDespite the roadblock of Feyenoord rejecting Liverpool's opening offer, Rotterdam chiefs will likely be appreciative of the Reds' willingness not to interfere in the lead-up to the cup final, which could aid negotiations in the long run.\n\nIt could also help LFC that the Dutch club have little else to play for in their final four games of the season, with a top two place (and Champions League qualification) assured and a title push highly improbable, given their nine-point deficit on PSV Eindhoven.\n\nFOLLOW Empire of the Kop on Instagram (@empireofthekop) HERE\n\nIt shouldn't take too much of a leap from the Merseysider's initial offer to sway the Eredivisie giants, who according to Paul Joyce could do business for \u00a38.6m, with the manager not having a set release clause in his contract.\n\nSlot's apparent enthusiasm to come to Liverpool could be another plus point from our perspective, with the 45-year-old unlikely to need too much convincing.\n\nThe rejection of the Reds' first offer was a slight setback, but not one which should completely derail our pursuit of the Dutchman.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Empire of The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Dutchman leading the race to replace Klopp at Liverpool - and how he might transform the Reds", "body": "Despite the short nature of his tenure as a professional manager, Arne Slot has established himself as arguably the most impressive manager outside of the top five leagues, as well as someone more than worthy of the interest he is receiving from clubs such as Liverpool.\n\nAt his first coaching job, with Dutch minnows SC Cambuur, he took the club from 14th to 3rd as well as their best ever cup finish, beating giants Ajax and Utrecht en route to a semi-final, ultimately only losing to AZ Alkmaar on penalties, quite impressive for a second-division side.\n\nThen, the former midfielder moved to AZ, where he averaged more points per game than any other coach in club history, as well as being level on points with a historically good Ajax team at the time of the 2020 season's cancellation due to Covid.\n\nHis fantastic job in Alkmaar earned him a move to perennial Dutch titans Feyenoord, where he inherited a team that had finished a meek fifth in the Eredivisie. In his three seasons at Feyenoord, they have won the Eredivisie for the first time since 2016, won the cup, and reached a European final.\n\nSlot is, tactics wise, a true student of the Dutch coaching school. His defences consist of a ball-playing goalkeeper and centre-backs, with modern wingbacks. At Feyenoord Rotterdam, the versatile right back Lutsharel Geertruida will either tuck in behind with the centre backs or join the midfield during build-up. The left sided Quilindschy Hartman plays higher up, progressing the ball through both runs and passes.\n\nHis midfield plays with a classic 6, 8, and 10. Feyenoord's current 6, the remarkably impressive Mats Wieffer, operates like a vacuum cleaner defensively and a metronome offensively. The main ball-progressing duties lie with Quinten Timber, who will often dribble through the lines to advance play, while his 10, Calvin Stengs, is a creator. Slot's strikers participate in build-up play, dropping deep to create. Overall, Feyenoord's on-the-ball play is possession based and relatively slow.\n\nOut of possession, Slot expects his players to press with a high amount of intensity. His Feyenoord teams have consistently been recognised as the fittest team in the Eredivisie, and they look to win the ball high up on the field.\n\nHowever, Slot has shown an ability to innovate and change when it suits his players or the game-situation. When in need of a goal, Slot has consistently changed his system to accommodate two strikers, and he often starts defensive midfielder Ramiz Zerrouki to create a midfield three with Wieffer and Timber in games where Feyenoord needed to control possession. Although this seems like something all managers would do, the major critique of Erik ten Hag at Ajax was his insistence on playing the same group of players, regardless of game scenario and form.\n\nThis brings us to a point of difference between Slot, ten Hag, and Peter Bosz, the two other coaches to go from the Eredivisie to major foreign clubs recently: his character. Ten Hag and Bosz have been accused of being stubborn and uncharismatic. While he is as shamelessly direct as any Dutch person worth their clogs, he feels more personable and adaptable than both ten Hag and Bosz.\n\nAs well as this, he has an ability to tap into the personality of his clubs to succeed. Rotterdam's identity is one of a working-class city, that outworks and is less pretentious than their cousins in Amsterdam. At Feyenoord, he has made true Rotterdammers like Hartman, Malacia, Geertruida, and Bijlow, as well as hard workers and mentality monsters like Wieffer, Timber, Hancko, Trauner, and Gimenez the cornerstones of his team. These are players that represent what Feyenoord stands for.\n\nLiverpool actually has a relatively similar identity to Feyenoord, both being working class, port-cities and I imagine there are a few players at Feyenoord who could interest Slot. Specifically, rock-solid Mats Wieffer, industrious Left Back Quilindschy Hartman, and the do-it-all Lutsharel Geertuida could be of interest. Slot's former midfielder at AZ Teun Koopmeiners has also been previously linked with Liverpool.\n\nI'd also imagine Slot makes signing a proper striker a priority, as he usually opts for a a classic centre forward rather than the rotating attackers Liverpool has operated with this season. Ajax phenom Brian Brobbey and all-round centre forward Joshua Zirkzee could be options, along with Sporting CP talisman Victor Gy\u00f6keres.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news",

The two centre-backs, for example, were dreadful. Next to him in the studio, Jamie Carragher tore into Ibrahima Konate in particular.\n\nBeyond that though, the nature of Liverpool's limp display also highlighted the challenge for he Reds next manager, which looks likely to be Arne Slot. And after the game, Rooney gave his prediction for what the future holds.\n\nPerhaps Liverpool fans won't put too much weight into anything Rooney thinks about the Reds. He has always been vocal in his hatred towards the club.\n\nHowever, as a man experienced in the rigours of top-level football and a currently out of work manager, his professional opinion is at least worth listening to.\n\nAnd speaking after the derby had ended, Rooney suggested that Liverpool could be in for a tough couple of years after Jurgen Klopp leaves.\n\n\"I think Jurgen Klopp is almost like a father to a lot of those players,\" explained the pundit.\n\n\"For those players now to go from Jurgen Klopp to whoever the next manager may be, it's going to be completely different. It's not going to be the same as under Jurgen Klopp, so I think players will find that difficult.\n\n\"We see it throughout football works and cycles and managers come and go. He has been there for quite a long time now, and I think some of the players will want a new challenge and I do believe Liverpool over the next two, three years will be in a transition period.\"\n\nAs Klopp prepares for his last four games as Liverpool manager, work is ongoing to sort out his replacement.\n\nOn Thursday morning, journalist Fabrizio Romano shared the latest update, with FSG negotiating a deal with Feyenoord to take Slot to Anfield.\n\nThe expectation seems to be that a deal will be agreed in the coming days. It now feels virtually certain that Slot will be the man to take the reigns from Klopp.\n\nHistory would suggest that taking over from such a successful and popular manager is something of a poisoned chalice. It'll be up to the Dutchman to prove that wrong.\n\nExpectations will certainly have to be managed amongst the fanbase, but there's no reason for Slot to feel trepidatious.

So we really can't fathom why Ten Hag is under any pressure at all at Manchester United.\n\nBut back to The Sun:\n\nWith Slot seemingly destined for Anfield, fans won't be able to help but compare his record in Holland with Ten Hag's.\n\nAnd Reds supporters won't like what they see.\n\nThey will largely be able to 'help but compare' because they are largely not idiots who realise that they would not be comparing like with like.\n\nThe Sun admit that Ten Hag had 'an arguably easier job at perennial champions Ajax' (you think?) but reel off a whole heap of statistics that will obviously hit Liverpool fans hard.\n\nThey they 'reveal' the pair's head-to-head record - available on all good football stats sites - which is annoyingly even.\n\nAnd they mate not face off again any time soon should Slot come to Anfield, with Ten Hag edging closer and closer to the sack.\n\nThey mate not indeed. And The Sun mate not ever get a sense of propriety when it comes to Liverpool.\n\nSlot > Ten Hag, innit\n\n'Robin van Persie's decision to snub Erik ten Hag for Liverpool target Arne Slot speaks volumes' is the hot take from the Mirror. Was Van Persie not aware of Slot's WORSE record? The fool.\n\nObviously the implication is that he believes that Slot is a better manager than Ten Hag...\n\nAlthough reigning champions Feyenoord aren't expected to retain the Eredivisie title this year - as they trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games to go - Slot's reputation is a distinguished one. Almost Dutch champions with AZ Alkmaar before the 2019-20 season was declared null and void, runner-up in the Conference League with Feyenoord in 2022, and finally winner of the Eredivisie last season, there's a reason why a certain Robin van Persie wanted to learn from him.\n\nHe's a good manager, alright.\n\nRewind two years ago and the now retired former Manchester United striker was being tipped for a return to Old Trafford, with the Red Devils having just appointed Erik ten Hag after his tremendous spell with Ajax. Ten Hag offered him the chance to part of his coaching staff but Van Persie made it clear that he'd prefer to stay in the Netherlands.\n\nThat's because while managing boyhood club Feyenoord's under-18 and under-19 sides, Van Persie is also involved in Slot's first-team training sessions and gets a first-hand look at a 'disciple' of Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. Van Persie shares the same principles, so opted to remain among his Rotterdam roots.\n\nLet's have a look at what Van Persie actually said at the time about that decision:\n\n\"My son and daughter are important right now. The fact that they have both found their passion is great. A hobby is nice, but you hope that they really find a passion.\n\n\"Dina succeeded in doing that with horse riding, she's totally into it, and Shaqueel has the same thing with soccer. My wife, Bouchra, is developing all her talents with our projects and that's great to see. We're enjoying ourselves together.\n\n\"In London, when I played at Arsenal, we moved five times. We also lived in Manchester and Istanbul. All in all, we were away for almost fourteen years.\n\n\"But then we thought 'what's good for the kids now?' and felt a little stability would be nice.\"\n\nSo Robin van Persie's decision to 'snub' Erik ten Hag for Liverpool target Arne Slot really did 'speak volumes'...about his love for his family and desire for stability.\n\nBald men fighting over a headline\n\nObviously, the gold is in getting the names of Ten Hag and Slot into a headline so...\n\n\"A ton of problems' - Erik ten Hag and Arne Slot truth clear as Liverpool set to follow Man United path' - Manchester Evening News.\n\nThe 'truth' that has become clear is that Ajax had \"a ton of defensive problems\" (according to Andy Brassell) while \"Feyenoord have pretty much the best defensive record in the Eredivisie and they have done over the last two seasons\".\n\nPesky fact: Ajax won the Eredivisie in 2021/22 with 19 goals conceded; Feyenoord won the Eredivisie in 2022/23 with 30 goals conceded; PSV are about to win the 2023/24 Eredivisie with a likely 18 or 19 goals conceded.\n\nSo that doesn't really feel like the 'truth'. It feels like an idea retro-fitted to Manchester United's current struggles.\n\n'Arne Slot has already made Erik ten Hag feelings clear after rivalry with Man Utd boss' - Express.\n\nYou will be shocked to learn that Slot said that Ten Hag was \"doing great\" with Manchester United when he was indeed doing great with Manchester United. So he really has made those feelings very clear indeed. More as we get it.\n\n'Liverpool dressing room has already been given telling Erik ten Hag comparison for Arne Slot' - Liverpool.com\n\nQuite why the Liverpool dressing-room would give a flying f*** how Slot compares to the Manchester United manager is unclear but what is clear is that they have been given a 'telling' comparison...by Oussama Idrissi, who started one Eredivisie game for Ajax in the season when they won the title in 2020/21.\n\nOddly, he preferred playing under the manager who gave him 17 starts in the season Feyenoord won the title.

This marks the Gunners' second win in a row since a 2-0 loss to Aston Villa that put in a huge dent in their quest for the title, and to Nigel Reo-Coker served as a statement of intent from Arsenal in the final weeks of the season.\n\nReo-Coker: \"It was men vs. boys and it was just an embarrassment. Arsenal were sensational and [Martin] Odegaard was in fine form. The passes that he was making, he really was up for it. Arsenal were doing what they have to do if they're trying to chase for a Premier League title. They have to stay perfect, simple as that.\"\n\nThere's one very big wrinkle in Arsenal's return to form, though -- Liverpool have the chance to level on points with them today with a victory, while Manchester City can overtake them once they make up their two games in hand.\n\nFirst up are Liverpool, who also are back to winning ways after a draw against Manchester United and a loss to Crystal Palace marked major setbacks in their chase for Premier League glory. Sunday's 3-1 win over Fulham offers up enough confidence before a high-stakes matchup against rivals Everton, who are in the midst of a relegation battle that might be impacted by one final points deduction. This is Liverpool's game to lose, especially since Jurgen Klopp had the chance to rest some of his top attackers over the weekend. Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez are amongst those who were on the bench against Fulham and will likely feature in a game that could be a big one for Salah's golden boot chances -- he has 17 goals, three behind joint leaders Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer. Diogo Jota, though, will miss the game after picking up an injury over the weekend.\n\nOn Thursday, it's City's turn to re-assert themselves in the title race after a break from league play to win their FA Cup semifinal on Saturday. Pep Guardiola will have to cope without Haaland, who missed the FA Cup victory over Chelsea and will not be ready in time for the trip to Brighton, though the manager insists \"it is not a big issue.\" John Stones exited Saturday's win with an injury but will be available for Brighton, while Phil Foden is also in the clear despite reportedly missing Tuesday's training.\n\nConsidering the cast of characters available for City, which includes the likes of Kevin de Bruyne and Julian Alvarez, they are expedited to pick up the win on Thursday as the title race titles in their favor. It's not just that the remaining points on the board favors them -- they have a comparatively easier schedule than Arsenal and Liverpool, and are already the oddsmakers' favorite to do so. The title race is very much in their control, especially in the midst of their 29-game unbeaten run across all competitions.\n\nSponsored by Paramount+\ud83d\udd17 Midfield Link Play\ud83d\udd34 Slot leads race to replace Klopp\n\nThe battle to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is seemingly reaching its conclusion, but perhaps not the one many were expecting. Feyenoord's Arne Slot is now the Reds' choice to be the new manager, per The Athletic, with the two clubs already engaged in negotiations around his exit. The Dutch side have reportedly already rejected Liverpool's first offer for Slot's services, which was $9.6 million.\n\nSlot impressed with Feyenoord after winning the Eredivisie last season and was in the mix for the vacancy at Tottenham Hotspur shortly afterward, which he reportedly turned down before Ange Postecoglou took the post. The Dutchman also took Feyenoord to the final of the UEFA Europa Conference League final in 2022 and won this season's KNVB Cup, offering a good match both in terms of style and accomplishments for an ambitious Liverpool side. There may be some risks translating his talents from the Netherlands to England, but Michael Lahoud argues that the easy comparison between him and Manchester United's Erik ten Hag is not apples to apples.\n\nLahoud: \"I think the big difference between [him] and Erik ten Hag -- Manchester United didn't have an identity before ten Hag got there, and ten Hag has yet to stamp his identity on this side. Counter-attack football, it's a wash. When you look at the profile of players that Liverpool have, they match what Arne Slot wants to do in terms of pressing, in terms of wingbacks getting up, in terms of midfielders. Quinten Timber Igor Paixao -- what he's gotten out of them in European football and in league football, in cup football, it really matches the profile and philosophy.\"\n\nThe choice to hire Slot comes after Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim was the longtime favorite for the role, but conversations reportedly never advanced and he has since been linked to the West Ham job. Many also had Bayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso, a former Liverpool player, in the mix but he opted to stick around in Germany for a follow-up after lifting the Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history.\n\nThe risks associated with Slot are ones that could be assigned to any one of the candidates in the running to succeed Klopp, who was essentially a one-of-a-kind choice when he had already established himself as one of the game's elite managers thanks to his spell at Borussia Dortmund and was also easily available. No such candidate exists this time around, but Liverpool's search for a new manager was also an exercise in identifying the next generation of top-tier coaches. These names could pop up again as a large batch of clubs recruits a new manager -- Bayern Munich are still on the hunt for their successor to Thomas Tuchel, while Manchester United could be on the look following an abysmal season under ten Hag.\n\nSlot might have found his seat in this round of managerial musical chairs, but the game is far from over -- and a big summer awaits.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Top Stories\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 Champions of Italy: Inter became Serie A champions on Monday with a win over AC Milan, a stunning turnaround for Simone Inzaghi who was almost fired and under pressure to deliver results this season.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Dest injury: USMNT defender Sergino Dest faces up to nine months out with a knee injury, which could leave Gregg Berhalter in a tough spot for this summer's Copa America.\n\n\u26ab\u26aa Allegri out?: Juventus could be another club looking for a new manager after a lackluster season under Massimiliano Allegri, in which their style of play reminds Nigel Reo-Coker of \"the dinosaur age.\"\n\n\u23ea NWSL rewind: Attacking prowess was very much on display over the weekend in the NWSL, with the likes of the Washington Spirit and the Orlando Pride succeeding -- while NJ/NY Gotham FC and the San Diego Wave need to go back to the drawing board.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Forest's complaint: Here's an explainer on Nottingham Forest's complaint about the officiating in their loss to Everton, which prompted an investigation from the FA following several social media posts from the club.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Concacaf Champions Cup: Here's a preview of the Columbus Crew's CCC semifinal against Monterrey, in which they have much to prove as the last remaining MLS team in the competition.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e Mbappe's future: With Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid still standing in the UEFA Champions League, here's what a final between the two could mean for the ongoing saga of Kylian Mbappe's impending departure from the French capital.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The Back Line\ud83d\udcb5 Best betsPremier League: Manchester United vs. Sheffield United, Wednesday, 3 p.m.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 THE PICK: Bruno Fernandes to score (+160) -- Despite the embarrassment of avoiding crisis in the FA Cup semifinals against Coventry City, Manchester United are the favorites to get the job done against last place Sheffield United. That does not necessarily mean Erik ten Hag's team will avoid chaos, but even on their worst days, they tend to score and with five goals in his last five games, Bruno Fernandes is perhaps the likeliest of United's squad to grab another on Wednesday.Premier League: relegation battle\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 THE PICK: Nottingham Forest to be relegated (+150) -- The odds may not be in Everton's favor in Wednesday's Merseyside derby against Liverpool, but with a fairly easy schedule compared to some of the other teams around them and the benefit of currently being above the relegation zone, their odds to go down sit at +1200. That's potentially bad news for Nottingham Forest, who are only out of the bottom three thanks to goal difference and are coming off a loss to Everton over the weekend.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa What's on CBS Sports Golazo Network\n\n\u2600\ufe0f Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Hosts Susannah Collins, Charlie Davies, Nico Cantor and Alexis Guerreros help fans get their day started on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

Arne Slot looks very likely to be Liverpool's next manager.\n\nThe Dutchman who won the Eredivisie last season has an excellent track record, and playing with a similar high intensity brand of football to Jurgen Klopp.\n\nHis affable demeanour has made him a very popular character in Dutch football, and it is an appointment that Liverpool fans should be content with.\n\nSlot ticks the data and the personality to be the right profile for Liverpool. Replacing Klopp will not be easy, but Slot's style of play will ensure continuity at the club.\n\nLiverpool will bring new players in this summer. There may not be a lot of changes in the playing squad, but it's obvious there are weaknesses in the squad that have to be addressed.\n\nOne area where Liverpool definitely need to strengthen is in the centre-back department. Joel Matip seems destined to leave upon the expiry of his contract this summer.\n\nMatip's injury will leave Liverpool with few senior options. Even with the emergence of Jarell Quansah, Liverpool will want to bring in another centre-back.\n\nThat centre-back could preferably be someone who is comfortable playing as a left-sided centre-back. For that role few fit the bill better than David Hancko.\n\nUnder Slot at Feyenoord, Hancko has established himsel\n\nf as one of the best centre-backs in the Eredivisie. He is left-footed and very comfortable playing in that left-sided centre-back role.\n\nWe also know that, as his agent confirmed, Liverpool have been tracking his progress over the last year or so.\n\nSo not only is Hancko already on Liverpool's radar, he is well known by Liverpool's new potential manager.\n\nEverything points in the direction that he could be a really smart acquisition for Liverpool, and perhaps the most obvious candidate for Slot's first transfer as the club's new manager.\n\nAt 26-years-old, Hancko is definitely ready to make the step-up to Liverpool. He is in the prime years of his career.\n\nIt also helps that he is very capable of covering at left-back as well, and has experience playing in that position.

The Brazilian has stunned Rosenior with his performances at Anfield, which have returned 10 clean sheets through his 27 appearances so far this season.\n\nAlisson has registered seven of his shut-outs during 23 Premier League games, as well. The 31-year-old was unable to take another clean sheet as Liverpool beat Rosenior's former side Fulham on Sunday, though. But the Reds still won 3-1 at Craven Cottage for three key points.\n\nIt was Liverpool's first win in the Premier League since Alisson recovered from his hamstring injury, as well. The Novo Hamburgo native's return may prove crucial for the Premier League title race, too, as Rosenior claims Alisson makes opponents waste shots with his positioning.\n\n\"He's absolutely immense,\" Rosenior said on Premier League Productions (22/04, 17:45). \"He can make a save without making a save because he gets his position absolutely right.\n\n\"You look up and think, 'I can't see any of the goal' because his position is absolutely right. It puts that anxiety and indecision in the forward and, invariably, they miss.\"\n\nRead more about what Rosenior said about Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson, here.\n\nDutch legend Marco van Basten hopes Arne Slot rejects a chance to replace Jurgen Klopp as the manager of Liverpool. The Reds have turned their attention to the Feyenoord boss while they seek a new head coach ahead of Klopp leaving Merseyside at the end of this campaign.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports, Slot is at the forefront of Liverpool's search for Klopp's replacement at Anfield. The Reds feel the 45-year-old ticks a lot of their boxes after leading Feyenoord to their first Eredivisie title in six years last term. They also like Slot's aggressive playing style.\n\nLiverpool have not settled on going all-out to name Slot as Klopp's replacement but view the coach as a strong candidate. Yet Feyenoord are also determined to retain their sought-after tactician, who Van Basten believes can 'go anywhere' but wants to stay in charge at De Kuip.\n\nVan Basten told Ziggo Sport, via quotes by FC Update: \"I hope he stays in the Netherlands for a long time because it is an enrichment for Dutch football. He can really go anywhere: Bayern Munich, Liverpool... I am really convinced of that.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I am convinced he can do it anywhere. I've spoken to him a few times and he handles the players very well. He is of course also very well-versed tactically. He can explain his ideas well, he is calm and intelligent. As far as I am concerned, he is really a top trainer.\"\n\nRead more about what Van Basten said about Slot replacing Klopp at Liverpool, here.\n\nShaun Wright-Phillips feels Mohamed Salah is a 'different player' for the worse since the 31-year-old return to Liverpool from the Africa Cup of Nations. The Egyptian has only scored six and assisted four goals in 12 appearances since helping his country reach the Round of 16.\n\nHis work has taken Salah to 24 goals and 13 assists in 39 games across all competitions so far this season. He has penned 17 of his goals and nine assists in 27 Premier League outings, as well. But Wright-Phillips feels Klopp was right to bench Salah at Fulham for a lack of form.\n\nWright-Phillips told Premier League Productions (22/04, 14:35): \"I think that's why [Klopp] changed the front line. I don't think it has anything to do with rest, personally.\n\n\"I think it's more to do with putting on chances they are creating because, to be fair, as good as Salah is, since he has come back from injury and the Africa Cup of Nations, he has been a different player altogether in front of [the] goal.\"", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"},

Postecoglou could be a good fit for Liverpool, given his success at Tottenham and Celtic in recent years. Liverpool's recent decline in form has put their title hopes in jeopardy and that looks to have ruined Jurgen Klopp's farewell tour.\n\nLiverpool's search for a new manager appears to be coming to an end in the form of Feyenoord boss Arne Slot, after Jurgen Klopp announced that he would be leaving the club after a nine-year spell at the end of the current campaign - but with the Dutchman being touted to move to Anfield, Richard Keys believes that Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou would be a perfect choice to make the move to Merseyside.\n\nPostecoglou took over at Tottenham last summer after a superb couple of years at Celtic, where he won the Scottish Premiership title in both of his seasons at the helm, alongside completing a famous treble with a League Cup final win over rivals Rangers in his final campaign. There were doubts over the Australian upon his arrival as a relative unknown in European circles, but Postecoglou has fared well in his debut season in north London, with Spurs currently sat in fifth in the table and managing their rebuild without Harry Kane relatively well.\n\nIt's looking extremely likely that Slot will take over, given that negotiations are advancing quickly and the Reds have already entered advanced talks with Feyenoord to get a move over the line. But Keys thinks that a move for Postecoglou could be done - with the beIN Sports presenter claiming that the Australian isn't on huge wages and so compensation wouldn't be much to bring him to Anfield.\n\nKeys: \"Postecoglou Would Be Terrific at Anfield\" Postecoglou has won plaudits this season after a solid campaign\n\nSpeaking on beIN Sports after Liverpool's shock 2-0 defeat to Everton in the Merseyside derby, Keys laid out his reasons as to why Postecoglou should be targeted. He said:\n\n\"I'd go for Postecoglou. The reason I say that is initially, I thought that it would take too much to get him out. Then I was told that because he wasn't first-choice, his salary isn't great and his buyout isn't very big. So that would be my preferred choice, I think he would be terrific at Anfield.\n\n\"I just didn't think it would be possible, I couldn't see [Daniel] Levy letting him go but I'm told that the figures do make sense. It was part of the conversation when I learned what I just have, I was told that clubs won't pay [release clauses] because of what happened when Andre Villas-Boas was bought out of his deal - there is no sell on.\n\n\"I repeat, Postecoglou is available and has value. I can't say any more than that.\"\n\nJurgen Klopp's Farewell Tour in Tatters Many expected the German to win multiple trophies in his final campaign\n\nKlopp's side were still in all four competitions back in mid-March, but a horrific run of form since has seen them bow out of two of their remaining three competitions. Beginning with the pulsating 4-3 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, Liverpool haven't quite recovered mentally since.\n\nHome wins over Brighton and Sheffield United in the league looked to have seen them get over their agonising loss to the Red Devils, but a draw at Old Trafford in the league shortly after sparked a poor run of form in which they have won just two of their previous six games.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Liverpool failed to win a single trophy last season - just their second trophyless campaign from five under Klopp.\n\nOne of those was the 1-0 win in Bergamo over Atalanta, though that mattered little having been beaten on aggregate following a 3-0 hammering at home by the Italian outfit; and with two league losses against Crystal Palace and Everton in the space of the last 11 days, it means that their title bid looks all but over, alongside being knocked out of Europe.\n\nKlopp's public statement in which he announced he would be leaving the club saw many back him to complete a magical 'farewell' tour by winning at least a double, having won the Carabao Cup back in February, though the only trophy they have any chance at is the Premier League - in which they will need to hope that Manchester City slip up massively with Arsenal also dropping points in two of their final four games to go above them.\n\nRelated Liverpool 'Remain in Negotiations' for Arne Slot Liverpool are pushing to appoint Feyenoord manager Arne Slot as Jurgen Klopp's replacement, and James Pearce has now provided the latest update.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

a move to the London Stadium is not expected to materialise either, but Liverpool appear to have moved on regardless.\n\nIndeed, the Reds are believed to have entered negotiations for 45-year-old Feyenoord manager Arne Slot, previously linked with Tottenham Hotspur last summer on the back of leading the Rotterdam giants to just their second Eredivisie crown of the millennium.\n\nSlot ultimately snubbed interest from the Lilywhites to sign a new three-year deal with Feyenoord, who would be due hefty compensation from Liverpool, but initial contacts are believed to have been positive.\n\nAs talks rumble on in the background, Sports Mole picks out five highly-rated Feyenoord players who could potentially follow Slot to Liverpool.\n\nSantiago Gimenez\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nA new centre-forward may be right at the bottom of Liverpool's transfer agenda, but with Darwin Nunez possessing the worst big-chance conversion rate in Europe, Cody Gakpo struggling for consistency and Diogo Jota riddled by injuries, the Reds could do worse than run the rule over Santiago Gimenez.\n\nThe 23-year-old Mexico international was a \u00a35.2m acquisition from Cruz Azul in 2022 and took little time to acclimatise to European football, setting a new record for Eredivisie goals in a calendar year with a staggering 31 in 2023.\n\nGimenez has 21 top-flight strikes to his name this year - in addition to five assists - putting him third in the Golden Boot race behind 26-goal pair Luuk de Jong and Vangelis Pavlidis, in addition to netting twice in a Champions League triumph over Lazio last year.\n\nJust shy of 6ft tall, Gimenez does not have the profile of an all-round striker who can create and link up in the same manner as Harry Kane for example, but he finds the target with 50% of his shots - according to data from FBref - and succeeds with over half of his take-on attempts.\n\nThe Mexican's standout debut season in Dutch football saw him rewarded with a new long-running contract until 2027 last year, but Feyenoord are braced for summer bids for the Argentina-born attacker, believed to be a prominent name on Arsenal's radar.\n\nHowever, a report from 90min claims that interested parties could be quoted a record-breaking Eredivisie sum to sign Gimenez this summer, surpassing the \u00a385m package that Manchester United forked out to sign Antony from Ajax; whether Slot could perform some arm-twisting to drive the price down remains to be seen.\n\nDavid Hancko\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nInstead of bolstering their already well-stocked frontline, beefing up the heart of the backline is thought to be Liverpool's top transfer goal this summer, as all of Joel Matip, Rhys Williams, Nat Phillips and Sepp van den Berg could be on the way out.\n\nThe Reds' search for a new defensive enforcer could point them in the direction of David Hancko, the 26-year-old Slovakia international who enjoyed stints with Fiorentina and Sparta Prague before arriving in the Netherlands in 2022 for a mere \u00a37.1m.\n\nAs is the case with Gimenez, Hancko's stock has risen exponentially since his capture, and having already proven himself as a major goal threat with Sparta Prague - whom he averaged almost one goal every five games for - the centre-back has enhanced that reputation in the Netherlands.\n\nFrom 89 games in a Feyenoord jersey, Hancko has come up with 10 goals and eight assists - netting four times in the current Eredivisie campaign - while he also boasts four goals and five assists in 37 matches for his country.\n\nHancko was a mainstay of the Slovakia XI during their successful qualification campaign for Euro 2024, although he largely features as a left-back for his nation, a position which he is expected to occupy at the continental gathering this summer.\n\nThe 26-year-old has earned his Eredivisie stars in the heart of defence, meanwhile, but his versatility, attacking qualities and 6ft 2in frame would make him a fascinating option. Hancko's agent recently confirmed that Liverpool are looking at his client, who is likely to head elsewhere this summer, but the Reds will have to fend off Paris Saint-Germain to bring him to Anfield.\n\nQuilindschy Hartman\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWhile Hancko marshals the middle of the Feyenoord backline, 22-year-old Netherlands international Quilindschy Hartman acts as the Rotterdam outfit's marauding left-back and has quickly risen to prominence on both the domestic and international scene.\n\nA product of the Feyenoord youth academy since 2010, Hartman boasts seven assists from 38 games in all tournaments this season and also made a strong impression during his Netherlands baptism last year, scoring on his debut in a 2-1 loss to France.\n\nThe full-back then registered an assist in a 6-0 crushing of Gibraltar and was threatening to become Oranje's first-choice left-back for the Euros, but during an Eredivisie clash with Utrecht on March 31, he sustained a devastating cruciate ligament injury.\n\nHartman's issue has dashed his dreams of representing his nation in Germany this summer, and the defender would also be expected to miss the first half of the 2024-25 season, thus making him one of the unlikelier summer transfers.\n\nHowever, the 22-year-old has already made a name for himself as a terrific chance-creator and line-breaker - he averaged 6.36 progressive passes per game before his injury - and across Europe's big five leagues, he is in the top 1% of defenders for shot-creating actions from open play, with three per 90 on average.\n\nUnless Liverpool surprisingly decide to move for him this summer and aid him in his rehabilitation, Hartman could be one to watch for 2025 instead, especially with Andy Robertson now in his 30s and Kostas Tsimikas failing to impress when called upon this season.\n\nMats Wieffer\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nThe overdue midfield rebuild was ostensibly complete last summer, but Liverpool are still believed to be open to the right opportunity in the engine room, especially with Thiago Alcantara out of contract this summer and likely to move on.\n\nCurrent number six Wataru Endo will not be around forever either, and with Alexis Mac Allister preferring the freedom of a more advanced midfield role, Liverpool ought to take a look at Feyenoord's midfield maestro Mats Wieffer.\n\nThe 6ft 2in Netherlands international has garnered a reputation as a Rolls-Royce of a midfielder under Slot's wing, having a direct hand in 10 goals this season - six of his own and four assists - while also mopping up at the base of the midfield.\n\nWieffer averages 1.73 interceptions per game and 1.59 blocked passes per game, and a striking 8.10 ball recoveries per 90 also puts him in the top 2% of midfielders in Europe's big five leagues over the past 365 days.\n\nThe 24-year-old has a penchant for driving runs through the middle too, and he has succeeded with 81.3% of his take-ons over the past year, making it easy to see why Barcelona have supposedly taken a liking to him.\n\nQuinten Timber\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nThe twin brother of Arsenal defender Jurrien Timber - who recently marked his comeback from an ACL injury with a stunning goal for the Gunners' Under-21s - Liverpool fans should welcome Quinten Timber to Anfield with open arms if he shares his sibling's eye for goal.\n\nStatistics from the current campaign show that the 22-year-old certainly does, as he has struck eight of his own while laying on nine assists in 42 matches from the middle of the park, including goals in three Eredivisie games in a row back in November.\n\nA former Ajax youth product who spent one year at Utrecht before a 2022 transfer to Feyenoord - who again only paid a modest fee of \u00a36.4m - Timber's excellent 2023-24 campaign saw Ronald Koeman reward him with his Netherlands debut in their friendly loss to Germany last month.\n\nA strong ball carrier who frequently draws fouls thanks to his on-ball abilities, Timber is only under contract with Feyenoord for another two seasons, and scouts from across Europe have been keeping tabs on his displays this season.\n\nLiverpool are rumoured to be one of the sides doing their due diligence, but a plethora of top continental clubs - including Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Atletico Madrid - could also enter a heated race for his services, especially if he earns a spot on the Dutch plane for Euro 2024 and enjoys a breakthrough tournament.\n\nID:542061:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect15231:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00e1vid_Hancko", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "D\u00e1vid Hancko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangelis_Pavlidis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vangelis Pavlidis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luuk_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luuk de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruz_Azul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruz Azul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Sparta_Prague", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AC Sparta Prague"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S._Lazio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.S.

Replacing Jurgen Klopp is an impossible job. Don't try to emulate him - Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! podcast\n\nNow that it feels like it's almost over, it's hard not to think back at what made it what it was. Jurgen Klopp's eight-and-a-half years at Liverpool have left an indelible mark on the Premier League in a way that goes beyond what was, after all, just a single title.\n\nFor me, the story has often been told in the faces of the opposition. It may be that, more than any individual game, trophy or goal, that will linger the longest.\n\nSome of the best players in the world have suffered through it. That feeling of being tossed about mercilessly and endlessly in Klopp's Anfield washing machine. A feeling of helplessness, a sense that the size of the challenge is just too great, the forces pinning you back too irresistible.\n\nWith that in mind, I think back to Lionel Messi at Anfield on the night of May 7 2019. With the great man's Barcelona team 3-0 down in a Champions League semi-final second leg and on the way to one of the most humbling experiences in their history, the greatest player some of us have ever seen stood over a restart looking utterly bereft. Confused, shellshocked, lost. All of that and more.\n\nThat is what Klopp's Liverpool football did to the best that Europe had to offer during that particularly golden period that brought the Anfield club to three Champions League finals in five years.\n\nIt would be foolish if the next Liverpool boss tried to copy Jurgen Klopp's freestyle football\n\nFacing Klopp's side has at times been so unpredictable it makes it almost impossible to fathom\n\nPodcast All episodes It's All Kicking Off!

Twice in the space of three months in early 2018, in the Premier League and in Europe, and as recently as last month. That particular game ended 1-1 but how Guardiola and his players survived a classic second half onslaught maybe they don't even know.\n\nREAD MORE Mohamed Salah's time at Liverpool 'feels like it's coming to a natural end', says Chris Sutton on 'It's All Kicking Off!'... as he insists Arne Slot will inherit a squad good enough to win the league if he succeeds Jurgen Klopp Advertisement\n\nIt has, in truth, been unique. Klopp has had his ups and downs over his years in England. No manager is immune to the vicissitudes of form and fortune. But over the course of it all, the German's team has played a brand of energetic, instinctive, shockwave football that we have rarely - if ever - seen before in this country.\n\nAt times it has felt as though it has been as much about attitude and ferocity as it has been about football or tactics.\n\nAnd this, looking forward, is what makes the challenge facing Klopp's successor at Anfield so great and so daunting.\n\nIt has been suggested since news broke of Liverpool's efforts to take the Dutch coach Arne Slot out of Feyenoord that the 45-year-old is favoured because he will be able to continue Klopp's work, that he will be able to lead, coach and direct the team in broadly the same way.\n\nI don't buy it. Trying to imitate Klopp would be so foolish and na\u00efve that it's impossible to imagine a coach of any kind of experience even trying it.\n\nListening to Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold talk on a Gary Neville podcast this week, it became clear just how much of what has happened on the field under Klopp has been unscripted. Freestyle football if you like.\n\nFeyenoord's Arne Slot is favoured because it's thought he will be able to continue Klopp's work\n\nWhat has made it so hard to play against at its best has been its chaotic nature. Playing Klopp's Liverpool has at times been so unpredictable as it make it almost impossible to fathom.\n\nKlopp 's eight-and-a-half years at Liverpool have left an indelible mark on the Premier League in a way that goes beyond what was, after all, just a single title, insists Ian Ladyman\n\nFootballers like order. They like to know where the threat is coming from. At times, it has felt as though Liverpool barely knew themselves, only that it would come, and if you have a personality as strong and as deep as Klopp has then you have a chance to pull all that off.\n\nFor years Klopp's greatest trick was to send players out on to the field that were in so many ways psychological extensions of himself. I find it impossible to believe that Slot, or indeed anybody else, would be able to repeat any of this. Take five or ten per cent of that intensity and energy out of Liverpool's football and the engine starts to stall.\n\nSo Klopp's replacement will be under some pressure immediately to find a new way and that presents the greatest challenge.\n\nThere will be much for him to work with. Young talent continues to be promoted from the club's academy. Players signed last summer, such as Alexis MacAllister and Dominik Szoboszlai, can be expected to improve further.\n\nEqually, Liverpool will have an issue to address up front if Mo Salah - a year away from the end of his contract - leaves while the question of just who partners Virgil van Dijk at the centre of the back four raised itself again at Goodison this week as Ibrahima Konate struggled against Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nKlopp's brand of football helped dismantle the best sides in European football during their golden period. Liverpool went on to lift the Champions League in 2019\n\nLiverpool's success has been as much about attitude and ferocity as it has been about tactics\n\nThose are issues of personnel, though. All managers and clubs face those as time rolls by. Slot - if it is to be him - will face questions of identity and philosophy that run much deeper than anything concerning an individual player.\n\nJust how do you take hold of something so personal, bespoke and individual and turn it in to something new, different and at the same time effective? It's an enormous ask. Players like Alexander-Arnold, for example, have only ever known one way, one path.\n\nAt big clubs across England, they have been waiting for Klopp to leave for years. And this is exactly why.\n\nWhy are United haggling over Ashworth?\n\nManchester United are by all accounts miles away from reaching an agreement with Newcastle United for their football director Dan Ashworth.\n\nUnited wish to pay in the region of \u00a32m while Newcastle have a number closer to \u00a315m in mind.\n\nIt's common for big football clubs to behave like this when it comes to paying compensation for managers and executives. This is not just a Manchester United thing.\n\nMan United are not close to reaching an agreement with Newcastle for Dan Ashworth\n\nBut, sticking with United as the example here, why would they be so parsimonious about such an important appointment as Ashworth yet think nothing of handing over \u00a380m for a footballing bum like their Brazilian winger, Antony?\n\nAshworth, if all his publicity is correct, can transform United's wretched recent transfer record pretty much on his own. Antony cannot even transfer a football effectively from A to B.\n\nOdegaard's Norway problem\n\nArsenal's recovery from defeats against Aston Villa and Bayern Munich has been deeply impressive. Mikel Arteta's team ground it out against Wolves then turned on the glitter against Chelsea.\n\nFront and central, as always, has been Martin Odegaard and as I watched him shape the rhythm and tempo of that Chelsea dismantling at the Emirates - his passing beautifully free and destructive - it was hard to escape the feeling that he is now right on the shoulder of Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne as the Premier League's best playmaker.\n\nWhat a shame for him, then, that he will not get to play in this summer's European Championship. In fact, Norway have not reached a major summer finals since Odegaard was 18 months old. He is 25.\n\nImagine having Odegaard and Erling Haaland in your team and finishing six points behind Scotland in qualifying. The mind boggles.\n\nMartin Odegaard (left) is rivalling Kevin de Bruyne as the Premier League's best playmaker\n\nIt boggles the mind how a team with Erling Haaland (left) and Odegaard won't be at the Euros\n\nWhat's really to blame for FA Cup replays being scrapped\n\nSome say there is no longer room in the football calendar for FA Cup replays and they blame the EFL's intransigence over Carabao Cup dates for that.\n\nBut it's not that. It's Europe. That's what gets in the way. Daft ideas like the Europa Conference League. Extra group games in next year's Champions League. That's where the clutter is.\n\nAsked about this, Mansfield Town manager Nigel Clough - whose father tried to win the FA Cup for two decades - was pretty clear.\n\n'There are 92 clubs in the professional game,' Clough said.\n\n'Only six play in Europe.'\n\nQuite.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 45-year-old employs a dynamic and aggressive style of play, which is likely to go down well on Merseyside as a natural continuation of Klopp's philosophy.\n\nFeyenoord's defensive pressing is a particular strength of theirs, with the Dutch giants having enjoyed more success than any other side in Europe this season. They have regained possession in the final third on 722 occasions, according to The Telegraph, putting them ahead of Liverpool's tally of 702.", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "archie_griggs@express.co.uk", "name": "Archie Griggs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/1200x630/5337315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

More often it is slow. A languid No 10, there would have been no place for him in Slot's pressing game. \"He was not the quickest but he had a great touch,\" Rob McDonald tells Sky Sports.\n\nA former striker with Newcastle and PSV, McDonald was the assistant coach at FC Zwolle, Slot's boyhood club. He recently ran into Slot at a game between Feyenoord and Groningen, leading to a brief reunion following a double-take from Slot, a teenager no more.\n\n\"He could play,\" adds McDonald. \"He was always one of these who looked around, a bit like [Paul] Gascoigne, and a bit like a couple of the other top players who had that ability to just keep a good straight body and have a good look around.\"\n\nMcDonald now recruits Dutch coaches for roles around the world but admits he did not necessarily anticipate Slot's coaching career. \"I think he was just absorbing everything if I look back in hindsight.\" That curiosity for coaching came later in his playing days.\n\nWhen Slot returned to Zwolle later in his career, then known as PEC Zwolle, he had become a leader on the field, asking questions, and demanding to understand the tactics. He joined the staff at the club before beginning that coaching journey in earnest at Cambuur.\n\nIt was at Cambuur, under Henk de Jong, and, in particular, Marcel Keizer, a future Ajax coach, that Slot's ideas about how football should be played began to crystallise. He would exchange thoughts with Keizer, the two sharing a video library of matches.\n\nMichel Vonk, the former Manchester City defender who later worked with Slot at AZ Alkmaar, has fond memories of Slot's appetite for the game. \"He spent hours watching videos of the big teams, Barcelona and, of course, Manchester City,\" Vonk tells Sky Sports.\n\n\"Arne is a tremendous football coach who likes to play football in an attacking way.\" Like many top coaches, his commitment to his ideas is total. \"He is like Pep Guardiola,\" adds Vonk. \"He believes in these principles and he lives by them with the team.\"\n\nSlot bonded with Keizer over this enthusiasm for Barcelona's football and when Keizer moved on in October 2016 it was Slot, working with Sipke Hulshoff, who was afforded his chance as a head coach. Jurjan Manners was among his first signings in January.\n\n\"Marcel wanted me in Cambuur. He went to Ajax but told me Arne was there and that I had to go and work with him,\" Mannes tells Sky Sports. \"I went for the negotiations and got the presentation from Arne. Immediately, you knew this is where you wanted to be.\"\n\n\"I was lucky to have a trainer like him in my career,\" says Mannes. Among Slot's many qualities was the clarity of the communication of his tactical ideas. Cambuur usually played on a Friday evening but Slot's team knew the opposition inside out by Tuesday.\n\n\"By then, we already knew they were going to press with three, we were going to build with two defenders and two midfielders dropping back and this was the solution to beat the press. In his sessions, you were already handed the solutions for Friday.\n\n\"What Arne did really well was the clarity of what we were going to do versus what the opponent wants us to do. It was so clear. That was the best thing. When you did video analysis with him or were just speaking about your role, he just simplified everything.\n\n\"He made it really clear what the goal of your position was, what he wanted you to do, what he didn't want you to do. He gave examples using videos, that kind of stuff. It was really clear what he wanted from me, what I had to adjust, and then you just go out and do it.\"\n\nHaving said that, Mannes had other coaches who were clear in their thinking. \"That clarity was not the thing that made him stand out. It was the controlling of space without going one against one.\" If Cambuur had to go to a five to retain an extra defender, they did so.\n\n\"If we did switch, we had prepared six or seven weeks before the game so that the opponent was not expecting it. He is a very clever, smart guy. I think the control he has and the ability to visualise what the opponent is going to do is maybe the best thing that he has.\"\n\nIt was in that first job that Slot began to attract attention because of his accomplishments. Notably, Cambuur, as a second-tier side, defeated Ajax in the KNVB Cup before following that up with a quarter-final win over an Utrecht side coached by Erik ten Hag.\n\nOnly a penalty shoot-out defeat to AZ Alkmaar in the semi-final denied Slot a third victory over elite opposition in that cup run. But even more impressive was their league form that season. Cambuur had been 14th when he took over but he lifted them to third.\n\n\"We were fully dominant,\" says Mannes. Play-off defeat was tough to take. \"We ended up not getting promoted but style-wise we were far from everyone else.\" Slot's departure to take an assistant coaching role at AZ was the next step on his journey to the top.\n\nIt was no surprise to Mannes when AZ came calling. Indeed, the only shock was for the AZ players, whose ideas were soon being challenged by their new assistant coach. \"You could already see the style changing in the first year that Arne was there,\" says Mannes.\n\n\"I know about some really clear presentations he gave to the players almost immediately. There was almost a shock moment for some of the players because he was pointing them in a new direction that they were not used to. Those are the stories that I heard.\"\n\nSlot spent two years as assistant to John van den Brom before the head coach moved on in the summer of 2019. \"I think everyone who was a little close to Arne knew he was going to be the head coach after this.\" It was a leap forward for Slot - and for AZ.\n\nThe following campaign was a fraught one for AZ in some respects. \"We had to deal with so many things that season,\" Pascal Jansen tells Sky Sports. The collapse of a roof at the club's creaking stadium meant having to play home games at an alternative venue.\n\nIt did not prevent Slot leading AZ's impressive title push. Jansen was on Slot's coaching staff at the club before eventually succeeding him. There is still frustration about how that season played out. AZ were level on points with Ten Hag's Ajax with nine games left.\n\n\"We had a big chance because we were in a good phase, a good mood,\" recalls Jansen. \"We were on a roll, had beaten Ajax twice. We were mentally tough, played good football and scored a lot of goals. And then the season stopped.\" It never did restart.\n\n\"If you compare our league to the rest, they had a break and finished the league,\" adds Jansen. \"That is something that the Dutch government did not allow us to do and we will never know how that season would have finished. It was a big frustration.\"\n\nSlot was sacked in December of the following season, amid accusations that he was not fully focused on the team having been negotiating with Feyenoord. It was an unfortunate end but his legacy was strong. \"He spent a lot of time with the youngsters,\" says Vonk.\n\nMore than that, he instituted the attacking game that has become de rigueur across Europe - possession play combined with intense pressing. These were principles that he had begun to put in place at the very start of his coaching career with Cambuur, reveals Mannes.\n\n\"Pressing-wise, his teams are very well organised. At Cambuur, we always felt that we were pressing at a higher intensity than our opponents, pushing them into the areas where we wanted to press them, dominating even when we did not have the ball.\"\n\nIt was similar at AZ. \"He likes his teams to apply pressure on the opponent at any moment,\" says Vonk. \"With that, he understands the importance of being super fit. He makes his team stronger, working them very hard to be able to play by his principles.\n\n\"And because of this high press, his teams have a lot of self-belief. There are principles that underpin his attacking approach. It starts on the training pitch. A lot of video analysis. He is very clear and makes sure he takes his team on the journey with him.\"\n\nFeyenoord was the same story. \"The initial idea is to look forward,\" says McDonald. \"They are not a team that is always playing it backwards or sideways unless the game demands it and they are 1-0 up with a few minutes left. The intentions are always to go forward.\"\n\nMannes regards Slot's success at Feyenoord as a continuation of his work, a continuation of a trend. Since their Eredivisie title win in 2017, the club had not finished in the top two since and were languishing down in seventh spot in the table when he took charge.\n\n\"He took over from Dick Advocaat, a good coach but a coach with a completely different style to Arne. You could see how the team changed, the style, the dominance, the results, the trophies. Arne gets more out of players than a normal coach.\"\n\nThere was progress in his first full season with Feyenoord restored to third before winning the Eredivisie title in 2023. It was achieved playing a brand of football that felt like the future for the club, a victory for Feyenoord and a victory for Slot's vision.\n\nIn the modern game, selling that vision to the players is only part of the job - selling it to the wider world can be just as important. Slot's ability to do that sets his apart from many coaches in the game. \"With the media, I rate him as one of the best,\" says Vonk.\n\nMcDonald remains an admirer of Ten Hag but acknowledges that this is perhaps a key difference between the two Dutch coaches and a reason to believe that Slot is more likely to succeed in the Premier League. \"I think Arne is easier on the ears,\" he says.\n\n\"What I like about Arne is that he is really clear. He does not rush. He does not get hassled. He figures out the questions that the press are trying to put to him and has got them sussed in no time. I think that is one of the main reasons why he has done so well.\"\n\nInterestingly, his old player Mannes makes this same point about Slot working out what to expect from the press ahead of time. \"One thing Arne knows how to deal with is the media. I almost know that he is preparing press conferences as he does with games.\"\n\nSlot has even had the obligatory run-in with Jose Mourinho before becoming Liverpool manager. Slot had praised Napoli but when facing Mourinho's Roma suggested he did not watch so many of their games, preferring to watch Guardiola's teams instead.\n\n\"Mourinho was pretty upset and motivated his team,\" recalls Mannes. \"That probably backfired because they lost against Roma so he will also learn from those things.\" But, as Mannes and many others see it, this playfulness is all part of the man's charm.\n\n\"As a player, you just really believe in him. He is the one you follow. When you go in at half-time, he will give you the little details to turn the game in your favour, you do it and, boom, it happens. You just buy into him. That is also what he does in the media.\"\n\nIt may have bought Slot some time this season because PSV have been the runaway leaders in the Eredivisie, not even losing a game until the 27th week of the season. Feyenoord did win the KNVB Cup but have had to settle for second spot in the table.\n\nSantiago Gimenez, who scored 13 goals in the second half of last season, has only managed three in the same period this time around. \"It has been a bit of a pity that he has not been on the ball because he was scoring for fun before that,\" says McDonald.\n\n\"That has been a problem. Some of those coming in to replace certain players in certain positions have just not been good enough. You can be the best manager in the world but you will still lose.\" And yet, Feyenoord could still surpass last season's points total.\n\nLiverpool are looking beyond trophies when assessing the right person to replace Jurgen Klopp. There is a feeling among those who know Slot and his work that it is the combination of playing style and personality that makes him the right fit.\n\n\"I have no doubt that he can relate to the people, he is tactically good and he is hard if he needs to be,\" says McDonald. \"If there is a problem he will solve it. I think he is a good person to - I cannot believe I am saying this - follow Jurgen Klopp. That is huge.\n\n\"But I like that Arne is an easy-going person and I think that will stand him in good stead in terms of following someone who had such a good relationship with his players. That respect from the players can only be won by training methods and communication.\"\n\nTactically, Vonk thinks that the change can be relatively seamless. \"Most definitely. They are also a team that can be dominant on and off the ball.\" While Mannes is convinced that it is this combination of pressing and passing that makes Slot ideal for Liverpool.\n\n\"I don't follow Liverpool as much as Feyenoord but I know Pep Lijnders.

The Reds were well below their best at Goodison Park and now need Arsenal and Manchester City to stumble in the final weeks of the season.\n\nAttention is already turning to next season with Arne Slot emerging as the new frontrunner to take over from J\u00fcrgen Klopp. The Dutchman has done a fine job at Feyenoord and talks are already underway about moving to Anfield, reports BBC Sport.\n\nAlongside new sporting director Richard Hughes, Liverpool's next manager faces some big decisions in the transfer market. And while contract calls will be needed on the likes of Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, another Reds ace could face an uncertain future.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot takes inspiration from six managers including J\u00fcrgen Klopp and two Liverpool rivals\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool defensive issues broken down as seven players could do more to stop Everton opener\n\nThat is certainly the belief of former defender Jamie Carragher, who isn't convinced Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez is the man to take Liverpool to the next step. The Uruguayan struggled at Goodison Park on Wednesday night and missed a gilt-edged chance in the first-half, firing straight at Jordan Pickford.\n\n\"After two years, I don't think there is going to be a massive improvement in him. He can cause trouble but he is erratic with his finishing. That isn't enough to win the biggest trophies,\" Carragher said on Sky Sports. \"You talk about the first year and these players come in and they're getting up to speed, and you see them improving and getting better.\n\n\"It looked like he was at the start of the season but it has ground to a halt. I think there is a big decision to be made on him in the summer.\"\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez has shown signs of improvements this season. He has already beaten last season's goal tally and provided a further 13 assists. When on song, he is an absolute nightmare for opposition defenses with his running in behind.\n\nHis pace means he can often be deployed out wide on the left and there are few players in Europe who cause anywhere near as much chaos. But when his side needs a cool head in front of goal, he remains anything but.\n\nThe comparisons to the central striker that Slot is working with at Feyenoord are stark. Santiago Gim\u00e9nez, who is two years younger than N\u00fa\u00f1ez, has been a revelation since joining from Cruz Azul in 2022. He has averaged a goal every 0.55 matches since arriving with only two players beating his tally of 21 in the Eredivisie this season.\n\nAdmittedly, the standard of opposition defender is not as high as in the Premier League but it is when provided with the chance to score, that Gim\u00e9nez outshines Liverpool's record signing. N\u00fa\u00f1ez has had more shots than any other player in the Premier League (105) but only found the net 11 times. As per FBref, his shot conversion rate stands at 10.4 per cent.\n\nHis opportunity at Goodison Park took his tally of 'big chances missed' to 26, only beaten by Erling Haaland. Meanwhile, Gim\u00e9nez is proving much more effective, scoring 21 of his 101 shots, to take his conversion rate to 20.8 per cent.\n\nAt just 23, the Feyenoord man still has a lot of developing to do but he is already on the radar of a number of clubs. Real Madrid has been keeping tabs on the Mexico international, as have Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham, reports 90min.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Dutch giants want to keep him. It is believed that any club will have to smash the Eredivisie transfer record, which was set by Manchester United to sign Antony, standing at $93m (\u00a387m/\u20ac100m).\n\nShould Slot get the Anfield job, he could well give Liverpool the upper hand in any potential transfer dealings. You would expect him to want to work with N\u00fa\u00f1ez but if there is no improvement, a replacement could well be sought.", "source": {"uri": "liverpool.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Initially, former midfielder Xabi Alonso seemed poised to take the reins, but his decision to remain at Bayer Leverkusen left a void in the managerial discussion. Sporting CP's Ruben Amorim briefly emerged as a contender, but recent developments suggest a shift in focus towards Feyenoord's Arne Slot, reported by GOAL.\n\nWho is Arne Slot\n\nArne Slot's playing career at FC Zwolle, while not illustrious in terms of trophies, laid the foundation for his coaching journey. His transition from midfielder to coach was evident even during his playing days, with teammates noting his keen tactical insight and leadership on the field. Upon retiring, Slot seamlessly transitioned into coaching, initially at PEC Zwolle's youth level before earning a senior coaching role at AZ Alkmaar.\n\nAt Zwolle, Slot honed his coaching skills, demonstrating a natural understanding for player development and tactical analysis. His meticulous approach to training and innovative tactics caught the attention of AZ Alkmaar, where he was appointed as an assistant coach under John van den Brom. Slot's impact was immediate, contributing to AZ's resurgence in the Eredivisie and earning praise for his tactical contributions.\n\nSlot's time at AZ Alkmaar marked a turning point in his coaching career. When he assumed the role of head coach, AZ Alkmaar was on the verge of a breakthrough, challenging traditional powerhouses like Ajax and PSV Eindhoven for the Eredivisie title. Under Slot's guidance, AZ Alkmaar exhibited a dynamic style of play characterized by fluid attacking movements and relentless pressing. While narrowly missing out on the league title, Slot's impact was undeniable, laying the groundwork for future success.\n\nHis subsequent appointment at Feyenoord started a new chapter in his coaching journey. Tasked with revitalizing a storied club, Slot embraced the challenge with characteristic enthusiasm and ambition. In his first season, Feyenoord experienced a resurgence, finishing third in the Eredivisie and reaching the final of the Europa Conference League. Slot's tactical knowledge and man-management skills were instrumental in transforming Feyenoord into genuine title contenders, earning him widespread acclaim within the footballing community.\n\nArne Slot's vision for football\n\nSlot's tactical approach mirrors that of renowned managers like Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, emphasizing attacking play and high pressing. His teams deploy an expansive 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation, with an emphasis on positional rotations and aggressive pressing to disrupt opponents' build-up play. Slot's commitment to expansive football aligns with Liverpool's style, making him a natural fit for the club.\n\nSlot's tactical philosophy is underpinned by a relentless pursuit of excellence and a commitment to proactive, possession-based football. His teams prioritize ball retention and quick transitions, aiming to dominate possession and create scoring opportunities through dynamic attacking movements. Slot's emphasis on positional play and collective pressing enables his teams to control the tempo of the game and dictate play in key areas of the pitch.\n\nBeyond tactics, Slot's coaching style emphasizes clear communication, player development, and effective man-management. His ability to motivate and inspire players has been praised by former colleagues and players, highlighting his diplomatic approach and great leadership qualities. Slot fosters a positive and inclusive team culture, empowering players to express themselves on the field and take ownership of their performances. His hands-on approach and attention to detail enable him to build strong relationships with players and create a cohesive team environment poised for success.\n\nSlot's unconventional training methods, such as one-touch drills and detailed video analysis, contribute to his players' tactical understanding and overall development. He prioritizes individual improvement and collective cohesion, tailoring training sessions to address specific areas of weakness and maximize the players potential. Slot's holistic approach to player development includes physical, technical, and psychological aspects, ensuring that players are fully prepared to excel on matchday.\n\nSlot's strong personality and unwavering conviction are evident in his interactions with players, fellow managers, and the media. His confrontations with notable figures like Jose Mourinho and Diego Simeone underscore his assertiveness and commitment to his footballing principles. Slot's willingness to challenge established norms and defend his beliefs adds depth to his managerial persona, signaling a coach unafraid of confrontation and driven by a desire for success.\n\nArne Slot's potential impact at Liverpool\n\nAs negotiations between Liverpool and Arne Slot progress, the prospect of Slot leading the club into a new era becomes increasingly high. With his track record of success, innovative tactics, and strong leadership qualities, Slot represents a compelling choice to succeed Jurgen Klopp. While following in Jurgen Klopp's footsteps may be daunting, Slot's confidence, ambition, and footballing philosophy suggest he is more than capable of embracing the challenge head-on.\n\nArne Slot's journey from player to coach has been defined by ambition, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. As he prepares to embark on the next chapter of his managerial career at Liverpool, Slot brings with him a wealth of experience, tactical knowledge, and a winning mentality. With Slot's style and confidence his arrival at Anfield promises a new dawn for the Reds, with the hopes of fixing the holes in their recent form and rise once again as the best team in England.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEC_Zwolle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PEC Zwolle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwolle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zwolle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Simeone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diego Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liverpool-news-Jurgen-Klopps-successor-Arne-Slot-is-the-right-choice.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "2024-03-01", "textStart": 2703, "textEnd": 2710}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

After they lost to Everton on Wednesday, Liverpool's Premier League title challenge is no more.\n\nAs a result, all eyes are now on who FSG will pick as their replacement for Klopp. It has become apparent over the past couple of days that the chosen one is likely to be Arne Slot, currently in charge at Feyenoord.\n\nOther names may yet still come into the fray, with Thomas Frank one who has reportedly been interviewed alongside Slot. But to all intents and purposes, the 45-year-old is the front-runner.\n\nWith Klopp's coaching team also mainly departing, it will be interesting to see who Slot brings with him if he is appointed. For those remaining at Anfield awaiting his arrival, the excitement has already started.\n\nJay Spearing is not part of the first-team coaching staff at Liverpool, although with others soon to depart, maybe that will change.\n\nEither way, it was still interesting to hear what the former player had to say when asked by Stadium Astro who he'd like to see installed as Klopp's successor.\n\n\"Do you know what, those big decision aren't my decisions,\" said the 35-year-old.\n\n\"I'm obviously under 21s, working with the young lads and my decisions are mainly bound by the academy director Alex Inglethorpe.\n\n\"But whoever comes in it will be an absolute privilege to work under. It's been an incredible 18 months, two years for me to work under Jurgen Klopp, Pep Lijnders and Vitor [Matos]. The access we've had to them has been incredible, I've loved every single minute of it.\n\n\"But whoever comes in will be a new challenge, a fresh challenge, but also a new learning time for me. It's a really exciting time, obviously it's disappointing to see Jurgen leave but it will be a new start for the club and a new way of going forward hopefully.\"\n\nThe two coaches that Spearing mentions - Lijnders and Matos - will both be leaving the club with Klopp.\n\nLijnders has most recently been linked with the Besiktas job, while there are claims that he could take Matos to be part of his team.\n\nAlso departing is Peter Krawietz, who rarely seems to get a mention when these things are spoken about. But he'll be a huge loss nonetheless.\n\nAs a result, Slot - or whoever it may be instead - has a big job on to develop their own culture at the club.\n\nIn terms of Slot, it has been reported that he'd be likely to take his assistant - Sipke Hulshoff - along with him. There'll need to be more besides though, so maybe Spearing could throw his hat in the ring for first-team involvement.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brooke@rousingthekop.com", "name": "James Brooke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Inglethorpe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Inglethorpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Spearing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Spearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be\u015fikta\u015f_J.K.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/04/GettyImages-2150020363-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

And he was very interested already [in tactics].\n\n\"He was constantly busy with, with tactics, with exercises. That is Arne, you know. He wants to develop himself so bad, so good. And he has an ambition.\"\n\nIn his heyday, Slot was a midfielder, who played in the top flight of Dutch football. Jenner remembers an intelligent player on the pitch.\n\n\"His biggest strength for me was his unbelievable technique, so technical. He was very, very good. He saw already two or three steps before he wants to do something.\n\n\"He was not fast. Because he was very slow. But he always found the right moment and to recognise where he has to be and that's the big strength of him.\n\n\"With him, he makes your team better in possession.\"\n\nJenner also compares Slot in his prime to a player like Sergio Busquets.\n\n\"He was a very underestimated player because he was not fast, you know, and if you want to compare somebody on the top, he was like Busquets. He was something like that. He was a little faster than Busquets. But he was similar.\"\n\nAfter hanging up his boots, Jenner went into coaching and briefly worked at AZ Alkmaar while Arne Slot was the club's assistant manager.\n\nDuring his time at the club, he observed Arne in action as a manager and was impressed by what he saw.\n\n\"I started to watch his trainings and his trainings are based on a lot of possession game but with very, very high intensity but always with thought. That, I think that makes him exceptional. He loves creativity, and he loves attacking football.\n\n\"I remember that before he went to AZ, he went always to different clubs in different countries to watch training sessions.\"\n\nAccording to Jenner, Slot's playing style closely resembles Pep Guardiola rather than Jurgen Klopp.\n\n\"He is similar to Guardiola. Klopp is power play, gegenpressing to get the ball as fast as possible. But with Arne it's more high-speed ball possession, quickly go to the goal, and he's also not shy to defend, so he knows when we are ahead, we are on the pressure and he is not afraid to change things.\n\n\"He can feel the moment when he has to change [things] in games and he can read the game. He's not shy to make good decisions or brave decisions. That's a gift. Not a lot of coaches have that.\"\n\nHaving observed Slot both as a teammate and as a coach at first-hand, Jenner believes Liverpool could be the perfect next step for the 45-year-old coach.\n\n\"I believe if he makes a step that it will be a very good step for Liverpool as well.\n\n\"After a decade with Klopp he is for me the perfect follow-up coach. I think he can give even more flair to Liverpool. You know what Manchester United had in the past.\n\n\"I believe when Arne goes there [Liverpool] with that kind of style of play. In that public, in my eyes, they will be unbeatable.\"", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julian Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Busquets", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Busquets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAC_Breda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NAC Breda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/04/GettyImages-2149958914-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

He brought through a number of talented players, won three Eredivisie titles and two KNVB Cups. He came seconds away from leading the club to the 2019 Champions League final, having knocked out both Real Madrid and Juventus en route to the semis.\n\nIn recent weeks he's gone on the defensive in his press conferences, pointing out that he's taken Manchester United to three of four domestic cup finals during his two seasons at Old Trafford.\n\nWhile there were some notable question marks - that 7-0 against Liverpool, a very poor away record against top sides - there was plenty to be encouraged about from Ten Hag's first season in English football. He ended United's six-year trophy drought with the League Cup, showed leadership in binning off Cristiano Ronaldo and got them back into the Champions League.\n\nBut he might need to lead United to an unlikely victory over Man City in next month's FA Cup final to salvage something from a much more underwhelming second year.\n\nSome hapless displays resulted in them failing to make it out of their Champions League group, while results in the Premier League have left them almost certain to finish outside the top four. Performances have arguably been ever worse, with underlying numbers painting a picture of a solidly bottom-half side. They might yet register their worst placing and points tally of the Premier League era.\n\nSo there's a degree of logic in looking at their biggest rivals and fearing the same will happen with Slot at Anfield. It is worth considering Jose Mourinho's famous 'football heritage' spiel, however; United have struggled for over a decade since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure and Ten Hag's tenure is merely a continuation of that at a club that have been run questionably - to put it mildly - behind the scenes.\n\nLiverpool have tended to fare considerably better in recent years. And with recruitment specialist Michael Edwards returning to the fore, there's an argument that the hierarchy will give Slot a better chance of success.\n\nLike Ten Hag two years ago, Slot boasts a strong reputation at Feyenoord. He's won at Eredivisie title and a KNVB Cup and led them to the UEFA Conference League finals in 2021-22. He reportedly turned down Leeds and Tottenham last year but is believed to be keen on the opportunity at Liverpool.\n\nTen Hag and Slot actually boast remarkably similar records in the Eredivisie, although the former had more experience with almost a hundred more games under his belt. Slot's win percentage and points-per-game is marginally better, although Ten Hag's side scored at a slightly greater rate and conceded fewer.\n\nHere's how their records in the Dutch top flight stack up against one another.", "source": {"uri": "planetfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planet Football"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nestor_watach@planetfootball.com", "name": "Nestor Watach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd3nfwcxd527z59.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F04%2F25113352%2FErik-ten-Hag-Arne-Slot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Always a struggle the morning after a big game with a big result that generates an understandably big reaction. Thank heavens then for Antony and Arne Slot, we find ourselves saying to our enormous surprise.\n\n'Arsenal have a clear advantage' - Liverpool and Man City warned as title race takes fresh twist\n\nThe implication is simple; that Arsenal have a clear advantage in the freshly-twisted title race after they spanked Chelsea last night, and that Liverpool and City have been warned.\n\nAnd that spanking is the clue as to what's actually happening here. That quote is missing some really pretty important context.\n\nThe full quote from the Independent's Jamie Braidwood is this:\n\nAnd look at that goal difference. Should City fall, Arsenal have a clear advantage over Liverpool if they remain level on points.\n\nWhich is absolutely correct, but by necessity caveated by both a 'should' and an 'if'. It could absolutely prove vital but does not right now and is in no way used to claim that Arsenal have a clear advantage in the actual title race itself at this time.\n\nIn truth, we might not even include this were it just a bit of standard headline mischief-making, but it isn't. The Echo double down in the intro.\n\nThe national media have backed Arsenal as the favourites to win the Premier League following their triumphant 5-0 win over Chelsea.\n\nNo, they absolutely have not. We can see plenty of examples of journalists saying Arsenal have roared back into it, that last week's coronation of Man City might have been premature, and that this was a performance that pours scorn on the idea that Arsenal will choke. All of which is fair enough.\n\nAnnoyingly really for Mediawatch, we're struggling really to take issue with pretty much any of the 'national media' coverage because the overriding 'Arsenal were tremendous and are right in this title race while a Cole Palmer-less Chelsea are entirely rotten' vibe all seems entirely fair and correct.\n\nWe can't find one single journalist saying Arsenal are now favourites - and believe us we'd be delighted if we had, because we'd be putting that dafty straight in here and pointing them towards the latest odds - much less an apparent 'national media' consensus on the issue.\n\n16 Conclusions on Arsenal 5-0 Chelsea: Odegaard, White; Caicedo and Mudryk humbled; Cole Palmer FC\n\nPhilosophical quandary of the day\n\nIf you 'break your silence' in a 'now-deleted rant', have you therefore in fact repaired or restored your silence?\n\nThis is the kind of blind alley down which a slow day has led Mediawatch. With the news dominated by Arsenal thrashing Chelsea, confected nonsense has been hard to come by.\n\nBut luckily for us, there's still Antony. There always is.\n\nAntony breaks silence on his 'horrible' Coventry celebration in post claiming he was DEFENDING Man Utd fans\n\nThat's The Sun there, whose coverage of this particular story rattled our cage so very much yesterday.\n\nToday we're told 'the Brazilian didn't mince his words in his now-deleted rant'.\n\nAnd you've probably already guessed how many times the word 'horrible' is used in said rant or by literally anyone else in The Sun's story today despite those quote marks in the headline.\n\nWe're really quite annoyed about this. But also grateful, in a way, because it's low tide in Mediawatch Bay today.\n\nSlot machine\n\nWe're taking what we can get frankly, and that means a harsh spotlight on some rumblings about Arne Slot as he becomes the third odds-on favourite so far for the Liverpool job. The Mirror have the latest.\n\nLiverpool discover huge compensation fee for Arne Slot as Jurgen Klopp plan progresses\n\nThis sounds like it might be genuinely useful information. Sensible of Liverpool to discover it. But we lose our way as early as the intro.\n\nLiverpool will reportedly have to fork out \u20ac10million (\u00a38.59m) if they decide to appoint Arne Slot as Jurgen Klopp's replacement.\n\n'Reportedly' doesn't sound like something Liverpool have discovered from Feyenoord. It sounds like something someone has reported.\n\nAnd lo, many paragraphs of background and exposition later.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, it would cost Liverpool \u00a38.59m in compensation to appoint the Dutchman\n\nSo Liverpool have discovered this information not by asking Feyenoord but by reading the Daily Mail. Sounds legit.\n\nFour sight\n\nMediawatch is a grumpy nit-picky little bitch today with precious little to go at, so we'll sign off with a suitable bit of snarky unpleasantness that should really be beneath us.\n\nBut we did chuckle at the following excessively cautious line in a Mirror piece about Arne Slot only wanting to leave Feyenoord for another Champions League club.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykhailo_Mudryk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mykhailo Mudryk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Caicedo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felipe Caicedo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slot machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F04%2F23153801%2FArne-Slot-Liverpool.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504405", "eventUri": "eng-9504405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

The reality of it is that we've seen the post-Arsene Wenger era at Arsenal has been difficult. The post-Sir Alex Ferguson era at Manchester United has been difficult. Klopp is massive in Liverpool so they've got to try to get that right.\"\n\nFOLLOW Empire of the Kop on Instagram (@empireofthekop) HERE\n\nHowever, the 48-year-old thinks that the Reds are better equipped to cope with Klopp leaving than United and Arsenal were after the respective exits of Ferguson and Wenger, saying: \"What Manchester United and Arsenal had when they replaced those two managers was a quite traditional, old-school approach, where the managers ran the club.\n\n\"They didn't really have a sporting department beneath them. They were the heads of the sporting department. They were the heads of recruitment, sporting director, manager and coach - all in one.\n\n\"Liverpool have a better setup, with more depth and more structure. There's still going to be an element of risk replacing Klopp with anybody but it has to happen.

Trafford nor Unai Emery at the Emirates Stadium even coming close to replicating the impact of their immediate predecessors.\n\nThat's the challenge which awaits Slot if he's ultimately given the Anfield job, although he'll be fully aware of how tall an order it'll be to follow on immediately from an iconic figure in Klopp.\n\nAt least if he comes to Merseyside, he'll benefit from having some shrewd operators with whom to work, as Neville has referenced.\n\nCEO of Football Michael Edwards is widely regarded as one of the sharpest boardroom executives in world football, while new sporting director Richard Hughes arrives from Bournemouth with a glowing reputation.\n\nLiverpool are facing into a period of uncertainly after Klopp, that's for sure, but at least there's a strong backroom

This seemingly catapulted Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim into prime contention, however Liverpool's interest appears to have cooled more recently, with the Portuguese now looking more likely to succeed David Moyes at West Ham if he is to make a Premier League switch at all.\n\nIn recent days, the vacuum created by this surprise turn has been filled by Feyenoord's Arne Slot.

Dr. Tyler Wenzel, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Saskatchewan, is conducting research that could revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat diseases of the brain. Using stem cells found in blood, Wenzel says he found a way to grow small, yet highly functional \u201cmini-brains,\u201d which can simplify the diagnosis of things like Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cYou actually can\u2019t confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease until the patient passes away, because you have to do an autopsy. So this could potentially, given enough patient samples and a large enough population size, we could actually maybe confirm diagnosis before death.\u201d The mini-brains provide a much more realistic example of brain tissue than that of mice or already deceased individuals. A clearer image of brain tissue lets Wenzel and his team see the effects of brain disease in more detail, bringing to light things that would have been missed using other tissue. These mini-brains are grown from blood alone, using stem cells to grow three-millimetre-long clusters that resemble the patient\u2019s brain nearly identically. Growing the mini-brains from blood means those living in rural areas can save time, money and energy in getting a diagnosis or treatment for diseases of the brain. Patients can visit a blood clinic or local hospital and the collected blood can be shipped to a lab for analysis regardless of location. The usual six- to eight-month process for diagnosis or treatment is dropped down to around two months. Though the analysis process is still a matter of months, Wenzel says it\u2019s about getting people the care they need. \u201cIf we could diagnose in about two months, then we can get patients on treatments a lot sooner and they can start getting care sooner, which should hopefully improve their quality of life.\u201d Wenzel\u2019s mini-brains have all the cell types present in a typical human brain. While mouse brain tissue is from a completely different species and cadaver tissue is already dead, the mini-brains can send and receive signals as though they were in a live person\u2019s skull. The mini-brains\u2019 simplicity was also one of the most complex challenges in proving Wenzel\u2019s theory that you can grow functioning brain tissue from stem cells. Unless looked at under a microscope, the brain tissue just looks like regular tissue. It wasn\u2019t until skeptics saw the folds in the brain tissues that others from academia began to support the idea. Kaleta Strain, CEO of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society of Saskatchewan, says Wenzel\u2019s research is a welcome sign of hope to those afflicted with brain disease. \u201cIt\u2019s always exciting to know the difference that it could make for people living with dementia and really driving towards that hope that one day we can find a cause and a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementia.\u201d Though Wenzel\u2019s research is still a newer concept, the initial results from tests are extremely promising. With enough time and study, the research could very well lead to treatments and cures for brain diseases thought incurable.", "summary": "Dr. Tyler Wenzel, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Saskatchewan, is conducting research that could revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat diseases of the brain.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10538145/university-of-saskatchewan-research-brain-disease-mini-brains-alzheimers/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MINI-BRAINS00000000.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:16", "author": "Joshua Gwozdz", "authors": ["Joshua Gwozdz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.231}

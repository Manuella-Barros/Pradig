She said she doesn't believe in religious programmes. According to her, if religious programmes were what a nation needs, Nigeria would have been one of the greatest countries in the world. The reality star said Nigerians spend \"too much\" time praying instead of working and being good human beings. She stated this on her Snapchat page while responding to a fan who asked why she never connects to any of the religious programmes online. Doyin wrote: \"I get a lot of those hallelujah challenge and what God cannot do doesn't exist tags. People keep sending them to me but I just don't believe in that type of stuff so I never join. \"It's not bad... I just don't believe in it.\" In another post, the reality star wrote: \"If it were really by 'hallelujah challenge' and 'what God cannot do'.....Nigeria should be one of the greatest countries by now. We spend too much time praying and shouting hallelujah instead of actually working and being actual good human beings. \"They will shout hallelujah finish and go back to cheating the next person they encounter or judging someone because the person presents themselves differently. \"To me, it's just a complete waste of time but to each his own. If you believe in it then by all means. At the end of the day, all that should matter is having a good relationship with God and being a good human being. \"If you like, shout hallelujah from now till next year. If you don't find ways to improve yourself and provide value....you'll keep shouting hallelujah in hunger.\"", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Doyin.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Doyin.jpg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Doyin-300x250.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Doyin-1024x853.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>Controversial Big Brother Naija reality star Doyinsola Anuoluwapo David, simply known as Doyin, has shared her religious views.

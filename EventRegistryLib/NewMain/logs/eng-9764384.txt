Following his reboot of The Twilight Zone, Peele's production company Monkeypaw has now turned its attention to Scare Tactics. The hidden camera horror-comedy prank show previously aired on SyFy (at the time, the Sci-Fi Channel). This new iteration will move over to another NBCUniversal channel, USA Network, under the supervision of Universal Television Alternative Studio, Monkeypaw Productions, and WMTI Productions, Inc, per Variety.\n\nScare Tactics \"will turn unsuspecting individuals into the main characters of their very own horror movies,\" according to a synopsis. \"This heart-pounding show offers a cinematic approach to the hidden camera concept. Set up by their friends and family, these unwitting participants are put in hilariously twisted scenarios with fully immersive stories that blur the lines of reality, horror and comedy. As they navigate one unreal decision after another, audiences will laugh, jump and be left breathless for more.\"\n\nThe original series ran for five seasons, with some hiatuses in between, from 2003 to 2013. The first season was hosted by the late Shannen Doherty, who was replaced by Stephen Baldwin midway through the second season. Tracy Morgan took over hosting duties in the third season. No host has yet been announced for the new version, though perhaps Morgan would still be up for it (he's got a Monkeypaw connection through his series The Last O.G., which was co-created by Peele). \"I was always a fan of it. I watched it. I love it,\" he told The A.V. Club back in 2008. \"And besides, they called my people and they asked me, would I do it? And I said, 'Absolutely, yes.' Cause I'm a big fan of The Twilight Zone, too, so I see that as running along the same lines. So this was my chance, my opportunity, to be like Rod Serling.\" He added: \"It's funny. It's fun to watch other people get frightened like that. It's fun. It's not happening to me. [Laughs.] I enjoy watching it. It's great entertainment. It's good TV.\"\n\nBack in 2020, there was a bit of legal trouble for the Scare Tactics team when creator Steve Hallock sued his co-creator Kevin Healey for creating a similar program on Netflix (Prank Encounters). Their lawsuit was apparently settled in 2023, but their creative partnership had dissolved long before that, with Hallock getting ownership of the brand. Hallock is now flying solo on the new show. \"Reimagining Scare Tactics with Jordan, Monkeypaw and UTAS has been a dream come true,\" Hallock said in a statement (via Variety). \"Fans have been asking us to bring Scare Tactics back for years, and working with this team was an amazing opportunity.

One of the more undersung creations during that stretch was Syfy's Scare Tactics, the only show on TV where the point was to make someone dampen and darken their pants in fear, all for the comedy! Now, Jordan Peele is utilizing his horror and comedy expertise to resurrect Scare Tactics for 2024 audiences.\n\nThat's right, this year's audiences. This isn't some lofty pipe dream that audiences will need to wait on for ages. The latest take on Scare Tactics will premiere on USA Network during the Fall 2024 TV schedule, and it's being called \"an audacious reimagining of the popular prank series.\" If Jordan Peele is behind it in any capacity, it's going to take a new approach to whatever the subject matter might be. In this case, it's making someone believe they're caught up in an alien encounter or a serial killer's warpath, among other terrifying situations.\n\nWith Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw Productions behind it, Scare Tactics gives unwitting subjects a chance to appear in their own horror movie of sorts as they participate in what they believe are normal situations, only to have everything get twisted around when they least expect it. It's hard to compare it 1:1 with similar shows like Punk'd or Candid Camera, because it really is all about the turns when things turn horrific. Such as it goes in the classic clip below.\n\nIt's not clear at the moment if Jordan Peele will serve as the on-screen host when Scare Tactics debuts, or if he'll remain a behind-the-scenes creative. But with Monkeypaw behind it, the quality will no doubt match up with past productions such as the instant \"best horror movie\" candidates like Get Out, Us and Nope, not to mention USA and Syfy's current horror fan-fave Chucky.\n\nOMG, can we expect to see Chucky himself show up on Scare Tactics in some way? Maybe HE could be the host. All the potential...\n\nCalling it an \"all-time favorite hidden-camera show\" amongst the studio's staff, Monkeypaw President Win Rosenfeld described the new show as such:\n\nAs someone who generally doesn't enjoy the vast majority of prank shows, Scare Tactics always spoke as much to my horror fandom as anything, given how impressive the production design and effects would be for each of the scenarios. Plus, there's that catharsis he mentioned, where participants come out the other side of the experience a bit upset, but also possibly having achieved at a new level of relief than they've ever felt.\n\nScare Tactics began back in 2003 on Syfy, with Season 1 hosted by the late Shannen Doherty, and Season 2 fronted by Stephen Baldwin. Tracy Morgan took over as host in later seasons. In 2017, Blumhouse TV was announced to be developing a reboot, but it doesn't appear anything came out of that.\n\nA show whose resurgence is always welcomed via streaming or a Jordan Peele-produced reboot, Scare Tactics will arrive on USA Network this fall.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_venable@cinemablend.com", "name": "Nick Venable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_Tactics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scare Tactics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Peele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Brother (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackass_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackass (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkeypaw_Productions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monkeypaw Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syfy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Practical joke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chucky_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chucky (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candid_Camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candid Camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk'd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk'd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nope_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nope (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumhouse_Productions", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blumhouse Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tracy Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannen_Doherty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shannen Doherty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2wjv7v2pEWmLBmkjEsb9y4-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764384", "eventUri": "eng-9764384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

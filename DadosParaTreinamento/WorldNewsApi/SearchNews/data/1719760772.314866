Vaping has become a concerning trend with figures from the Office for National Statistics showing that 4.5 million Brits admit to using e-cigarettes daily. While many people use these devices to wean themselves off of cigarettes, a leading doctor has shared his worries on the rising amount of people vaping as a habit instead of smoking. Dr Ahmed Ezzat, who posts under the handle @drmishmash, said: \"Who would have thought that back in the 1920s to 1940s, doctors on every billboard were trying to promote smoking cigarettes, even claiming, with the tobacco companies, that smoking cigarettes cured or treated asthma and shortness of breath. \"If anyone was to the say that now it would be absolutely farcical. So in the same way, we\u2019re kind of seeing history repeat itself.\" The London-based general surgery registrar says there are lots of parallels between cigarettes and vapes \u2013 electronic devices designed to allow people to inhale nicotine in a vapour, which are available with or without nicotine. \u201cIf you look at smoking, it took 40 years [to see the health implications]. Let\u2019s wait another few decades and see what happens with vaping. \u201cJust because there isn\u2019t enough evidence yet to prove that it\u2019s harmful, it doesn\u2019t mean in any way that there is no harm,\u201d he says. \u201cThey could be very harmful, and that the effects won\u2019t be known until 20 or 30 years from now.\u201d It\u2019s part of a new drive by TikTok to provide factual information from trusted sources about the potential dangers of vaping and direct people who want to quit towards the organisation Talk To Frank. With over 154,000 posts on TikTok under #vaping and 14,000 posts under #quitvaping, it\u2019s discussed a lot on the social media site, and creators like Dr Emeka Okorocha (@Doctor.Emeka) and medical student Christina Aaliyah (@christina.aaliyah) have also been working on the campaign to educate users. \"There\u2019s been a rise in trend in the number of younger kids who are trying and then picking up vaping, says Ezzat. \u201cThese are children because they\u2019re under 18, have never smoked cigarettes before.\u201d NHS figures from 2022 show that nine per cent of 11 to 15-year-olds vaped at the time, and for 15-year-olds, the number is as high as one in five. Last week, new figures from Cancer UK showed that the rise in vaping was greatest in people who had never smoked, rising from two per cent in July 2016 to nine per cent in May 2023 for 18 to 24-year-olds. The colours and flavours of disposable vapes in particular may attract children and young people to buy them. \u201cPeople buying these very cheap \u00a32 vapes that are colourful that I see at every bus stop. These are kids coming out of schools. \u201cThese flavours normalise it, instead of somebody buying, say chewing gum or chocolate, they buy a vape that is perceptually seen as being cool.\u201d And vaping among adults isn\u2019t helping either. \u201cIncreasingly, you\u2019re seeing parents vaping around children, even in playgrounds, and because they perceive it as \u2018not smoking\u2019.\u201d This is where there is a \u201ccultural confusion\u201d, Ezzat says. \u201cThere\u2019s a matrix where people haven\u2019t quite registered that vaping is smoking and vaping is just as bad. \u201cBut \u2013 and this is where it becomes tricky \u2013 vaping has a use, but it certainly is not for children or those who\u2019ve never smoked before,\u201d he says. \u201cThe NHS recommends vaping for those in a controlled way for those who are trying to stop cigarette smoking and can\u2019t stop. [For] individuals who are addicted to smoking, vaping absolutely has a use under a regulated way, in consultation with a doctor.\u201d", "summary": "Medical experts have taken to TikTok to warn young people of the risks associated with vaping.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/doctor-issues-vaping-warning-danger-32915875", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32916791.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ezgif-1-a365659391.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:58:26", "author": "Abbie Meehan,Lauren Taylor PA", "authors": ["Abbie Meehan", "Lauren Taylor PA"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.266}

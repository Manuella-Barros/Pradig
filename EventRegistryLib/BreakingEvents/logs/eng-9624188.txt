Masters champion Scottie Scheffler was detained by police Friday morning on his way to the PGA Championship, with stunning images showing him handcuffed as he was led to a police car.\n\nDUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Masters champion Scottie Scheffler said he knew five days in advance that charges related to his arrest during the PGA Championship were going to be dismissed. In his mind, that wasn't the end of the saga but rather the beginning of trying to put it behind him.\n\nCriminal charges were dismissed on May 29, nearly two weeks after images emerged of the world's No. 1 golfer being arrested and handcuffed outside Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nScheffler said his attorney told him on May 24 that dropping the charges had become a formality because \"we had a lot of evidence on our side.\" But that didn't mean he had moved past it.\n\n\"The charges are dropped, but I still ... now it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it,\" Scheffler said Tuesday ahead of the Memorial. \"And to be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course.\n\n\"It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always kind of stick with me,\" he said. \"That mug shot, I'm sure is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nEven with the U.S. Open approaching, images are still hard to forget of Scheffler in gym shorts and a T-shirt being led to a police car in handcuffs.\n\nThe case stemmed from a fatal accident involving a pedestrian, John Mills. Scheffler was charged with a felony for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle, along with three misdemeanors, after police alleged he did not follow instructions.\n\nThe arresting officer said he was dragged by Scheffler's car and suffered minor injuries.\n\nA surveillance video released by Louisville police last week showed Detective Bryan Gillis pursuing Scheffler's vehicle on foot and stopping him from entering the course. Scheffler is later pulled from the car and handcuffed. But the video did not show Gillis' first contact with Scheffler, authorities said.\n\nScheffler's mug shot from jail made its way onto shirts during the final three days of the PGA Championship. He was released in time to make his tee time for the second round and shot 66 to get into contention. He finished the week tied for eighth.\n\nHis attorney, Steve Romines, said the day charges formally were dismissed that there were grounds for a civil lawsuit against Louisville police. He said Scheffler was not interested in pursuing litigation.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said. \"I don't really know how to describe it, but basically if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right.\"\n\nScheffler played the following week at Colonial and did not speak to the media. This was his first news conference since the charges were dismissed.\n\nHe said his only other run-in with the law has been a couple of speeding tickets.\n\n\"I think that's part of the recovery process from the whole scenario, is your brain tries to figure out how this happened, and I will probably never figure out why or how this happened,\" he said. \"But it's just one of those deals that it will always be kind of ingrained in my season this year.

In his mind, that wasn't the end of the saga but rather the beginning of trying to put it behind him.\n\nCriminal charges were dismissed on May 29, nearly two weeks after images emerged of the world's No. 1 golfer being arrested and handcuffed outside Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nScheffler said his attorney told him on May 24 that dropping the charges had become a formality because \"we had a lot of evidence on our side.\" But that didn't mean he had moved past it.\n\n\"The charges are dropped, but I still ... now it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it,\" Scheffler said Tuesday ahead of the Memorial. \"And to be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course.\n\n\"It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always kind of stick with me,\" he said. \"That mug shot, I'm sure is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nEven with the U.S. Open approaching, images are still hard to forget of Scheffler in gym shorts and a T-shirt being led to a police car in handcuffs.\n\nThe case stemmed from a fatal accident involving a pedestrian, John Mills, an employee of a PGA Championship vendor who was hit by a shuttle bus near the entrance to Valhalla Golf Club.\n\nScheffler was trying to drive around the traffic that resulted from the accident scene on his way into the course. He was charged with a felony for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle, along with three misdemeanors, after police alleged he did not follow instructions.\n\nThe arresting officer said he was dragged by Scheffler's car and suffered minor injuries.\n\nA surveillance video released by Louisville police last week showed Detective Bryan Gillis pursuing Scheffler's vehicle on foot and stopping him from entering the course. Scheffler is later pulled from the car and handcuffed. But the video did not show Gillis' first contact with Scheffler, authorities said.\n\nScheffler's mug shot from jail made its way onto shirts during the final three days of the PGA Championship. He was released in time to make his tee time for the second round and shot 66 to get into contention. He finished the week tied for eighth.\n\nHis attorney, Steve Romines, said the day charges formally were dismissed that there were grounds for a civil lawsuit against Louisville police. He said Scheffler was not interested in pursuing litigation.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said. \"I don't really know how to describe it, but basically if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right.\"\n\nScheffler played the following week at Colonial and did not speak to the media. This was his first news conference since the charges were dismissed.\n\nHe said his only other run-in with the law has been a couple of speeding tickets.\n\n\"I think that's part of the recovery process from the whole scenario, is your brain tries to figure out how this happened, and I will probably never figure out why or how this happened,\" he said. \"But it's just one of those deals that it will always be kind of ingrained in my season this year.

He faced four charges, including one felony, for the incident that occurred outside of Valhalla Golf Club that led to his arrest.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because, like I said, there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said, referencing his Louisville attorney, Steve Romines. \"There was eyewitnesses on the scene that corroborated my story and the video evidence, the police officer talking to me after.\n\n\"All the evidence pointed to exactly what my side of the story was, and so if we needed to ... I don't really know how to describe it, but basically, if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right. So at no point did I ever want to sue them, but if it came there, I think my lawyer was more than prepared to use that as more of like a bargaining chip-type thing more than anything.\"\n\nA pedestrian, John Mills, was struck and killed by a shuttle bus on his way to working at the tournament around 5 a.m., leading to a massive police presence and traffic backups.\n\nPlayers and officials were allowed into the entrance of Valhalla Golf Club but Scheffler ran afoul of police officer Bryan Gillis, who directed Scheffler to stop and ended up arresting the golfer after he was said to not follow orders. Scheffler maintained he was not aware of the reason for the traffic issues.\n\nAmong the charges was a felony, second-degree assault of a police officer; Gillis alleged in his police report that Scheffler dragged him as he asked him to stop the car.\n\nSubsequent video shows Scheffler being interviewed in a car by another officer and saying \"he was hitting me with his flashlight\" and while admitting he should have stopped, believed that Gillis was \"overly aggressive.\"\n\nIn a matter of minutes, Scheffler was arrested and handcuffed and taken to a local jail, where he awaited his fate. Tee times for the second round had been delayed due to the fatality, and Scheffler made it back to the course with less than an hour before he was to start, shooting 66 before falling out of contention on Saturday. He ended up tied for eighth.\n\nHe played the following week at the Charles Schwab Challenge, where he finished second, and only then did he begin to feel that the matter would be resolved.\n\n\"I would say that I still wouldn't have a hundred percent moved past it because the charges are dropped, but I still -- now it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it and ask me about the situation and, to be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"And so it's not something that I love talking about and it's something that I'm hoping to move past, but when the charges are dropped, that's kind of only the beginning of kind of getting past it, if that makes sense. So kind of operating through that now.

Despite the charges being dropped, people will always remember 'that time Scottie Scheffler got arrested at the 2024 PGA Championship.'\n\nThe fact that his mugshot was released, and the internet never forgets, also plays a role in him never fully being able to move past the situation.\n\n\"It's not something that I love talking about and it's something that I'm hoping to move past, but when the charges are dropped, that's kind of only the beginning of kind of getting past it, if that makes sense,\" Scheffler continued. \"So kind of operating through that now. It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always, I think, kind of stick with me. That mug shot, I'm sure is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nScheffler was originally charged with second-degree assault of a police officer (a felony), criminal mischief, reckless driving, and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.\n\nAll charges against him were dropped the same day that a video from an officer who spoke with Scheffler on the scene recorded his side of the story of what exactly took place outside an entrance to Valhalla.\n\nA question many were asking was whether Scheffler and his legal team would have pursued legal action against the Louisville Police Department if the case carried on. He explained that his lawyer, Steve Romines, was prepared to go down that avenue, but personally, he never hoped it would reach that point.\n\n\"For me personally, no. That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because, like I said, there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said. \"There was eyewitnesses on the scene that corroborated my story and the video evidence, the police officer talking to me after. All the evidence pointed to exactly what my side of the story was, and so if we needed to, if it -- if I kind of became, like -- I don't really know how to describe it, but basically, if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\"\n\n\"But at the end of the day, I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right. So at no point did I ever want to sue them, but if it came there, I think my lawyer was more than prepared to use that as more of like a bargaining chip-type thing more than anything.\"", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Metro_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Metro Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckless_driving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reckless driving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/scheffler-speaks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624188", "eventUri": "eng-9624188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 394, "textEnd": 400}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

Scheffler was charged with a felony for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle, along with three misdemeanors, after police alleged he did not follow instructions.\n\nThe arresting officer said he was dragged by Scheffler's car and suffered minor injuries.\n\nA surveillance video released by Louisville police last week showed Detective Bryan Gillis pursuing Scheffler's vehicle on foot and stopping him from entering the course. Scheffler is later pulled from the car and handcuffed. But the video did not show Gillis' first contact with Scheffler, authorities said.\n\nScheffler's mug shot from jail made its way onto shirts during the final three days of the PGA Championship. He was released in time to make his tee time for the second round and shot 66 to get into contention. He finished the week tied for eighth.\n\nHis attorney, Steve Romines, said the day charges formally were dismissed that there were grounds for a civil lawsuit against Louisville police.

He faced four charges, including one felony, for the incident that occurred outside of Valhalla Golf Club that led to his arrest.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because, like I said, there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said, referencing his Louisville attorney, Steve Romines. \"There was eyewitnesses on the scene that corroborated my story and the video evidence, the police officer talking to me after.\n\n\"All the evidence pointed to exactly what my side of the story was, and so if we needed to ...

Scheffler maintained he was not aware of the reason for the traffic issues.\n\nAmong the charges was a felony, second-degree assault of a police officer; Gillis alleged in his police report that Scheffler dragged him as he asked him to stop the car.\n\nSubsequent video shows Scheffler being interviewed in a car by another officer and saying \"he was hitting me with his flashlight\" and while admitting he should have stopped, believed that Gillis was \"overly aggressive.\"\n\nIn a matter of minutes, Scheffler was arrested and handcuffed and taken to a local jail, where he awaited his fate. Tee times for the second round had been delayed due to the fatality, and Scheffler made it back to the course with less than an hour before he was to start, shooting 66 before falling out of contention on Saturday. He ended up tied for eighth.\n\nHe played the following week at the Charles Schwab Challenge, where he finished second, and only then did he begin to feel that the matter would be resolved.\n\n\"I would say that I still wouldn't have a hundred percent moved past it because the charges are dropped, but I still -- now it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it and ask me about the situation and, to be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"And so it's not something that I love talking about and it's something that I'm hoping to move past, but when the charges are dropped, that's kind of only the beginning of kind of getting past it, if that makes sense. So kind of operating through that now. It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always kind of stick with me.\n\n\"That mug shot, I'm sure is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nIn a lighter moment, Scheffler was asked if he'd ever gotten a parking ticket or any kind of traffic violation previous to the Louisville incident.\n\n\"I have had a couple speeding tickets,\" Scheffler said. \"My dad used to make fun of me because I had -- my dad's really good with words, and so if he's -- I've watched him get pulled over a couple times and not get a ticket. I've been pulled over a couple times and I'm batting a hundred percent on getting tickets.\n\n\"So, yeah, I've had a few speeding tickets, a parking ticket, maybe. I can't remember the last time I was in a fight or anything like that.\n\n\"I think that's part of also kind of the recovery process from the whole scenario, is your brain tries to figure out how this happened, and I will probably never figure out why or how this happened, but it's just one of those deals that it will always be kind of ingrained in my season this year, but with time, people will forget.\"\n\nBOB HARIG\n\nBob Harig is a golf writer for SI.com and the author of the book \"DRIVE: The Lasting Legacy of Tiger Woods,\" which publishes in March and can be ordered here.\n\nFollow si_golf", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_harig@postandcourier.com", "name": "Bob Harig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Metro_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Metro Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Invitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonial National Invitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Traffic_Control", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Traffic Control", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/1c/f1ceb839-b6f6-5dcd-9c35-0c7a0806d680/665f3b9adb6a6.image.jpg?crop=1440%2C756%2C0%2C26&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624188", "eventUri": "eng-9624188", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 237}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

'This was a chaotic situation for everyone involved. Ensuring the safety of everyone in the vicinity was my utmost priority.\n\n'Mr. Scheffler and I both agree that there will be no ill will over this going forward.

In his mind, that wasn't the end of the saga but rather the beginning of trying to put it behind him.\n\nCriminal charges were dismissed on May 29, nearly two weeks after images emerged of the world's No. 1 golfer being arrested and handcuffed outside Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nScheffler said his attorney told him on May 24 that dropping the charges had become a formality because \"we had a lot of evidence on our side.\" But that didn't mean he had moved past it.\n\n\"The charges are dropped, but I still ... now it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it,\" Scheffler said Tuesday ahead of the Memorial. \"And to be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Scheffler was charged with a felony for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle, along with three misdemeanors, after police alleged he did not follow instructions.\n\nThe arresting officer said he was dragged by Scheffler's car and suffered minor injuries.\n\nA surveillance video released by Louisville police last week showed Detective Bryan Gillis pursuing Scheffler's vehicle on foot and stopping him from entering the course. Scheffler is later pulled from the car and handcuffed. But the video did not show Gillis' first contact with Scheffler, authorities said.\n\nScheffler's mug shot from jail made its way onto shirts during the final three days of the PGA Championship. He was released in time to make his tee time for the second round and shot 66 to get into contention. He finished the week tied for eighth.\n\nHis attorney, Steve Romines, said the day charges formally were dismissed that there were grounds for a civil lawsuit against Louisville police. He said Scheffler was not interested in pursuing litigation.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said. \"I don't really know how to describe it, but basically if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right.\"\n\nScheffler played the following week at Colonial and did not speak to the media.

Scheffler was charged with a felony for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle, along with three misdemeanors, after police alleged he did not follow instructions.\n\nThe arresting officer said he was dragged by Scheffler's car and suffered minor injuries.\n\nA surveillance video released by Louisville police last week showed Detective Bryan Gillis pursuing Scheffler's vehicle on foot and stopping him from entering the course.

He said Scheffler was not interested in pursuing litigation.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said. \"I don't really know how to describe it, but basically if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right.\"\n\nScheffler played the following week at Colonial and did not speak to the media.

That mugshot I'm sure is not going anywhere any time soon.\"\n\nScheffler confirmed the assertion of his attorney, Steve Romines, that he had decided not to sue the Louisville Metro Police Department because it would be the city's taxpayers who would ultimately \"pay for whatever occurred\".\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because, at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department and that just doesn't seem right,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"So at no point did I ever want to sue them, but if it came there, I think my lawyer was more than prepared to use that as more of like a bargaining chip-type thing more than anything.\n\n\"I think sometimes in society people are expecting perfection out of everybody and just because somebody will make one mistake, people will crucify them for that and I've never really believed in that. I believe in forgiveness, I believe in grace and I try to give that out as much as possible because of how much grace I've been given.\"\n\nScheffler has finished third in his previous two appearances at Muirfield Village and will be chasing a sixth PGA Tour win of the season, with the world No 1 then set to be the pre-tournament favourite again the following week at the US Open.\n\n\"I'm always preparing for the next week and I'm trying to manage my practice to where I'm trying to get a little bit better each day, and I think the majors are always kind of earmarked in my head on the calendar,\" Scheffler added.\n\n\"I try to block them out, but the majors are always in the back of my head.

Scheffler was charged with a felony for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle, along with three misdemeanors, after police alleged he did not follow instructions.\n\nThe arresting officer said he was dragged by Scheffler's car and suffered minor injuries.\n\nA surveillance video released by Louisville police last week showed Detective Bryan Gillis pursuing Scheffler's vehicle on foot and stopping him from entering the course. Scheffler is later pulled from the car and handcuffed. But the video did not show Gillis' first contact with Scheffler, authorities said.\n\nScheffler's mug shot from jail made its way onto shirts during the final three days of the PGA Championship. He was released in time to make his tee time for the second round and shot 66 to get into contention. He finished the week tied for eighth.\n\nHis attorney, Steve Romines, said the day charges formally were dismissed that there were grounds for a civil lawsuit against Louisville police. He said Scheffler was not interested in pursuing litigation.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said. \"I don't really know how to describe it, but basically if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right.\"\n\nScheffler played the following week at Colonial and did not speak to the media. This was his first news conference since the charges were dismissed.\n\nHe said his only other run-in with the law has been a couple of speeding tickets.\n\n\"I think that's part of the recovery process from the whole scenario, is your brain tries to figure out how this happened, and I will probably never figure out why or how this happened,\" he said. \"But it's just one of those deals that it will always be kind of ingrained in my season this year.

All the evidence pointed to exactly what my side of the story was, and so if we needed to, if it -- if I kind of became, like -- I don't really know how to describe it, but basically, if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\"\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right. So at no point did I ever want to sue them, but if it came there, I think my lawyer was more than prepared to use that as more of like a bargaining chip-type thing more than anything.\"\n\nAt least one element of that day, though, allows Scheffler to smile.\n\n\"That mug shot, I'm sure, is not going anywhere anytime soon,\" Scheffler said.\n\nThe world's No. 1 golfer will compete at this week's Memorial Tournament before pursuing his third major win at the U.S. Open beginning Thursday, June 13.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Metro_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Metro Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-q9gf3xivk-1717520670892.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717506317&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624188", "eventUri": "eng-9624188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 95, "textEnd": 101, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1141}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 3591, "textEnd": 3598}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

So, I'm operating through that now. It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always, I think, stick with me. That mug shot, I'm sure, is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nThe image of Scheffler standing in an orange jumpsuit immediately went viral, as fans even showed up to Valhalla wearing t-shirts with the mugshot printed across their chests.\n\nHowever, six days after his arrest, Louisville Police released video footage of the incident, which appeared to show Scheffler doing nothing wrong. He labeled the incident a \"big misunderstanding,\" which corroborates with the video evidence. Nevertheless, the officer who detained Scheffler did not have his body camera activated during what was a hectic and tragic morning outside of Valhalla.\n\nYet, Scheffler did not disparage anyone nor show any sign of frustration during the incident and immediately after his second round -- just hours after his mugshot exploded online. The same sentiments rang true on Tuesday, as Scheffler wants to put this whole ordeal to rest.\n\n\"I did not want to pursue legal action against Louisville because, at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"So, at no point did I ever want to sue them, but if it came up, I think my lawyer was more than prepared to use that as more of a bargaining chip-type thing.\"\n\nWith all of this in the rearview mirror, Scheffler can now focus on his faith, his young family, and his golf game, which is the best in the world.\n\nStill, while continuing to reflect on this entire ordeal, Scheffler provided a lesson about forgiveness. He will pass this on to his son one day, and it's a lesson that all of us can learn from, too.\n\n\"I try to believe that people are innocent until proven guilty. Just because somebody's accused of something doesn't mean that they actually did it, or maybe they did do it, and maybe they just made a mistake,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"I think forgiveness is something that's lost in our society, and just because somebody made a mistake at one point in their life doesn't mean that they're a bad person. I think sometimes in society, people expect perfection out of everybody, and just because somebody makes one mistake, people will crucify them for that. I've never really believed in that. I believe in forgiveness, I believe in grace, and I try to give that out as much as possible because of how much grace I've been given.\"", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Metro_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Metro Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrGOj08RhP0EiFZXclM-Jktq5bY=/0x578:7836x4496/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25477475/2155425575.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624188", "eventUri": "eng-9624188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 306, "textEnd": 311}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 511, "textEnd": 517}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Scheffler was handcuffed and briefly jailed after a Louisville police officer claimed the golfer failed to stop his SUV when ordered to do so. The officer claimed he was dragged and injured by Scheffler's vehicle.\n\nBut while relieved, Scheffler said Tuesday at at Muirfield Village Golf Club that having the charges dropped was \"kind of only the beginning of kind of getting past it.\"\n\nFriends and golf fans now feel freed up to ask Scheffler about the traffic incident.\n\n\"I'm hoping to get there (to normalcy), but it's almost more appropriate for people to ... make jokes about it and stuff like that,\" he said.\n\nEven if he never has to answer another question about the arrest outside the gates of Valhalla Golf Club, Scheffler said the trauma will always be only a flashback away.\n\n\"That's something that will always, I think, kind of stick with me,\" he said. \"That mug shot, I'm sure, is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nThe Memorial is Scheffler's first tournament since the charges were dropped, but he said the chaos has not negatively impacted his golf.\n\n\"When it comes to on the golf course, I'm always prepared to go out and play,\" he said. \"Even after I got arrested I went out on Friday and had a good round of golf. ... No matter what the circumstances are off the course, if I'm showing up at a tournament it's not some sort of ceremonial deal. I'm here to play.\"\n\nHis record at Muirfield is impressive.

A fatal accident claimed the life of 69-year-old tournament volunteer John Mills outside the entrance to Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky, leading to huge traffic issues in the area.\n\nWorld number one Scheffler was accused of driving around the jam and ignoring police instructions as he attempted to enter the golf course.

By the time he made it back to the course just minutes before his tee time, a mugshot of Scheffler had circulated around the world.\n\nThe 27-year-old dusted himself down and shot a stellar round of five-under-par to move into contention, only for a poor third round to see him fall away. But more importantly, Scheffler believed the charges were bogus and he would have no case to answer.\n\nThe charges were duly dropped on May 30 to Scheffler's relief, and he admitted in his press conference ahead of The Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio that he and his lawyer, Steve Romines, were prepared to take legal action against Louisville PD if the case was taken forward.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because, like I said, there was a ton of evidence in our favour,\" Scheffler said. \"There were eyewitnesses on the scene that corroborated my story and the video evidence, the police officer talking to me after.\n\n\"All the evidence pointed to exactly what my side of the story was, and so if we needed to...

Traffic had been stopped outside the course after a pedestrian was struck and killed by a shuttle bus.\n\nScheffler, 27, had been facing charges of felony second-degree assault of a police officer, third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.\n\nJefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell said Wednesday his office would not pursue the case\n\n\"Mr. Scheffler's characterization that this was a 'big misunderstanding' is corroborated by the evidence,\" he said.\n\nScheffler said it isn't easy to forget his world being thrown upside down by the arrest.\n\n\"It's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course,\" he reflected Tuesday.\n\n\"And so it's not something that I love talking about and it's something that I'm hoping to move past, but when the charges are dropped, that's kind of only the beginning of kind of getting past it, if that makes sense. So kind of operating through that now. It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always, I think, kind of stick with me. That mug shot, I'm sure is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nHe said he wants to put the case behind him and had no interest in pursuing a lawsuit against police for wrongful arrest.\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right,\" he said.\n\nScheffler didn't play last week at the RBC Canadian Open, instead learning the secrets of first-time fatherhood with baby Bennett. And he said he got some sleep, with his wife handling the middle-of-the-night parenting duties.\n\n\"Right now, I'm still trying to learn how to burp him and change his diaper and stuff like that, so as far as the true parenting, I'm trying to just be the best support I can at home,\" he said.\n\nScheffler also addressed the death of Grayson Murray, a two-time PGA Tour winner who died by suicide May 24.\n\n\"When we found out Grayson passed away last week, it was obviously a pretty big shock to all of us. It's been a tough 10 days trying to process what transpired. I think your mind always goes to I think we all wish we could have done more for him, wish we could have done things differently. Your mind just kind of goes to what you could have done to prevent this from happening,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"Grayson, he was a sweet guy, he really was. He was fun to be around, he worked hard on and off the golf course.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muirfield_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muirfield Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grayson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grayson Murray"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624188", "eventUri": "eng-9624188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1068, "textEnd": 1074}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 3252, "textEnd": 3258}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

But golf insider Dan Rapaport noted something interesting - the way he said \"Louisville.\"\n\n\"Scottie Scheffler calls the city in which he was arrested \"LEWIS-ville.\" With the hard S,\" Rapaport wrote.\n\nFor those unaware, the \"S\" is silent in Louisville and the first half of the name is pronounced \"Louie\" (think King Louis XVI of France or King Louie from The Jungle Book).\n\nOn second thought, maybe Scottie Scheffler did deserve to get arrested in Louisville if he's going to pronounce the name of the city like that... (just kidding).\n\nThe U.S. Open is next week and as usual Scheffler ranks among the favorites to win the event and claim his second major of the year.

Scheffler was charged with a felony for assaulting a police officer with his vehicle, along with three misdemeanors, after police alleged he did not follow instructions.\n\nThe arresting officer said he was dragged by Scheffler's car and suffered minor injuries.\n\nA surveillance video released by Louisville police last week showed Detective Bryan Gillis pursuing Scheffler's vehicle on foot and stopping him from entering the course. Scheffler is later pulled from the car and handcuffed. But the video did not show Gillis' first contact with Scheffler, authorities said.\n\nScheffler's mug shot from jail made its way onto shirts during the final three days of the PGA Championship. He was released in time to make his tee time for the second round and shot 66 to get into contention. He finished the week tied for eighth.\n\nHis attorney, Steve Romines, said the day charges formally were dismissed that there were grounds for a civil lawsuit against Louisville police. He said Scheffler was not interested in pursuing litigation.\n\n\"That was something that if we needed to use it, I think Steve was more than ready to use that, just because there was a ton of evidence in our favor,\" Scheffler said. \"I don't really know how to describe it, but basically if I had to show up in court, I think Steve was more than prepared to pursue legal action.\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department, and that just doesn't seem right.\"\n\nScheffler played the following week at Colonial and did not speak to the media. This was his first news conference since the charges were dismissed.\n\nHe said his only other run-in with the law has been a couple of speeding tickets.\n\n\"I think that's part of the recovery process from the whole scenario, is your brain tries to figure out how this happened, and I will probably never figure out why or how this happened,\" he said. \"But it's just one of those deals that it will always be kind of ingrained in my season this year.

In fact, his only experience of the Donald Ross gem in the Sandhills was watching a flyover on YouTube on Monday.\n\n\"I wouldn't trade those weeks that I had last year just because I felt like I learned a lot about myself and what makes me tick and I think it made me a better player today,\" Scheffler said of his struggles on the greens at Colonial and Memorial last year. \"A lot of the challenges in this game, I think, can only toughen me up, and I feel like at this point in my career, I'm in a great head space mentally. I'm excited about where my game's at, and I'm ready to go out and compete this week and for the rest of the season.\"\n\nWith 10 consecutive top-10 results, including victories at the Masters and three other tournaments, the next two months include two majors and the Olympics. Wins in those events could elevate Scheffler's stature in the game to a level not seen since Tiger Woods regularly roamed the fairways of the PGA Tour.\n\nWith a putting stroke that now seems to hold up under pressure and a swing that has never wavered, the next two months could be one of the best in the modern era -- if Scheffler can stay out of his own way\n\n\"I think I learned a lot about how I need to manage myself week to week, manage expectations and results,\" Scheffler added about last year's struggles on the greens. \"I felt like I learned a lot about myself and what I could do to compete better.\"\n\nRelated: Adam Scott Shoots 64 at U.S. Open Qualifying in Ohio\n\nRelated: Zac Blair Wins U.S. Open Final Qualifying Event for Trip to Pinehurst\n\nRelated: Scottie Scheffler's

What?\" after learning Scottie Scheffler had been arrested outside of Valhalla Golf Club prior to the second round of the PGA Championship after allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while trying to make his way into the venue.\n\nThe top-ranked golfer on the planet was booked and posed for a mugshot before making it back to the course for his scheduled tee time and ultimately finished in a tie for eighth, which is pretty impressive when you consider the circumstances surrounding his time at the major tournament.\n\nBased on the eyewitness accounts of the incident in question (and the lack of body camera footage captured by the Louisville Metro Police Department detective at the center of it), it was widely believed the four charges that were filed against Scheffler would be dropped before the case went to court.\n\nThat ended up being the case, as prosecutors ultimately declined to pursue them after Scheffler agreed not to pursue any civil retribution stemming from the matter.\n\nThis week, Scheffler will attempt to win his fifth tournament of the ongoing PGA Tour season when the Memorial Tournament kicks off at Muirfield Village Golf Club outside of Columbus, Ohio, and on Tuesday, he got the chance to address the lingering fallout of the arrest during a press conference that was held prior to the start of an event that will kick off on Thursday.\n\nScheffler shed some light on the series of events that led to the charges being dropped before discussing how the arrest impacted him, saying:\n\n\"I would say that I still haven't 100% moved past it because, yeah, the charges are dropped, but now, it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it and ask me about the situation.\n\nTo be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving just because it was fairly traumatic for me; being arrested going into the golf course.\n\nIt's not something that I love talking about.

Scottie Scheffler is always, completely, Scottie Scheffler. It is the key to his steady excellence, the explanation for how he has handled success so well, the reason his recent arrest seemed so obviously not his fault, and why he was asked, Tuesday morning, to speak about a dead friend.\n\nTen days ago, Grayson Murray said he wasn't feeling well, withdrew from the PGA Tour event in Fort Worth, went home to Florida, and took his own life. Murray's family did not attend the memorial service for him at Muirfield Village. But they did suggest potential eulogists. Along with Murray's caddie, Jay Green, and Webb Simpson, who has a long history with Murray, they mentioned Scheffler.\n\nScheffler was not the closest to Murray. But he was the closest to what Murray wanted to be. He blends faith, family, human decency and competitive fire so well that asking which comes first misses the point. None of those things come second.\n\n\"We're not designed to live this life on our own,\" Scheffler told the gathering near the first tee, which included almost everybody in the Memorial Tournament field. \"We all carry a lot more baggage than we let on -- myself especially.\"\n\nWhen a person commits suicide, there are layers to the heartbreak. One of them, Scheffler said after the service, is that, \"I think we all wish we could have done more for him, wish we could have done things differently. You know, your mind just kind of goes to what you could have done to prevent this from happening.\"\n\nMurray talked about his struggles with depression, anxiety and alcohol abuse. So there were signs he might do what he ultimately did, but they were still hard to read at the time. Murray said he had stopped drinking. He won a Tour event for the first time in seven years. He said he had learned from his hotheaded earlier days: \"I was young and thought I was invincible.\" He had gotten engaged (to Christiana Ritchie). In retrospect, Murray was still searching, and it is not surprising that the search led him to Scheffler.\n\n\"It was really fun getting to know him the last few months as he was trying to ..., you know, marriage was around the corner for him,\" Scheffler said. \"He had his fiancee, and he was trying to get his fiancee involved in life out here. He was trying to really be the best version of himself, and to be a great husband. He was looking forward to one day becoming a dad, and it pains me that he's no longer with us.\"\n\nTwice during his eulogy, Scheffler said Murray was \"sweet.\" That was not the first word that came to mind in Murray's younger days. The fact that Scheffler saw him that way says something about the work that Murray put into himself. But it also says something about Scheffler.\n\nIn the past month, Scheffler has shown extraordinary empathy. After his bizarre and unfounded arrest before the second round of the PGA Championship, Scheffler continually called it a \"misunderstanding,\" never lashed out at the cop who arrested him, and repeatedly tried to turn attention to the worker, John Mills, who was struck and killed by a car that morning.\n\nScheffler was asked Tuesday if he will react differently when he hears or reads that somebody was arrested. His answer, basically, was that his arrest taught him a lesson he didn't need to learn.\n\n\"I try not to see people for, kind of, their bad sides,\" Scheffler said. \"You know, just because somebody is accused of something doesn't mean that they actually did it. Or maybe they did do it, and maybe they just made a mistake. I think forgiveness is something that's lost in our society. Just because somebody made a mistake at one point in their life doesn't mean that they're a bad person.\n\n\"I think sometimes in society people are expecting perfection out of everybody and just because somebody will make one mistake, people will crucify them for that, and I never really believed in that. I believe in forgiveness. I believe in grace.\"\n\nScheffler believed in Grayson Murray. He believed in who he was and who he was becoming. He believed Murray deserved the embrace he craved. At the end of his unscripted eulogy for his 30-year-old friend, Scottie Scheffler said, \"Love you, buddy,\" then walked back to where he had stood, leaned on his wife, Meredith, and cried.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muirfield_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muirfield Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grayson Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major depressive disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Research", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Research", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Online_Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Online Memorials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1569,h_882,x_825,y_66/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01hzj0ya1bm1edeb36ht.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624188", "eventUri": "eng-9624188", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Beforehand, he spoke to the media about the news that he was no longer facing the prospect of a trial after he was arrested attempting to enter Valhalla for his second round.\n\nScheffler admitted he first got an inkling the charges would be dropped on his way to a T2 at the Charles Schwab Challenge the following week.\n\n\"I had a good idea at the end of the week at Colonial that they were going to be dropped,\" he explained. \"Obviously, we had a lot of evidence on our side. We needed to let the legal process play out at that point.\n\n\"Towards the end of the week at Colonial, I think my lawyer used the term, like, it went from, like, a 1-foot putt to it's on the lip, kind of thing, and then nothing is obviously official until it becomes really official, but I think Friday afternoon it was pretty official in our mind.\"\n\nWhile Scheffler showed signs of his best form at the Colonial Country Club tournament, after his third round of the PGA Championship, when he shot an uncharacteristic 73, he admitted the events of the day before had taken their toll. That's something he revealed he couldn't begin to overcome until confirmation came that he was in the clear.\n\n\"I definitely hadn't moved past it,\" he said. \"I would say that I still, you know, wouldn't have 100% moved past it because, yeah, the charges are dropped, but I still - now it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it and ask me about the situation and, to be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course.\"\n\nRegardless, he said there had been relief when the news broke - even if it was unlikely he'd be able to completely put it behind him. He added: \"It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always, I think, kind of stick with me. That mug shot, I'm sure is not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nDespite the lingering possibility that he would need to stand trial, Scheffler explained that he remained focused on playing - even if his form took a slight dip.\n\n\"On the golf course, I showed up at Colonial ready to play,\" he said. \"I didn't just show up to go whack the ball around. I played and I wanted to compete and I wanted to win the tournament and that's why I'm here this week.\n\n\"So when it comes to on the golf course stuff, I'm always prepared to go out and play. I was prepared to go play in Louisville, even after I got arrested. I went out on Friday and had a good round golf. Saturday wasn't my best stuff, but came back again on Sunday.\n\n\"And so on the course, I'm always ready to play. No matter what the circumstances are off the course, if I'm showing up at a tournament, it's not some sort of ceremonial deal. I'm here to play.\"\n\nGiven that, and the fact he can now play free of off-course concerns, his opponents over the coming weeks could be worried, particularly with the US Open around the corner. Scheffler, who won The Masters in April, also admitted that the next Major is never far from his mind.\n\nHe said: \"I'm always preparing for the next week and I'm trying to manage my practice to where I'm trying to get a little bit better each day, and I think the Majors are always kind of earmarked in my head on the calendar. I try to block 'em out, but the Majors are always in the back of my head.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_hall@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Mike Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Invitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonial National Invitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muirfield_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muirfield Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Country_Club_(Fort_Worth)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonial Country Club (Fort Worth)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLnftzKir5dYSTz6mZdayS-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624188", "eventUri": "eng-9624188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Championship arrest | Meath Chronicle", "body": "Scottie Scheffler 'hoping to move past' US PGA Championship arrest RSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 4 Jun 2024, 6:51 PM Last updated: Tue 4 Jun 2024, 7:13 PM\n\nBy Phil Casey, PA Golf Correspondent\n\nScottie Scheffler admitted he had yet to fully put his arrest during the US PGA Championship behind him, despite all charges being dropped.\n\nScheffler was detained ahead of his second round last month after he tried to drive into the course in heavy traffic which had been caused by an unrelated accident in which a male pedestrian died.\n\nThe world number one was released in time to return to Valhalla and card a remarkable 66, but only after being charged with four offences, the most serious being second-degree assault of a police officer, which is a felony.\n\nThe charges were dropped 12 days later, with Scheffler finding out during the preceding week's Charles Schwab Challenge - where he finished tied second - that was set to be the case.\n\n\"I would say that I still wouldn't have 100 per cent moved past it,\" Scheffler said ahead of the Memorial Tournament.\n\n\"Because now it's almost more appropriate for people to ask me about it the situation and, to be honest with you, it's not something that I love reliving, just because it was fairly traumatic for me being arrested going into the golf course.\n\n\"It's not something that I love talking about and it's something that I'm hoping to move past, but when the charges are dropped, that's kind of only the beginning of getting past it, if that makes sense.\n\n\"It was definitely a bit of a relief, but not total relief because that's something that will always, I think, kind of stick with me.\n\n\"That mugshot I'm sure is not going anywhere any time soon.\"\n\nScheffler confirmed the assertion of his attorney, Steve Romines, that he had decided not to sue the Louisville Metro Police Department because it would be the city's taxpayers who would ultimately \"pay for whatever occurred\".\n\n\"I did not want to have to pursue legal action against Louisville because, at the end of the day, the people of Louisville are then going to have to pay for the mistakes of their police department and that just doesn't seem right,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"So at no point did I ever want to sue them, but if it came there, I think my lawyer was more than prepared to use that as more of like a bargaining chip-type thing more than anything.\n\n\"I think sometimes in society people are expecting perfection out of everybody and just because somebody will make one mistake, people will crucify them for that and I've never really believed in that.\n\n\"I believe in forgiveness, I believe in grace and I try to give that out as much as possible because of how much grace I've been given.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 4 Jun 2024, 6:51 PM Last updated: Tue 4 Jun 2024, 7:13 PM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie",

{"id": 223742548, "title": "Sir Ed Davey says Lib Dems interest \u2018best for a generation\u2019 at campaign launch", "text": "Sir Ed Davey has said the Liberal Democrats are getting their best response from voters \u201cfor a generation\u201d as he launched the party\u2019s General Election campaign. The party leader also criticised Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and other Conservative MPs for taking their constituents \u201cfor granted\u201d as he spoke confidently about winning more seats on July 4. Sir Ed unveiled the Lib Dems\u2019 new battlebus, named Yellow Hammer 1, and met a large crowd of party supporters at the launch in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire on Sunday. He focused largely on health and the environment in a speech to the supporters, including hospitals \u201cwith dangerous crumbling roofs\u201d and \u201csewage pouring into\u201d wards, and promised to introduce a 10-year rolling repair programme for the NHS estate. Asked what the Lib Dems\u2019 targets were in the election, Sir Ed told the PA news agency: \u201cI\u2019m not putting a ceiling on our ambitions. \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is talking to voters with my teams across the country, and the Liberal Democrats are getting a great response \u2013 a better response than we\u2019ve had for a generation. \u201cI was elected back in 1997 and this feels to me quite a bit like that. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about the other parties, I\u2019m just excited about our job and excited about change.\u201d The Lib Dems are targeting traditionally Conservative heartlands in the so-called blue wall in southern England. Buoyed by a series of by-election and local election victories within the so-called blue wall, the party is eyeing the constituencies of several Cabinet ministers including Mr Hunt. Asked about Mr Hunt\u2019s Godalming and Ash constituency, Sir Ed said he was \u201clooking forward to that campaign\u201d because the party had heard from many lifelong Tory voters. He added: \u201cI feel people like Jeremy Hunt have let them down, taken them for granted, assumed they\u2019ll always vote Conservative.\u201d The Tories and Labour both made eye-catching pledges over the weekend, with the former promising mandatory national service if re-elected and the latter keen to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote. Asked about both policies, Sir Ed said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats have long supported votes from 16 and I\u2019m glad other parties are now catching up with us. \u201cAll I\u2019d say is as political reforms go, it\u2019s an important one but it\u2019s quite small. \u201cWe need to transform our politics. \u201cAs for this distraction of a policy by the Conservatives on national service, the hypocrisy is just breathtaking. \u201cWhat we need is full-time, professional, highly trained troops. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the best army in the world and we should be backing it.\u201d", "summary": "Sir Ed unveiled the Lib Dems\u2019 new battlebus, named Yellow Hammer 1, and met a large crowd of party supporters at the launch on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-hunt-lib-dems-mps-conservative-cambridgeshire-b1160328.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/26/16/a77fe48588627896010c7ad4c8c78775Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE2ODIxNzgz-2.76337195.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:35:07", "author": "Harry Stedman", "authors": ["Harry Stedman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.047}

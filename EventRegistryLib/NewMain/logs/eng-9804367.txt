May he RIP and his family, friends, and fans find comfort in how much he was loved,\" Rose wrote.\n\nSullivan's passing follows a difficult period for his family, who had revealed in early July that the wrestling icon was in grave danger after a devastating accident in May 2024. The accident occurred during an autograph signing in Florida, leading to emergency surgery that saved his leg and life. However, Sullivan faced severe complications, including sepsis and encephalitis, which placed an immense financial burden on his family as he remained in and out of consciousness in the ICU.\n\nDespite the challenges, Sullivan showed incredible resilience, with friends, colleagues, and fans rallying around him. A GoFundMe campaign set up by his daughter, Nicole, quickly exceeded its goal, demonstrating the outpouring of support for the wrestling legend.\n\nIn his final days, Sullivan received an outpouring of love from the wrestling community, with numerous \"Thank you Kevin\" and \"Get well Kevin\" messages and videos being shared for him to see. Wrestling legend Ric Flair was among those who paid tribute, writing on X, \"Kevin Sullivan has been one of my closest friends in the business. His knowledge of all sports, not just wrestling, is unparalleled. He is one of the most brilliant minds in the history of our business... Stay strong Kevin!!!! We need you.\"\n\nBorn Kevin Francis Sullivan on October 26, 1949, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Sullivan faced adversity early in life when he was struck with rheumatic fever at age eight, leaving him bedridden for a year. He began working out with a set of weights he found in his basement, sparking a lifelong passion for physical fitness and wrestling.\n\nSullivan's wrestling career began in the Northeast and Quebec before he moved to Florida in 1972, where he learned under the legendary promoter Eddie Graham. Known for his intense and believable in-ring persona, Sullivan overcame his relatively small stature by wrestling at around 250 pounds and using his intensity to make up for any size disadvantage.\n\nThroughout his career, Sullivan became known as a masterful booker and storyteller. His time as the \"Prince of Darkness\" in Championship Wrestling from Florida cemented his status as a wrestling icon. His devilish persona was so convincing that in 1992, erroneous reports of his death led to a bizarre situation where Sullivan had to assure friends and colleagues that he was, in fact, still alive.\n\nSullivan's influence extended far beyond the ring, with many wrestlers and promoters seeking his advice and guidance. He was recognized for his contributions to the wrestling world with numerous awards, including the Men's Wrestling Award from the Cauliflower Alley Club in 2022 and inductions into the NWA Hall of Fame (2014) and the New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame (2013).\n\nSullivan leaves behind a legacy as one of wrestling's most respected minds. He had four children from three marriages. His most publicized marriage was to Nancy Toffoloni, who later left Sullivan for Chris Benoit. Tragically, she and their son Daniel were killed by Benoit in 2007, a case that led to Sullivan being wrongly implicated by some fans.\n\nKevin Sullivan's contributions to wrestling, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes, will be remembered by fans and colleagues alike.

Sullivan had been battling serious medical issues since May with his loved ones asking for help through GoFundMe in July. Sullivan's influence on the wrestling business will remain for years to come having left his mark on so many who still wrestle today.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of being a wrestling fan is dealing with the heroes you watched and grew up with eventually passing away, and today, another star fans of a certain age will remember very fondly has passed on. Kevin Sullivan, best known for his work in WCW as both a booker and an in-ring performer, has passed away following a recent battle with some serious health issues, aged 74.\n\nThe Taskmaster Passed Away\n\nThe news that Sullivan had lost his battle was shared by his close friend Barry Rose on Friday morning (via Fightful). It was only a month ago that the call was put out to fans asking for help as it was revealed Sullivan was dealing with a \"critical medical emergency\". The issues began while Sullivan was at a signing in May, shortly after which he underwent surgery to save his leg and his life. Despite the surgery, his life was still at risk, and now three months later, the wrestling legend is no longer with us.\n\nRelated\n\nKevin Sullivan's Satanist Gimmick Is One Of The Most Daring In Wrestling History\n\nKevin Sullivan embraced a dark gimmick that capitalized on the zeitgeist of his time and set up how fans perceived him for decades to come.\n\nThe GoFundMe set up for Sullivan raised more than $50,000 and includes donations from Chris Jericho and Cody Rhodes. Not only evidence of how much Sullivan still means to performers competing today, but how big of an influence he had on the industry and will continue to have even though he's no longer around. The tributes for Sullivan will be pouring in as I type this, and if you're a younger fan unfamiliar with his work, you're about to find out just how important he has been to wrestling via messages, tributes, and stories shared on social media.\n\nKevin Sullivan's Influence On The Industry\n\nDespite wrestling just about everywhere throughout the 1970s and '80s, the stretch of Sullivan's career fans will likely remember most is in the mid to late '90s when he returned to WCW. Sullivan wrestled some of his time during that period in his career under the name The Taskmaster, a gimmick he became so synonymous with that he used it to name his podcast decades later. Midway through that WCW run is when Sullivan made the transition from wrestler to booker, a period during which he arguably had the biggest influence on the business, shaping the in-ring product when WCW was at its peak, and leaving a mark on careers that remain to this day.\n\nSullivan continued to work in the wrestling business after he was fired from WCW right before it was bought out by WWE in 2001. On the independent circuit as well as work in TNA and ROH, and then at conventions and signings for the final few years of his life. Our hearts go out to Sullivan's partner, who he has been with for almost 30 years, and the rest of his family and friends at this time.", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSportster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_coulson@thesportster.com", "name": "Josh Coulson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sullivan_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimmick_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gimmick (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jericho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Jericho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impact Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mixcollage-09-aug-2024-01-29-pm-9521.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804367", "eventUri": "eng-9804367", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

In light of his passing, Triple H has now reacted to the same.\n\nSullivan's passing follows a challenging period for his family. In early July, they revealed that the wrestling icon had been in critical condition following a severe accident during a May 2024 autograph signing in Florida. The accident led to emergency surgery that saved his leg and life, but Sullivan faced severe complications, including sepsis and encephalitis, placing a heavy financial strain on his family as he struggled in the ICU.\n\nThroughout these trials, Sullivan demonstrated remarkable resilience, and the support from friends, colleagues, and fans was overwhelming. A GoFundMe campaign organized by his daughter, Nicole, quickly surpassed its goal, reflecting the widespread admiration and support for the wrestling legend. Ultimately he passed away but fans continued to pour in support for him until the last day.\n\nTriple H took to Twitter and praised Kevin Sullivan for having one of the most unique minds in the history of professional wrestling. He acknowledged Sullivan's ability to push creative boundaries and develop some of the most intriguing characters in the industry. Triple H also highlighted Sullivan's unwavering passion for wrestling and extended his thoughts to Sullivan's family, friends, and fans.\n\n\"Kevin Sullivan had one of the most unique minds in the history of our industry, pushing creative boundaries and developing some of the most intriguing characters to step into the ring. He had an unwavering passion for what we do. My thoughts are with his family, friends & fans\"\n\nA distinctive and influential figure in sports-entertainment, Sullivan achieved remarkable success both in the ring and behind the scenes with his innovative and boundary-pushing ideas.\n\nAs a villain, Sullivan was a formidable adversary to some of wrestling's greatest heroes, including Dusty Rhodes, Hulk Hogan, and The Road Warriors. He was known for leading menacing factions such as the Army of Darkness, the collegiate bullies of The Varsity Club, and the chaotic Dungeon of Doom, which famously introduced Big Show to the wrestling world.

During this time, Sullivan memorably feuded with the territory's top babyface, Dusty Rhodes.\n\nHeading to Jim Crockett Promotions, the federation that would eventually become WCW, in 1987, Sullivan joined the Varsity Club, a group made of Rick Steiner and Mike Rotunda that drew on their shoot wresting backgrounds. He would later form an alliance with Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) and Bam Bam Bigelow. He would leave the promotion in 1991.\n\nAfter two years in the fledgling Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion where he won the ECW World Tag Team Championships with the Tazmaniac (Taz), Sullivan returned to WCW in 1994. He began teaming with the Equalizer, who had been repackaged as Sullivan's kayfabe brother, Dave Sullivan, an avid Hulk Hogan fan. Hating Hogan, Sullivan brought in Ed Leslie and Avalanche (John Tenta), the former Earthquake in the World Wrestling Federation, to feud with Hogan as the \"Three Faces of Fear.\"\n\nBy 1995, Sullivan reverted to a dark gimmick as \"The Taskmaster\" and led the Dungeon of Doom stable that featured the likes of Paul \"The Giant\" Wight, Konnan, Meng and the Barbarian.\n\nIn 1996, Sullivan began a feud with Chris Benoit that saw the valet Woman, his real-life wife Nancy Sullivan, begin a kayfabe relationship with Benoit. The on-screen relationship turned into a real one and Sullivan and Nancy divorced the following year with Nancy and Benoit marrying in 2000. Benoit would go on to murder his wife and son, Daniel, and then die by suicide in 2007.\n\nAfter losing a retirement match to Benoit at Bash at the Beach 1997, Sullivan exited as a TV character outside of sporadic appearances to focus on his duties as part of the booking committee. Upon the firing of Vince Russo in 2000, Sullivan assumed the role of head booker. The move riled a number of talents within the company with Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn granted their releases to jump to the WWF. Sullivan's tenure as booker would not last long and neither did WCW, sold to Vince McMahon in March of 2001.\n\nIn the years after leaving WCW, Sullivan would make appearances at conventions and occasional appearances for independent promotions including a brief run in Ring of Honor in 2016 and 2017 where he was aligned with Punishment Martinez, who would go on to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion Damian Priest.\n\nWord of Sullivan's passing elicited tributes from across the industry.\n\n\"Kevin Sullivan had one of the most unique minds in the history of our industry, pushing creative boundaries and developing some of the most intriguing characters to step into the ring,\" WWE chief operating officer and head booker Paul Levesque wrote. \"He had an unwavering passion for what we do. My thoughts are with his family, friends and fans.\"\n\n\"I'm deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my friend, Kevin Sullivan,\" Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts wrote. \"What an incredible mind for the business and an even greater person.

PWInsider.com later confirmed the news.\n\nSullivan had been dealing with health issues in recent months. His health declined at a rapid rate this past May when he underwent emergency surgery that saved his leg and life.\n\nHe later dealt with severe complications, including sepsis and encephalitis. A GoFundMe page was set up for Sullivan to raise $20,000 to help with his medical bills.\n\nSullivan entered the business in 1982 and worked for various promotions, including Florida Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, WCW, and ROH. He held countless championships throughout his career as a wrestler and booker.\n\nSullivan was a top draw and remembered for his feuds with top acts including Hulk Hogan, Dusty Rhodes, The Road Warriors, Sting, Randy Savage, Four Horsemen, Terry Funk, and so many more. After losing a retirement match to Chris Benoit in 1997, he started working behind the scenes in WCW while wrestling on a part-time basis. He has been praised for having one of the greatest wrestling minds in the history of the business.\n\nWe send our condolences to the Sullivan family at this time.", "source": {"uri": "wrestlingnews.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wrestling News | WWE and AEW Results, Spoilers, Rumors & Scoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_ravens@wrestlingnews.co", "name": "Andrew Ravens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sullivan_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crockett_Promotions", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Crockett Promotions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sepsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sting (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Funk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry Funk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Benoit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Horsemen_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Road Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s46341.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kevin-Sullivan.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804367", "eventUri": "eng-9804367", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Sullivan had been battling health issues in recent months, and his struggles physically began at an autograph signing in May, as he suffered a \"devastating accident\" that resulted in emergency surgery. Sullivan struggled to function independently after the incident. This sparked a GoFundMe page being set up for Sullivan in July. The GoFundMe raised funds to assist Sullivan with his medical costs. Sullivan's passing was confirmed from Florida wrestling personality Barry Rose in a statement.\n\n\"With the heaviest of hearts, we are devastated to have to report the passing of the legendary Kevin Sullivan,\" Rose wrote. \"May he RIP and his family, friends and fans find comfort in how much he was loved.\"\n\nSullivan began wrestling in 1970, utilizing an amateur style in the Boston area. He eventually made his way to Championship Wrestling from Florida and Jim Crockett Promotions in the 1980s. There, Sullivan began to make his name, forming a stable called The Varsity Club alongside WWE Hall of Famers Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner. The Varsity Club feuded with wrestling legends like Dusty Rhodes and The Road Warriors.\n\nSullivan next took his talents to ECW where he began to tap into his hardcore side. He wrestled in bunkhouse and steel cage matches and worked alongside notable ECW names like Taz, Terry Funk, and Shane Douglas. He is a two-time ECW Tag Team Champion with Taz.\n\nAfter ECW, Sullivan returned to World Championship Wrestling for an extended run that ultimately ran up until his retirement. His most recent involvement in the pro wrestling world came in June 2016 at Ring of Honor, as he made a surprise appearance during an unsanctioned match between Steve Corino and BJ Whitmer. Sullivan then formed an alliance with Whitmer and Punishment Martinez, better known today as WWE's Damian Priest. Three years later, Sullivan wrestled Brian Pillman Jr. (WWE's Lexis King) in a no holds barred match at 69 years old in what would be his final match.\n\n\"Kevin Sullivan had one of the most unique minds in the history of our industry, pushing creative boundaries and developing some of the most intriguing characters to step into the ring,\" WWE Chief Content Officer Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque wrote on social media. \"He had an unwavering passion for what we do.

He was 74 years old.\n\nHe had suffered from health problems in recent months due to a \"devastating accident\" that took place in May 2024 while he was in Florida for an autograph signing. According to a GoFundMe launched at the time, Sullivan had emergency surgery that ultimately saved his leg and life. However, he was facing many serious complications, including sepsis and encephalitis. Because of this, Sullivan spent time in and out of consciousness in the ICU.\n\nSullivan was known for his work as an in-ring performer and as the booker of WCW. He got his start in the Northeast, but he became more widely known for his \"Prince of Darkness\" gimmick in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Later, he caught on with Jim Crockett Promotions/WCW as a member of the Varsity Club with Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner.\n\nSullivan returned to WCW in 1994, which led to his tenure as the leader of the Dungeon of Doom. The stable, led by Sullivan, had an ongoing feud against Hulk Hogan. Sullivan employed many wacky characters like Zodiac and Avalanche, and The Giant (Paul Wight) and Meng (Haku) in an effort to end Hulkamania.\n\nAfter losing a retirement match in 1997, Sullivan focused more on his booking duties, which he held until WWE shuttered WCW. Later, Sullivan made sporadic independent appearances, as well as a brief run in Ring Of Honor beginning in 2016. In recent years, Sullivan hosted a weekly podcast, 'Tuesday with the Taskmaster'.\n\nWrestleZone sends its condolences to the family and friends of Kevin Sullivan.\n\nWrestleZone spoke with Kevin Sullivan last year about the concept of the Dungeon Of Doom stable in WCW. Sullivan said people hated the idea at first, but appreciates how time has been kind to the group and its legacy.\n\n\"Hulk had his friends, and he wanted them to be used on TV. So I decided that I was booking them [and] rather than putting them in singles because their style was completely different to what was happening than in wrestling. I thought about putting them all together in one segment. It helps him because I wanted him to turn heel after six months when he got there. I wanted to gain his trust. He was used to somebody -- I kind of filled the void of Bobby Heenan ending Hulkamania and me saying he's not who you think he is. So, lump us all together, it gave a little bit of comedy to the show.\"\n\nHe also said He-Man and Masters of the Universe was probably a subconscious influence.\n\n\"Now that they've grown up, [fans] love it. Masters of the Universe, yeah, I did it probably subconsciously because I used to watch the cartoon. I thought, yeah, [Hulk] was so over the top, say prayers, take your vitamins, that I had to go the other way. And I'm sure some of that rubbed off on me. And I mean, actually, you're watching all this great wrestling from the luchadores to the cruiserweights to the nWo to the Four Horsemen. It gave a little bit of levity to the show.\"", "source": {"uri": "wrestlezone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wrestlezone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_pritchard@wrestlezone.com", "name": "Bill

He had an unwavering passion for what we do. My thoughts are with his family, friends & fans.\"\n\nKevin Sullivan was known for his impactful and often controversial career, which spanned several decades from the 1970s to the late 1990s. He began his wrestling journey in the early 1970s in the National Wrestling Alliance, developing a reputation for his intense and unorthodox style. Sullivan gained significant recognition during his time in Championship Wrestling from Florida, where he adopted a dark character and formed The Army of Darkness stable. This persona was one of the earliest examples of a gothic character in wrestling, showcasing Sullivan's groundbreaking approach. Known for psychological tactics and shocking angles, his work in Florida established him as a top heel and set the stage for future storylines that blurred the lines between reality and fiction.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Sullivan's career continued to thrive in various promotions, most notably in WCW. As part of WCW, Sullivan was both an in-ring performer and a key member of the booking team. He was instrumental in creating memorable storylines, including his work with the Dungeon of Doom, a faction aimed at challenging Hulk Hogan during his WCW run. Despite his character's often dark and controversial nature, Sullivan's influence on wrestling is undeniable, as he paved the way for more complex and character-driven narratives.\n\nOur thoughts are with Kevin Sullivan's family, friends, and fans at this time. Losing someone close is never easy, especially a legend like Sullivan. Though he may be gone, the impact he left on the wrestling world will not fade anytime soon.\n\nWhat is your favorite moment from Kevin Sullivan's career?

A GoFundMe page for his medical expenses successfully reached its goal thanks to an outpouring of support from the wrestling community -- including prominent names like Cody Rhodes and Chris Jericho.\n\nHailing from Boston, Sullivan started wrestling in the Northeast United States and Canada before heading south to work NWA territories as \"Johnny West\" in the early 1970s. He had a stint with the WWWF (now WWE) in the mid-70s, worked Memphis with Jerry Lawler in 1981, and rose to fame with his \"Prince of Darkness\" gimmick in Championship Wrestling from Florida in the 80s.\n\nThe Satanic Panic-inspired character led an Army of Darkness that included Luna Vachon, and feuded with the likes of Dusty Rhodes & Barry Windham in CWF and Superstar Billy Graham, Blackjack Mulligan & others in the Boston-based International Championship Wrestling. Sullivan first worked for Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling in 1987, leading stables like Varsity Club and Sullivan's Slaughterhouse with future Hall of Famers like Mick Foley (as Cactus Jack), Rick Steiner & Mike Rotunda.\n\nAfter spending time in Smoky Mountain Wrestling and ECW, Sullivan returned to WCW in 1994 for a run that included his famous feuds with Hulk Hogan and other stars like Randy Savage & Sting as Three Faces of Fear (with John \"Avalanche\" Tenta and Ed \"The Butcher\" Leslie) and with Hogan and The Four Horseman as the Dungeon of Doom-leading Taskmaster.\n\nHe'd begun taking on booking responsibilities for WCW by 1997, and booked his own retirement feud with Chris Benoit -- which involved Woman, played by Sullivan's then-wife and, tragically, Benoit's future wife Nancy -- so he could focus on those duties. He remained a part of the company's booking committee until taking over as head booker in 2000. That move led to Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn's immediately jumping to the then-WWF. Sullivan was fired before the sale of WCW in 2001.\n\nSullivan remained around the business in the 21st century, working occasional angles in TNA, Ring of Honor, and independent promotions along with appearances and interviews. He'd been honored by the Cauliflower Alley Club, and is a member of the NWA Hall of Fame. Sullivan's survived by his third wife Linda Taylor, with whom he had two of his four children (the other two were with his first wife, prior to his marriage to Nancy Benoit).\n\nOur thoughts are with all those who are missing Kevin Sullivan today. May he rest in peace.", "source": {"uri": "cagesideseats.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cageside Seats"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_rueter@cagesideseats.com", "name": "Sean Rueter", "type":

Sullivan had been battling a number of health issues in recent months, prompting his daughter, Nicole, to launch a GoFundMe campaign in an effort to raise funds for medical expenses. In the wake of his death, many of Sullivan's former colleagues and industry peers have now chimed in on social media to share their condolences and memories of him.\n\nRic Flair, a former opponent of Sullivan, also considered \"The Taskmaster\" to be one of his closest friends in the professional wrestling business. Less than 24 hours before his passing, Flair hailed Sullivan as \"one of the most brilliant minds\" in the entire industry, citing Sullivan as a driving force behind WCW's 83-week success against WWE during the Monday Night Wars in the late 1990s. Upon learning of Sullivan's death, Flair wrote on X, \"I am so saddened to hear about Kevin Sullivan's passing. Rest In Peace Kevin! You were an all time great athlete & friend.\"\n\nIn another X post, former WCW World Heavyweight Champion Diamond Dallas Page recalled a recent conversation he had with Sullivan after being informed of his declining health by Flair. \"This one hit me really hard,\" DDP wrote. \"Sully was a huge part of my life. Yes, we had our ups and the downs, but like so many of our brothers over the years we really grew to love each other. I'm so glad I got to talk to him before he left this planet. Thanks, @RicFlairNatrBoy.\"\n\nEric Bischoff, former President of WCW, worked closely with Sullivan in the promotion's final years. Beyond that, the two had also seemingly bonded over the art of fishing. \"Woke up to the news of Kevin Sullivans passing. This one hits hard,\" Bischoff wrote on X. \"Last time we spoke, we talked about taking a fishing trip. Kevin loved the water. Kevin was talented, loyal, and had instincts that made him a valuable partner.

He was known for his \"Prince of Darkness\" persona, taking a nod from the \"Satanic Panic\" of the era to create an occultist character who would summon dark spirits during matches. Sullivan wrestled many other high-profile athletes, notably Chris Benoit, Bruiser Brody, the Road Warriors, and Dusty Rhodes.\n\nSullivan was also known for his work behind the scenes as part of the WCW creative team in the '90s and 2000s, also playing booker and recruiting new talent.\n\nMany wrestling greats took to social media to share memories of Sullivan, including Triple H, Diamond Dallas Page, Ric Flair, and Jake the Snake.\n\nTriple H, Famed wrestler as well as Chief Content Officer of the WWE, shared some thoughts about Sullivan's creative vision.\n\nFlair had some words to share too, showing off his \"flair\" for capitalizing ever word in a sentence (which, really, fits the man's personality perfectly).\n\nDiamond Dallas Page, known to many fans as DDP, also joined the conversation. Page is famously known for rehabbing many wrestlers struggling in their later years with the help of his DDP fitness program.\n\nWhen great wrestlers leave this mortal coil, many fans turn to the best way to soothe their hearts they know: reliving the matches and moments that made them love the athlete in the first place. Here are a few of the matches that made Sullivan a household name.\n\nSullivan was not only known for wrestling the controversial Benoit, but also for a yearlong feud that started as a storyline and, some believe, found its way into reality. Sullivan was married to wrestling manager model Nancy Toffoloni, who left him in 1997 and married Benoit in 2000 after Sullivan wrote a romantic storyline involving Benoit and Toffoloni.\n\nIn a theatrical setting inside a cave lit by dancing torches, Sullivan (as The Taskmaster) gets into a heated conversation with Hulk Hogan and The Giant. While not an actual match, it is amusing to see the two face to face in a scene (not to mention seeing Hogan strangled on the floor).\n\nIn a 1976 match held in Madison Square Garden, Bruiser Brody comes out triumphant in the end -- but it's worth watching to see Sullivan put up a good fight.\n\nRhodes and Sullivan also enjoyed a feud during the WCW days in Miami in the '80s, during which his occultist persona first comes out. The feud was long and complex enough to merit entire Reddit threads and explainer videos to keep track.", "source": {"uri": "playboy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Playboy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colette_bennett@playboy.com", "name": "Colette Bennett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sullivan_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Dallas_Page", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diamond Dallas Page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Benoit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Wrestling_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Wrestling Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Road Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruiser_Brody", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bruiser Brody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Benoit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Benoit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Show", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.playboy.com/storage/2024/08/featurewrestling-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804367", "eventUri": "eng-9804367", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

He could always make you laugh, No matter what the conversation was,\" his son Daniel Sullivan III said. \"Everyone would gravitate towards him, even right up to the end.\"\n\nWhen he became club director, Sullivan was in charge of organizing events and took pride in bringing the community together.\n\n\"We had weekly swim meets through the summer, a field day around Labor Day,\" Sullivan III said. \"There were kite flying contests, pie eating and sandcastle building contests. He took pride in it alongside his father, who was a big part of it as well. Bay Way was a different world, its own little community -- and my dad made it that way.\"\n\nSullivan enjoyed playing tennis, maintaining the courts and providing lessons for club members. The Sullivans created one of the first tennis bubbles in 1965, which allowed for year-round play.\n\n\"Everyone loved him,\" said Maureen Haag, whose family belonged to the Bay Way Beach and Cabana Club. \"He was a great personality, and everyone saw that on display, so we all loved him.\"\n\nSullivan was born Sept. 1, 1937, and grew up in Floral Park before his family moved to Bay Shore.

For the first time, I wasn't scared of him. I was scared for him.\n\nIt was revealed that after an innocuous autograph signing in Florida, \"Kevin suffered a devastating accident. He underwent emergency surgery that saved his leg and life but faced severe complications, including sepsis and encephalitis. This unforseen catastrophe has placed an immense financial burden on his family, as Kevin has been in and out of consciousness in the ICU, far from home. Despite these challenges, Kevin has shown incredible resilience. Months later, he is still fighting to regain his independence.\"\n\nThe campaign gained momentum for Kevin quickly, as his colleagues, fans and closest friends far surpassed the fundraising goal. Recent support for Sullivan reached a fever pitch, as he was not only among the most respected people in the industry, but incredibly beloved.\n\nSullivan was no stranger to overcoming odds. As a young man, he had contracted rheumatic fever. Recalling this, Sullivan said, \"I was in bed for a year, I didn't walk for a year.\" As a eight year old boy, he would quickly find his life's passion in his family's Cambridge basement, overtaking the television. This became his \"wrestling school.\" \"I actually started in my basement,\" Kevin quipped. \"I found a set of weights and that's how I started working out.\"\n\nBy his late teens, he began wrestling in the northeast. Lacking any formal training, he used his intelligence and absorbed the knowledge much quicker than the average young prospect. A run in Tennessee caught the eye of the legendary Eddie Graham, who brought him to Florida where the magic would reveal itself to the unsuspecting people at the Tampa Armory. \"Eddie Graham used to say it takes five years to understand what you're doing. For me, it was about five years or maybe a little earlier because I had some great teachers.\"\n\nPerhaps the most notorious moment surrounding the notorious heel wrestler is one he really had nothing to do with intentionally. When working as the head booker for World Championship Wrestling, he wrote out an angle for the \"Canadian Crippler\" Chris Benoit to work with his then-wife Nancy Toffoloni as his sometimes valet. Fiction later became fact as Nancy would leave Kevin for Benoit, and the subsequent vicious 2007 murder-suicide of the Benoit family would have Kevin's name dragged into it, despite no actual evidence of his involvement.\n\nFor me, Sullivan was just a little different than anybody else in pro wrestling. The first thing that stood out upon sight was the fact he was only 5'9\", but he was built like a brick house. Within seconds of a match beginning, you'd forget his size, because he was so good at his character and working a match through it. He carried an \"aura\" of sorts, because he had such a devious mind that you never thought he was ever truly out of a contest. The Sullivan character was willing to go to the deepest places to inflict physical or mental harm, and at no place did he do this more than he did working in Florida.\n\nThe Varsity Club was the first instance of workplace bullying I could ever recall witnessing. A group of amateur, college-type wrestlers brought together not unlike what Chad Gable is doing today with the Creeds in its embryonic state. Sullivan was the de facto leader, flanked by a very young Mike Rotundo & Rick Steiner. Weekly, the \"Taskmaster\" would berate the young Steiner for mistakes that probably weren't his fault. Each passing week in the territory, Sullivan dug deeper into the young Michigan stud. Slowly, it began to break Steiner, where he would finally turn on his mentor with great cheers and even greater violence. Several years later, he would do the same to his own \"brother,\" Dave (affectionately known as EVAD, in perhaps the first ever passing mention of dyslexia in professional sports) to similar results, although Dave wasn't exactly Steiner.\n\nThe Dungeon of Doom was a Sullivan creation, and in the same concept of Bobby Heenan and his own \"family,\" Kevin assembled perhaps the most eclectic group of wrestlers ever in an attempt to destroy WCW's newest star, Hulk Hogan. From \"Iron Gates of Fate,\" on May 21, 1995, and until mid 1997, everyone from Kamala, Vader, Meng to the Yeti, Braun the Leprechaun, Loch Ness and of course, Beefcake as \"The Zodiac\" tortured the Hulkster, fans and random babyfaces as it just seemed like Kevin was having fun. One Man Gang, Lex Luger, a very young Paul Wight as \"The Giant,\" Konnan and The Barbarian, John Tenta as \"The Shark,\" even \"The Ultimate Solution.\" Prince Iaukea as \"The Master?\" \"Bubba\" wasn't quite the Boss Man we remembered, and Z-Gangsta wasn't quite Tiny Lister's \"Zeus,\" and Bill DeMott was still learning as \"Hugh Morris,\" so it was always interesting when it wasn't great. Even Jaqueline was there for a while. Sullivan kept it going on the independents after he left WCW, adding in Gangrel and his wife, Luna Vachon. You could tell when he was doing the Dungeon of Doom gimmick, he was having a blast just being creative and evil.\n\nAs a talker, Kevin was as good as anyone in his day. Perhaps the closest comparison would be peak Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts in terms of cadence and depth. Sullivan said things you didn't say in pro wrestling. Kevin talked with an evil stare, almost hunched over (despite his size). He scared you. He told you how you would be hurt, and how it would affect you. Then, he'd carry it out. You didn't want to listen, you had to.\n\nKevin basically worked everywhere but WWE is his illustrious career. His closeness to the Rhodes' family and Paul Levesque's love for Jim Crockett Promotions and the classic NWA leads me to believe Sullivan would have been eventually inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame at some point, unfortunately it would now be post-humanously. Sullivan is in the NWA Hall, along with the New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame, but his work and mind deserve to be honored in the highest possible platforms.\n\nHis influence ranges from Rick Steiner's head gear to Chad Gable's abuses of Otis. Bray Wyatt isn't formed without his dad's time in the Varsity Club tapping into Kevin's mind. His mind was tapped into as a part of TNA, Smoky Mountain and the Eastern Championship Wrestling era, working with a young Tasmaniac and Shane Douglas before he would throw the title in the trash and rename the Philadelphia group. It's even rumored Sullivan's leaving was to enable Paul Heyman to take over booking, although that's been disputed. His creativity was as much his as it was learned from the Graham family and working alongside Dusty, the Briscos, Bill Watts and Ole Anderson.\n\nThis was a tough, smart guy who was beloved by those he worked with, and us fans who booed him. He's remembered as the Taskmaster. I will remember him as somebody who busted his ass to overcome odds and change the business. Kevin, I miss you already.

The news was broken Friday morning by Pro Wrestling Insider. Sullivan had been dealing with health issues lately following complications from emergency surgery.\n\nSullivan is perhaps most notable to a certain generation of wrestling fans as the leader of the Three Faces of Fear and the Dungeon of Doom, stables that menaced Hulk Hogan in 1990s WCW prior to Hogan's heel turn and \"Hollywood\" persona as part of the New World Order. He's also remembered for his role in the intricate backstage politics of WCW, including his personal and professional rivalry with the late Chris Benoit and the infamous \"I respect you, bookerman\" incident involving Brian Pillman. Appropriately, Sullivan's last match as a wrestler was against Pillman's son, current \"WWE NXT\" star Lexis King, in 2019.\n\nWrestling Inc. sends our best wishes to Sullivan's friends and family.", "source": {"uri": "wrestlinginc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wrestling Inc."}, "authors": [{"uri": "miles_schneiderman@wrestlinginc.com", "name": "Miles Schneiderman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sullivan_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faces_of_Fear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faces of Fear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Scherer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Scherer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dungeon_of_Doom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dungeon of Doom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dirt sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New World Order (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Pillman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Pillman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Benoit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.wrestlinginc.com/img/gallery/kevin-sullivan-dead-renowned-territory-villain-wcw-booker-reportedly-dies-at-age-74/l-intro-1723205643.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804367", "eventUri": "eng-9804367", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

His name is trending this morning, along with another former Superstar that WWE doesn't talk about.\n\nKevin Sullivan was a pro wrestling trailblazer, but that didn't come without controversy. Since the tragic events surrounding Chris Benoit's death and the murder of his son and wife, Nancy, Kevin Sullivan has been linked through conspiracy theory. Some fans have theorized that Sullivan had something to do with the tragedy.\n\nDuring a 2015 episode of The Ross Report, 'Good Ol J.R.' Jim Ross hosted Kevin Sullivan for a two-part interview where Sullivan discussed the Chris Benoit tragedy and the departure of Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn from WCW in 2000.\n\nRegarding the Benoit tragedy, Sullivan, often accused of involvement due to his past relationship with Benoit's wife, Nancy, revealed that conspiracy theories bothered him for a long time. Sullivan told Ross he couldn't attend Nancy's funeral because of the intense media scrutiny.\n\n\"And [the speculation] did bother me for a while, Jim, until I talked to [Nancy's] mother and she said, 'I can't believe that people even think that,' and she made me feel better. The sister made me feel better.\"\n\nSullivan suggested that he was blamed for the tragedy because fans did not want to believe Benoit was a bad person.\n\n\"This is how people are so sick and so much of an idol-worship. They were looking for, and I don't mean this in any bad light, but they were looking for an out because he was a great, great, great, fabulous wrestler. We'll never know what caused it, but for people to believe something like that, means they believe that the earth is hollow or flat or whatever.\"\n\nStill, Kevin Sullivan was a popular topic of conversation within the internet wrestling community today, and so was Chris Benoit. One fan tweeted out to say, \"Chris Benoit vs Kevin Sullivan gonna sell out crowds in hell.\" Another posted a meme of an impatient Mr. Bean with a caption reading, \"Chris Benoit in Heaven waiting for Kevin Sullivan (in hell for practicing witchcraft and murder).\"\n\nFans were quite bold, and many of them believed the unfounded conspiracy theory about how Kevin Sullivan was responsible for the tragedy surrounding Chris Benoit's death. One fan tweeted out a photo of Benoit along with, \"Chris Benoit looking down from heaven, 'they finally got the real murderer.'\"\n\nThe pro wrestling world reacted to honor Kevin Sullivan after his passing. Triple H also dropped a touching tribute. Still, the pro wrestling fan base also did their thing, and it caused Chris Benoit to trend while they were at it. This was certainly an unintended effect of losing a pro wrestling legend.\n\nYou can check out a few of the many tweets mentioning Chris Benoit below, and why it caused him to trend on Friday, August 9, 2024. Our thoughts are with Kevin Sullivan's family during this sad time of loss.\n\nWhat's your take on this reaction from the pro wrestling fan base after Kevin Sullivan's passing? Do you think that they should have a more respectful reaction?

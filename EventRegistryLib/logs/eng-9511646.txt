And who's to say the Dolphins won't be moving up if there's a prospect they really like but fear will be drafted before their turn arrives.\n\nBecause they're drafting relatively late in the first round, it's much more difficult to pin down exactly what the Dolphins will do, as evidenced by the fact the 31 national mock drafts we analyzed Wednesday had 12 different players as the projection.\n\nAnd then a 13th different name was mentioned Thursday morning when NFL Network's Peter Schrager released his day-of mock draft with a twist involving the Dolphins.\n\nSo what's the most ideal option? As always, that's subject to debate, but here's our take on all the possibilities.\n\nThis was the overwhelming choice among the national mock drafts and the reasoning is sound, that the Dolphins need to be better up front if they want to compete with the heavyweights in December and January, something they failed to do last season when they came up short against Baltimore, Buffalo and Kansas City in their final three games.\n\nWith three starters back from last season -- Terron Armstead, Isaiah Wynn and Austin Jackson -- and free agent Aaron Brewer arriving from Tennessee, the obvious spot to upgrade is at right guard, where right now we'd be looking at a competition between Robert Jones, Liam Eichenberg, Lester Cotton and newcomer Jack Driscoll.\n\nThen there's the two-year view, which suggests a tackle would be a good choice because Kendall Lamm already has said he's retiring after the 2024 season and Armstead has said he's contemplated retirement after the past few offseasons.\n\nSo in a perfect world, the pick would be a tackle of the future who could handle a guard position as a rookie and represent an upgrade at that position, something like what the Dolphins did with Laremy Tunsil in 2016.\n\nTroy Fautanu from Washington looks like the ideal candidate for that role, but most projections have him gone before the Dolphins' turn at 21. So maybe he's that one prospect for whom the Dolphins should consider giving up future assets.\n\nHe's that much of an ideal pick.\n\nThe name Graham Barton also has been mentioned because of his versatility, though most draft analysts agree his best position in the NFL will be center. And while there's a school of thought he's versatile enough that he could line up anywhere on the offensive line, there is risk involved in having him play a different position as an NFL rookie.\n\nAnother popular choice in the national mock drafts was tackle Amarius Mims from Georgia, the prospect with perhaps the biggest upside of any offensive lineman in the draft. But he's also got very limited experience, may not be able to contribute very much as a rookie, and is viewed as a tackle only.\n\nSo this would be a pick made almost strictly with 2025 and beyond in mind, and the Dolphins still are in a win-now mode, so that pick doesn't make much sense from that standpoint.\n\nJackson Powers-Johnson from Oregon is another lineman that's been linked to the Dolphins, but he's an interior lineman only, so he would have to represent a massive upgrade at guard for that selection to make sense.\n\nThis is the player most often connected to the Dolphins based on our national mock draft survey, and that was before highly respected NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah joined the parade in his mock unveiled Wednesday night.\n\nThe logic behind this move is sound, that Newton could help the Dolphins somewhat make up for the departure of Christian Wilkins with his disruptive play in the middle of the defensive line.\n\nYes, it can be countered that the Dolphins already addressed the defensive tackle position by signing seven -- yes, seven -- players at the position in the offseason: Benito Jones, Teair Tart, Jonathan Harris, Neville Gallimore, Isaiah Mack, Daviyon Nixon and Da'Shawn Hand (in his case, re-signed).\n\nAnd one absolutely can wonder whether it would be overkill for the Dolphins to add yet another defensive tackle and they would have to think that Newton has to chance to be awfully special to make that move.\n\nFrom this vantage point, it's definitely an option to consider, though it certainly wouldn't be at the top of the list.\n\nThis maybe wouldn't even be a consideration if not the concerns about when Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips will be back from their 2023 season-ending injuries and more importantly when they'll be back to being Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips.\n\nGiven the work ethic of each player, there's absolutely reason to be optimistic that it could happen early in the 2024 season, but there certainly are no guarantees.\n\nThe Dolphins did add depth at the position when they signed veteran Shaquil Barrett after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers let him go, but added protection certainly can't hurt -- for the present and the future.\n\nLike many high-priced Dolphins veterans, Chubb doesn't have any guaranteed money remaining beyond this year, which is why Spotrac lists the 2025 offseason as the potential \"out\" from under Chubb's contract.\n\nThe edge defenders mentioned in our mock draft survey as a potential Dolphins pick were Jared Verse from Florida and Laiatu Latu from UCLA.\n\nLatu is viewed as the better prospect, but he does come with a medical question mark after his career was put on hold because University of Washington wouldn't clear him because of a neck issue.\n\nAnother question with both prospects is whether either will be available at 21.\n\nGiven the risk involved with Latu, maybe Verse would be the better option here if the Dolphins can land him.\n\nLook, we get Mike McDaniel's fascination with speed and it would be crazy to think what the Dolphins offense would look like with Worthy, the combine 40-yard dash record-holder, but would that really put the Dolphins closer to the elite teams in the AFC?\n\nThe answer from here is no.\n\nThe idea of drafting a bigger wide receiver to add a different element to the passing game has been mentioned as well, and Brian Thomas Jr. from LSU is the player mentioned here.\n\nBut adding another offensive playmaker doesn't feel like a top priority at the top of the draft, particularly considering the very large number of quality wide receivers in the draft.\n\nThat position should be addressed later, quite frankly.\n\nFor those who have forgotten, the Dolphins don't have a third-round pick because it was part of the sanctions for tampering with Tom Brady and Sean Payton and they don't have a fourth-round selection because it was part of the trade that brought Chubb over from the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Dolphins have a lot of talent on their roster, but they're also very top-heavy with a lot of potential changes coming sooner rather than later.\n\nTo be able to achieve consistent success through the years, the Dolphins probably need to upgrade their base of young talent (especially cheap young talent), so it just may be that more is better for this draft.\n\nThere also is a good chance that there will be several prospects between 21 and 28, 29, 30 who all could help the Dolphins, both in 2024 and beyond, and who have very little separation in terms of prospect potential, and it says here that picking up a third-round pick, for example, would be worth moving down a few slots.\n\nOption number 1 from here would be trading down in the first round and picking up a third-round pick in the process.\n\nOption number 2 would be that tackle of the future who could play guard in his first season or maybe his first two.\n\nOption number 3 would be an edge defender to add depth and provide insurance.\n\nOption number 4 would be Jer'Zhan Newton as the disruptive interior defensive lineman, the new Christian Wilkins, if you will.\n\nThe wild card would be taking Iowa cornerback Cooper DeJean with the idea of using him at safety in a role similar to what the Baltimore Ravens have done with Kyle Hamilton.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

If someone wants to drop to our spot and we move down and pick up extra picks, we're very open to that too as well.\"\n\nMiami didn't select until the third round in 2022 after using its first- and second-round picks to acquire Tyreek Hill from Kansas City. The Dolphins forfeited their 2023 first-rounder after they violated the league's antitampering policy by communicating with Tom Brady and Sean Payton, and they traded another first-round pick away to acquire star pass rusher Bradley Chubb from Denver.\n\nThe Dolphins have lost a slew of free agents that were key contributors to a roster coming off a second consecutive postseason berth. Standout defensive tackle Christian Wilkins, right guard Rob Hunt and linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel all signed deals elsewhere. And the Dolphins also cut linebacker Jerome Baker and veteran cornerback Xavien Howard, leaving the team with several holes to address in free agency and the draft.\n\nHill and Jaylen Waddle combined for more yards (2,813) than any other wide receiver duo in the NFL in 2023. Miami has depth concerns at wide receiver beyond those two, which was evident late last season as Hill and Waddle dealt with injuries. Other priorities for Miami include adding help to the interior offensive line to protect quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. The Dolphins could also use another edge rusher, with Chubb (ACL) and Jaelan Phillips (Achilles tendon) coming off significant injuries.\n\nThe Dolphins appear to be set at running back after extending Raheem Mostert, who set career highs in rushing yards (1,012) and total touchdowns (21). The Dolphins also having speedy second-year running back De'Von Achane, who had 800 yards rushing and 7.8 yards per carry his rookie season.\n\nMiami needs a third receiving option behind Hill and Waddle. No other Dolphins receiver had more than 27 catches or 300 yards last season -- their third-leading receiver was tight end Durham Smythe with 366 yards on 35 catches. The Dolphins have not addressed the position yet in free agency, although they held a visit with veteran Odell Beckham Jr. in March and made him an offer, according to McDaniel.\n\n\"Things went great with him,\" McDaniel said during the NFL's league meetings last month. \"We did make him an offer and business takes time, especially with players like Odell, who's had a phenomenal career and still has really good football in front of him and has options. I think those conversations will be ongoing. We'll see where they go.\"\n\nWhile the Dolphins are set at quarterback with Tagovailoa, whom Grier said the team intends to reach a long-term deal with, Miami could use a late-round pick to add insurance at the backup spot. Backup Mike White is set to become a free agent next offseason, and Skylar Thompson did not play last season. The Dolphins could also use a tackle to develop under veteran left tackle Terron Armstead, who was sidelined multiple games the past two seasons because of injuries and briefly considered retirement after the 2023 season.\n\nThe Dolphins also forfeited their 2023 third-rounder for tampering and sent their fourth to the Broncos in the deal that brought over Chubb.", "source": {"uri":

Who will Xavien Howard play for next?\n\nXavien Howard has been a key part of the Miami Dolphins' secondary for the past several seasons. Howard and Jalen Ramsey were headliners in the back end of Miami's defense during the team's impressive turnaround season. Unfortunately, the Dolphins decided to part ways with Howard earlier this offseason in part due to an ankle injury. It appears that Howard's health is progressing well and there's hope he could see the field in 2024.\n\nAccording to NFL insider Tom Pelissero, the four-time Pro Bowl CB Xavien Howard was fully cleared for football activities earlier this month. His doctor informed teams in a letter.\n\nHoward battled a foot injury throughout the 2023 season. He is now a free agent and could provide some potential post-draft help for a cornerback-needy team.\n\nDolphins beat reporter Omar Kelly reported that Howard was seen running and cutting in late February, a good sign in the recovery from his foot injury. However, the Dolphins cut Howard in the middle of March with a post-June 1st release designation. The Miami Dolphins will recoup roughly $18.5 million in salary cap savings due to the post-June 1st designation, as opposed to only saving $2.8 million by releasing him right away.\n\nXavien Howard was drafted in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins. In 100 career games, Howard has logged 29 interceptions, two pick sixes, 95 passes defensed, and 331 tackles. He has a career passer rating allowed of 79.2.\n\nWhich NFL teams might be interested in signing Xavien Howard?\n\nThere should be several teams interested in Xavien Howard once we inch closer to training camp.\n\nIt is hard to predict who exactly may want Xavien Howard right now because the 2024 NFL Draft is one day away. Several teams will take care of their cornerback needs over the next week between draft picks and signing undrafted free agents.\n\nTherefore, for our purposes, we're going to limit Howard's best fits to contending teams that may want the veteran help and who would still likely be interested in Howard following the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nIn the AFC, both the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars make a ton of sense for Howard.\n\nCornerback is the primary need for Jacksonville entering the draft. Their current starters include Ronald Darby and Tyson Campbell. The Jaguars are a solid option because they will need a veteran presence in their cornerback room and could use reliable reinforcements coming off the bench.\n\nThe Houston Texans have Derek Stingley Jr., but behind him it is all question marks. Jeff Okudah, former first-round pick, is the next best option. The Texans have invested heavily on defense this offseason and adding Howard could help elevate Houston's secondary.\n\nIn the NFC, both the Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles could be interested in adding Howard.\n\nDetroit is undergoing a complete makeover of its cornerback room. The Lions cut Cameron Sutton and have needed a number one cornerback since the departure of Darius Slay. Howard won't be that guy, but Detroit could use all the help it can get.\n\nPhiladelphia could stand to add another veteran to their cornerback room that features Darius Slay, James Bradberry, and Avonte Maddox.\n\nXavien Howard should have no shortage of suitors this summer.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Everybody wants to show that they said months ago that a player was going to be good so badly. It's hilarious as it is exhausting and lame but hey that's the world of content.\n\nAnyway, the Miami Dolphins have an opportunity to address an issue that they haven't been able to solve for years and that's the offensive line.\n\nI know Chris Grier thought he was being smug and cool when he famously said \"You guys are probably more worried about the offensive line than we are.\" Hey Chris (as I'm sure he's reading this), guess what happened? You lost your starting center and left guard and had nothing behind it. Oh, and you're big ticket left tackle who had a big injury history before you traded for him, turns out he still gets gurt a ton.\n\nBut I'm not here to live in the past. I'm focused on the here and now while also having one eye on the future.\n\nIf the Miami Dolphins stay at #21 and take the best player available, I'd be smitten with that. I'd endorse that plan and probably wouldn't have any issue with it. It appears there is going to be a predictable overreaction by teams to draft mid-QBs in the 1st round, something you'd think teams would learn not to do. Bo Nix and JJ McCarthy going in the middle of the 1st is laughable to me but hey maybe I'll be dead wrong. Again, nobody knows how guys will perform once they get to their team.\n\nIf Grier and the gang have a non-offensive lineman on their board who is their best available player, go for it. That doesn't mean that I and the rest of society will agree. But I get the best player available argument.\n\nSince the draft process started, I've subscribed to the idea that the Miami Dolphins should trade down and get an extra pick. Even since Grier did solid work and retooled the roster after losing Wilkins, Hunt, and Van Ginkel, I still want the Dolphins to trade down somewhere in the 1st round while gathering something like a 3rd round pick.\n\nI think because of the run of teams drafting mid-QBs plus the draft being deep at wide receiver and offensive tackle, the Miami Dolphins are in a prime position no matter what they do to upgrade the offensive line. This is what I strongly feel the Miami Dolphins should do.\n\nThink about it. If the Miami Dolphins go back-to-back offensive line, they can be set up with a young and talented offensive line for years. Austin Jackson is amazingly 24 and Aaron Brewer is 26.\n\nIf the Dolphins go offensive tackle at #21 and then go interior offensive line in the 2nd round, man alive that would make me feel all types of things. It wouldn't be flashy but it would be smart.\n\nIf you shore up the offensive line, you have a better chance of preserving Tua and this offense. I'm not saying receivers are a dime a dozen but honestly, I think the wide receiver position is turning into the running back position. There are so many quality receivers seemingly every year in the draft that you can wait on them and get a solid player in the later rounds. You can't wait on quality offensive linemen nearly as often. Sure, some late-round pick linemen end up being great. But you can say that at any position.\n\nHow often are the Dolphins and other teams looking for a guard or tackle near training camp and beyond only to see that teams don't let go of good offensive linemen? Every year is the answer.\n\nMike McDaniel can get Tua to perform well with a very good offensive line. I believe that. I don't think he can get Tua and the offense humming without a quality offensive line even if the receivers are excellent, which they are right now. Receivers want to play in this system in Miami so attracting playmakers once Tyreek Hill is gone, whenever that happens, doesn't concern me.\n\nWhat concerns me is patching up the offensive line in the middle of the season and seeing guys like Liam Eichenberg on the bench and having to put him in to play center when he's never done it before. That worries me.\n\nA reason I would love for the Miami Dolphins to address the offensive line a real way with their first two picks is that it would indicate that the regime understands that they have and have had an issue with this group and they decided to take care of it in this draft.\n\nFans respect a vision or a direction even if it's not what they exactly wanted. Miami going all in on the offensive line indicates that the brass is looking to maintain the type of offense we saw last year.\n\nIt's the kind of thing like when you see a person with really good self-awareness. You may not love everything they do but you say \"At least they know what they want and damn everyone else who tells them to stop doing what they're doing.\" The Dolphins committing to the offensive line is the kind of stance the fanbase would get behind.\n\nAt this point, I think most of us know what guys to expect to possibly be around at #21. I wrote last week that Troy Fautanu out of Washington would be a steal if he gets there. Graham Barton is another guy who is being reported the Dolphins are researching.\n\nAs for interior linemen to be had in the 2nd round, Jackson Powers-Johnson is my white whale. This guy can be our center for seven to eight years or more. Christian Haynes from Connecticut is a pure guard that we can all envision taking the Robert Hunt role, seamlessly, like Gil took Landfill's role in Beer Fest(go watch that movie, you'll respect yourself in the morning.)\n\nAnd since we know that Chris Grier is a wheeling-dealing son of a gun, the idea of him trading to get closer to the beginning of the 2nd round to get one of the better interior offensive linemen is something that is a viable option that I would soundly support.\n\nThere are so many good players that it's hard for me to see how the Grier and the Dolphins mess this up. Unless they take a corner at #21 even if it is their best player available, there aren't many scenarios where I think I'd walk away annoyed and depleted. Now, that doesn't mean they can't surprise me and do a boneheaded move. It's the Miami Dolphins we're talking about. I just think there are enough quality players to pull off a good and smart early part of the draft.\n\nIf this is the last time I speak to y'all before the NFL Draft, drink and eat well during it. And remember, none of us know very much and we're hoping the folks whose job it is to figure out who is going to be good and who doesn't have it know what they're doing. Enjoy the draft and joy of thinking that the Miami Dolphins may have a real chance of taking the Lombardi next year and that whoever they pick was the correct pick. I know I'll be doing those mental gymnastics if that's the way it goes.", "source": {"uri": "phinphanatic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phin Phanatic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Nix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bo Nix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Grier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Grier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McDaniel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike McDaniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Jackson_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Jackson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Eichenberg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Eichenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreek_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyreek Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2717,h_1528,x_0,y_542/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/62/01hw85wp1brknzzv1yzc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511646", "eventUri": "eng-9511646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

As the draft draws near, here are our final predictions for all seven rounds of the Dolphins draft.\n\nThe biggest question facing the Dolphins is whether or not they will stay put at 21 or trade down. I would love to see a trade-down, even if it meant out of round one entirely. Chris Grier has shown a willingness to move around but with only six draft picks this year, will he risk losing a top, round-one prospect for more picks in the mid-rounds? That depends on if he believes he can find the value in those rounds.\n\nWhen the Dolphins are on the clock, I think Grier stays put and makes his selection. He has too many holes to fill and while he doesn't have the draft picks to fill them, he can't afford the risk. Not when a quality player will fill one of those voids.\n\nI don't see the Dolphins fanbase being thrilled with Miami's first pick. Frankly, I don't see players like Troy Fautanu, who should be the Dolphins' number one choice, or Brian Thomas, Jr. the best WR who could be available, actually, well, available at 21. I think Grier makes a safe pick.\n\nLooking at the draft, Grier has never drafted a guard/center in round one and that may not change this year. A tackle is possible but he would have to be able to play guard and I don't know if Grier is planning for a future without Terron Armstead just yet.\n\nThis is a matter of Chris Grier moving from on from his annual M.O. of not drafting interior offensive linemen. Barton is different. He is athletic, strong, and quick. He can play center, guard, and tackle providing Butch Barry versatility. The Dolphins have to protect Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nMike McDaniel may not be thrilled with the pick on a personal level. There have been reports that he is interested in Xavier Worthy of Texas. I simply don't see how the Dolphins can pass on a player that will start immediately as a rookie and then take over left tackle once Terron Armstead retires.", "source": {"uri": "phinphanatic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phin Phanatic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Grier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Grier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McDaniel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike McDaniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tua_Tagovailoa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tua Tagovailoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terron_Armstead", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terron Armstead"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_596/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/62/01hw3jcr5rpsssdhd15w.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511646", "eventUri": "eng-9511646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Free agency shook up the roster too, leaving the Dolphins needing to address some positions more than others.\n\nHere are the five positions the Dolphins need to address most in the 2024 NFL draft:\n\n1 Interior offensive line\n\nJaylynn Nash-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMiami's interior offensive line was already worth addressing, but free agency made it even more crucial. Former Dolphins guard Robert Hunt was one of the big winners of March when he received a five-year, $100 million contract from the Carolina Panthers.\n\nHunt's departure leaves Miami looking for an answer to help bolster the interior of the line.\n\nIf the season started today, the projected starters from left guard to right guard would likely be Isaiah Wynn, Aaron Brewer, and Robert Jones.\n\nWynn is a former tackle who was converted to guard, and is coming off an injury-shortened season that earned him a brutal Pro Football Focus grade of 47.8. Miami signed Brewer from the Titans to a three-year, $21 million deal after he graded out at a solid 71.6 PFF grade. And Jones is coming off a season where he earned a 57.6 PFF rating as a reserve who was thrust into action for five starts.\n\nWhile Brewer looks to be a relatively long-term option at center with flexibility to play guard, Miami should look to add someone to the interior that can compete to start ahead or Jones or Wynn starting Week 1.\n\nIn the first round, the Dolphins could set their sights on Duke offensive lineman Graham Barton, Washington offensive lineman Troy Fautanu, or Oregon center Jackson Powers-Johnson for their interior.\n\n2 Interior defensive line\n\nJohn David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAs important as the offensive trenches are, the Dolphins could also add to their defensive interior.\n\nPrior to free agency, Miami's roster was pretty set at the position. But now the Dolphins will have an entirely new group on the defensive line. Defensive tackle Christian Wilkins signed with the Raiders on a four-year, $110 million contract, and Raekwon Davis left for a two-year, $14 million deal with the Colts.\n\nJonathan Harris, Neville Gallimore, Benito Jones and Teair Tart -- all signed in free agency -- should help add depth to the room, but with Zach Sieler being the best man on the defensive front, selecting a defensive lineman with their first pick could be in play for the Dolphins.\n\nIf they look to add someone in the first round, they could look at Texas' Byron Murphy II or Illinois' Jer'Zhan Newton.\n\n3 Offensive tackle\n\nDale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe situation at offensive tackle isn't as pressing as the interior, but Miami should strongly consider adding a player that can play for them on the outside. If the Dolphins don't love the interior offensive lineman options, tackle could definitely be in play.\n\nTerron Armstead and Austin Jackson form a solid pair of tackles, but neither should stop Miami from considering adding a tackle. Armstead is almost a guarantee to miss at least a few games during the season and 2024 could be his last before retirement.\n\nThe Dolphins may not want to commit to someone who would only be viable on the outside if they are confident in their current pair. But if they decide to patiently develop a tackle, Fautanu, Alabama tackle's JC Latham, Penn State's Olu Fashanu or Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga could all be solid options -- especially since those four should be able to play on the outside after starting their career on the inside.\n\n4 Edge rusher\n\nJim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dolphins have two strong players on the edge, so the position might not be the first place Miami would think to go in the draft. However, their players' current situations could make edge rusher a worthwhile investment.\n\nJaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb are both first-round caliber players, and Miami invested heavily in them -- Phillips in the draft and Chubb via trade -- however, they aren't as immediately reliable as one might hope.\n\nPhillips was injury prone in college, but was mostly healthy throughout his professional career. However, he suffered a season-ending Achilles injury last season, putting his status for the start of the season in doubt.\n\nChubb has struggled staying healthy during the majority of his time in the NFL and suffered an ACL tear at the end of the 2023 season.\n\nBoth Phillips and Chubb are talented and productive players, but neither is a guarantee to start Week 1 or stay healthy for 17 games. Couple that with lackluster depth behind that duo and a first-round investment in another edge rusher would be more than logical.\n\nThis year's draft boasts three top-tier edge prospects: Alabama's Dallas Turner, UCLA's Laiatu Latu, and Florida State's Jared Verse.\n\n5 Wide receiver\n\nRicardo B. Brazziell / USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nAny team with Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle is looking good at the wide receiver position. However, depth at the position and a strong receiver class could make the position intriguing for Dolphins general manager Chris Grier.\n\nOutside of Hill and Waddle, the Dolphins are rounded out by the likes of Braxton Berrios and River Cracraft as the next most experienced players at the position. If Hill or Waddle miss time due to injury, which happened a couple times in 2023, it would be best if Miami had more talented players for quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to target.\n\nThe good thing about the 2024 wide receiver class is Miami could add contributors well into the middle of the draft.\n\nIf they look at the position early, LSU receiver Brian Thomas Jr., Texas pass catchers Adonai Mitchell and Xavier Worthy, or Oregon's Troy Franklin could be in play. The Dolphins could also wait to snag a talented player at the position in the second round or later.", "source": {"uri": "dolphinswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dolphins Wire"},

I'm talking about Texas wide receiver Xavier Worthy, who has repeatedly been linked to the Dolphins over the last several weeks. But then again, maybe with a run-on offensive linemen expected, the Dolphins could have a talented defensive lineman fall into their lap. Which, ironically enough, is something McDaniel once said was his favorite position to scout.\n\nHere's what Miami's head coach said about the defensive line's importance after the team signed Trey Flowers on September 1st, 2022.\n\nNow, do you think the Dolphins will draft a defensive lineman?\n\nIt's hard to say what players will be available when Miami is on the clock without knowing how the board will fall. However, we can hypothesize who may be available based on team needs. Based entirely on Miami's need and the players I've watched intently this draft season, I've come up with a list of six players I would like to hear called when the Miami Dolphins are on the clock with the 21st overall pick in the first round of tonight's NFL Draft.\n\nHere are six players the Miami Dolphins should select in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\n2023 College Stats: 49 total tackles, 13 sacks, two forced fumbles, two interceptions, two pass breakups.\n\nMuch like Jaelan Phillips a few seasons ago, Laiatu Latu caught my eye instantly. He's fast AF off the EDGE and can win in various ways. Additionally, I was impressed with his hand usage and ability to bend around the outside. Like Phillips, he also has an endless motor that never quits. All of these are traits I believe Miami's coaches will love. Ironically enough, however, the most significant question mark surrounding Latu -- like Phillips coming out -- is his health. In 2021, Latu was forced to medically retire from Washington, but like his doppelganger, he never gave up. Now, he's sure to hear his name called on night one. And if I have things my way, it will be to the Miami Dolphins with the 21st pick in the 2024 NFL Draft...\n\n2023 College Stats: 41 total tackles, nine sacks, one forced fumble, two pass breakups.\n\nOne of the names the Dolphins have been linked to most over the last few weeks has been Florida State pass-rusher Jared Verse. The former Albany Great Dane can win several ways, but his Scott Steiner-like power and ability to contain the EDGE stood out most when watching the film. At times, Verse would make an opposing lineman look like a blocking sled or a small child, moving him with relative ease into the quarterback's lap. Despite that power, he also showed an explosive first step, and his 4.58 speed makes him a literal nightmare for opposing quarterbacks. I like Latu more, but with medical concerns and Verse being more of a well-rounded prospect, I could see Verse being the Dolphins' pick at 21.\n\n2023 College Stats: 52 total tackles, 7.5 sacks, one forced fumble, one recovery, two pass breakups.\n\nWith Christian Wilkins making bank in Las Vegas, the Dolphins have a rather large hole to fill on the defensive line alongside the world's most underrated player, Zach Sieler. Miami has decided to go with a stable of veterans eager to prove they belong. But what if they wanted to draft Wilkins' replacement? If that's what Miami hopes to come away with in round one, the name I'd look at is Illinois defensive tackle. Sure, Texas' Byron Murphy II seems to be the higher-ranked defensive tackle among the draft pundits, but based on games I've watched, something about Newton made me feel a type of way. He's a game-wrecker who can disrupt things in the backfield at a second's notice -- the perfect mix of power and speed. There will never be another salt and pepper, but Johnny Newton and Zach Sieler wouldn't be too far off. Like Wilkins, it wouldn't be the sexiest pick, but I think fans would come to love the type of player Newton quickly is.\n\n2023 College Stats: 41 total tackles, two interceptions, five pass breakups.\n\nWhen Anthony Weaver signed on as the Dolphins' new defensive coordinator, we first heard from all the 'eXpERts' on social media that it was necessary to have three safeties in this defense. If that's true and my numbers are correct, Miami's current safeties are Jevon Holland and 32-year-old Jordan Poyer. This leads me to my next player, Iowa defensive back Cooper DeJean. DeJean is a versatile player who would allow the Dolphins to get creative in the secondary. He's shown he can play at a high level on the outside, inside, and at safety, making him the perfect pick if Miami plans to move around cornerback Jalen Ramsey more this season. Oh, and he also has some return abilities. I'm not sure where he'd play to start, but long-term having a combination of Holland and DeJean in the secondary feels like an excellent problem with how explosive offenses are quickly becoming.\n\nYes, I know this is now Graham Barton's spot in the pecking order, but it feels like just yesterday that many Dolphins fans were banging the table for Oregon Ducks' center Jackson Powers-Johnson. As I usually do, I try to stick to my guns for better or worse. Thus, making my JPJ my choice for Miami's starting center/guard of the future. The athletic, violent interior offensive lineman could fill a need on Miami's line immediately at guard, with the potential to eventually be the team's starting center. Or, if you've been listening to Another Dolphins Podcast, you would know how Brian Baldinger feels about Aaron Brewer playing center... which could open the door for Powers-Johnson to start at center sooner rather than later. He might have fallen down the pecking order, but in my heart, JPJ is still one of one if Chris Grier and Co. plan to draft an offensive lineman.\n\n2023 College Stats: 75 receptions, 1,014 yards, five touchdowns.\n\nMaybe it's the never-ending Worthy highlights I've seen on #DolphinsTwitter the last several days, but I have to be honest: I've really warmed up to the idea of the Dolphins drafting the king of speed, Xavier Worthy. Yes, he's only 175 pounds, and some might view him (ignorantly) as only a deep threat. But when you turn on the film, you see that not only is he the fastest human ever timed at the combine, but the tape says he's a more refined receiver than many give him credit for. Couple that with Miami's need for a third receiving target, the rumors we continue to hear about their interest in Worthy, and the (potential) uncertainty surrounding the long-term futures of Hill & Waddle, and I don't know that I'd be as surprised as I once was if Worthy is Miami's pick. However, it would definitely be more palatable via trade-down or early in the second round.\n\n[Please Note: My brain tells me that the Dolphins should draft an offensive lineman. Whether that be Troy Fautanu, Graham Barton, Amarius Mimms, or *insert player's name here* if they were to fall. Solidifying the offensive line is of the utmost importance!]\n\nBowers is a unicorn that does things most tight ends simply can not. If McDaniel truly wants to take this offense to the next level, finding a way to land arguably the best tight-end prospect in years would certainly help remedy that.\n\nAs of typing this last night, NFL Network's Peter Schrager has officially mocked Penn State pass-rusher Chop Robinson to the Dolphins via trade down. Why, with the available players on the board, you might ask? I don't have the answer to that. But I do know that if Miami wants to land a potentially game-changing pass-rusher + land an additional day-two pick, Robinson could be that guy.\n\nWhich name do you hope to hear called when the Miami Dolphins make their first-round selection in tonight's NFL Draft? Do you think they draft an offensive or defensive player? What is the Dolphins' most prominent need heading into the 2024 NFL Draft?

At the time, however, the Dolphins also had Mike Tannenbaum as the team's executive vice president of football operations, placing him ahead of Grier in the team's hierarchy. In December 2018, Tannenbaum was reassigned within the organization before quietly leaving the team and paving the way for Grier to take full control of personnel decisions - including control of the team's draft picks.\n\nThe fans scrutinize Grier's selections, with someone somewhere always calling for him to be fired. Grier is the ultimate team player, deferring, for the most part, to the coaching staff to make sure they agree with the players being selected. He understands how to tailor his selections to the coaching staff's schemes and ideal players. Taking a step back to look at the five drafts in which he has had full control, do the results of the draft support the idea that Grier does not know how to make picks?\n\nHere are the picks from each draft, as well as the trades Miami made with the picks they held.\n\n51st: Cam Smith, CB, South Carolina\n\n84th: De'Von Achane, RB, Texas A&M\n\n197th: Elijah Higgins, WR, Stanford\n\n238th: Ryan Hayes, T, Michigan\n\nSmith immediately jumps out as a concern after essentially having a redshirt rookie season. Is he such a bust that the Dolphins could not afford to have him on the field last year? Will that continue into 2024? Or will a change from former defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's system to new coordinator Anthony Weaver be the spark that reignites Smith's career?\n\nAfter Smith, the Dolphins found a gem in Achane. Along with Raheem Mostert, the Dolphins will have a strong one-two punch from the backfield featuring Achane.\n\nHiggins and Hayes were both claimed off waivers when the Dolphins attempted to add them to the practice squad at the end of the preseason. Higgins joined the Arizona Cardinals, while Hayes moved to the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts waived Hayes a few weeks later, and the Dolphins brought him back to Miami as part of the practice squad and then signed him for the 2024 season as well.\n\nOther than Achane, the rookies did not perform much for Miami in 2023, but it is too early to deem any of them a bust. The Dolphins' 2023 Draft is probably more about the veterans they acquired than the selected rookies. Picks from this year were used to acquire wide receiver Tyreek Hill, cornerback Jalen Ramsey, linebacker Bradley Chubb, and running back Jeff Wilson.\n\n102nd: Channing Tindall, LB, Georgia\n\n125th: Erik Ezukanma, WR, Texas Tech\n\n224th: Cameron Goode, OLB, Cal\n\n247th: Skylar Thompson, QB, Kansas State\n\nThe 2022 draft may prove to be a rough one for Miami. The third year in the league is typically when players find themselves and grow into key roles. Will any of this group take that step forward in 2024? The Dolphins' first pick in 2022 was the third-round selection of Tindall, who has struggled to find the consistency that would allow him to contribute to the team's defense. He has played a total of 21 defensive snaps his first two seasons, though he has appeared on special teams for 411 snaps, including being on the field 54 percent of the special teams plays last year. The hopes for contribution on defense from Tindall are still there, but he may prove to be primarily a special teams contributor.\n\nEzukanma is someone many fans hope will breakout. He had flashes in training camp and the preseason in 2022, but has only played in three games with two receptions in his first two seasons. Last year he was limited to two games due to a neck injury. The potential is there, but Ezukanma needs to stay healthy and take a huge step toward reaching his potential on an offense desperate for a third receiver.\n\nGoode spent his rookie season on the Dolphins' practice squad. He began the 2023 season on the practice squad as well but was promoted to the active roster during the season. Injuries seemed to have Goode in position to see an increase in playing time as an edge rusher late in the season and into the playoffs, but he sustained a torn patella tendon in the team's Week 18 game and was moved to injured reserve before the playoff game.\n\nThompson has served as the Dolphins' third-string quarterback since being selected. While he did not see playing time in 2023, during his rookie season in 2022, he appeared in seven games, starting two of them, and started the team's playoff game. He threw for 534 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions on a 57.1 percent completion rate. The Dolphins coaching staff appears to really like Thompson as their developmental quarterback and, unless something dramatic happens during the draft or prior to training camp, he seems set to return as the third quarterback on the roster this year.\n\nThis set of draft picks is dominated by the trade for Hill from the Kansas City Chiefs. Miami did make some trades for other veterans using late-round picks, but the Hill trade was the headliner of the 2022 Draft for the Dolphins.\n\n6th: Jaylen Waddle, WR, Alabama\n\n18th: Jaelan Phillips, OLB, Miami\n\n36th: Jevon Holland, S, Oregon\n\n42nd: Liam Eichenberg, T, Notre Dame\n\n81st: Hunter Long, TE, Boston College\n\n231st: Larnel Coleman, T, UMass\n\n244th: Gerrid Doaks, RB, Cincinnati\n\nThis draft started with the Dolphins moving out of the third-overall position, a spot they held from the Laremy Tunsil trade to the Houston Texans. They traded with the San Francisco 49ers to jump back to the 12th position, then traded that pick to the Philadelphia Eagles for the sixth pick. After the whirlwind of moves, the Dolphins added Waddle. In his three seasons with Miami, he has caught 251 passes for 3,385 yards with 18 touchdowns. His 18.1 yards per reception average in 2022 led the league.\n\nMiami came back on the clock with the 18th pick, using that selection to add Phillips. The edge rusher has recorded 146 tackles in three years, along with 22 sacks, one forced fumble, three fumble recoveries, and an interception. His 2023 season was cut short by an Achilles tear, an injury that may cost him playing time early in the 2024 season.\n\nWith the 36th pick, the Dolphins added another starter to their depth chart with the selection of Holland. In his three years, Holland has recorded 230 tackles, four sacks, 20 passes defensed, five interceptions with a touchdown, four forced fumbles, and three fumble recoveries. While Miami has stated they will be exercising the fifth-year options built into the two first-round picks' contracts, Holland, as a second-round selection, does not have that contract provision. The Dolphins have indicated they plan on working a contract extension with Holland to keep him with the team.\n\nThe 42nd pick led to Miami adding Eichenberg, a player much maligned by the fan base for most of his three years here. A large part of Eichenberg's issues could be from the team using him all over the offensive line, never giving him a chance to learn and develop at one position. When the Dolphins added him to the starting lineup as a right guard last year, he flourished, but had to move back to center as injuries mounted. He has played in 43 games over the three seasons since he was drafted, starting 38 of them.\n\nLong, the 81st pick, spent two seasons with the Dolphins, appearing in seven games as a rookie including two starts, then nine games in his season season. He caught one pass for eight yards with Miami before being traded to the Los Angeles Rams as part of the team's trade for Jalen Ramsey before the 2023 season.\n\nThe pair of seventh-round picks, Coleman and Doaks, both had short stints with Miami. Coleman landed on injured reserve at the end of the preseason as a rookie, then was signed to the team's practice squad at the start of the 2022 season. He was signed off the Dolphins' practice squad by the Carolina Panthers a month later, then was released during the following preseason. In 2023, he played in the XFL, then started 2024 in the UFL but was released and signed by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League.\n\nDoaks spent 2021 on the Dolphins' practice squad before being released at the end of the 2022 preseason. He has bounced on and off the Houston Texans' practice squad throughout the past two seasons and re-signed with the team for 2024.\n\nThe Dolphins were active throughout the draft, moving up and down the draft board. They came out of the draft with three superstar starters and a developing starting offensive lineman.\n\n5th: Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Alabama\n\n18th: Austin Jackson, OT, USC\n\n30th: Noah Igbinoghene, CB, Auburn\n\n39th: Robert Hunt, OT, Louisiana\n\n56th: Raekwon Davis, NT, Alabama\n\n70th: Brandon Jones, S, Texas\n\n111th: Solomon Kindley, G, Georgia\n\n154th: Jason Strowbridge, DE, North Carolina\n\n164th: Curtis Weaver, OLB, Boise State\n\n185th: Blake Ferguson, LS, LSU\n\n246th: Malcolm Perry, WR, Navy\n\nThe 2020 Draft for the Dolphins is all about Tagovailoa, a player who still headlines plenty of debate today. The quarterback was selected to his first Pro Bowl following the 2023 season after leading the league in passing yards. In 2022, he led the league with an 8.9 yards per attempt average and a 105.5 passer rating. Injuries have been a concern for Tagovailoa, ranging back to his college days, but he was able to start all 17 games for Miami last year. He has thrown for 12,639 yards with 81 touchdowns and 37 interceptions in his career, with a 66.9 percent completion rate and a 97.1 passer rating.\n\nHe ranks fourth all-time in passing yards and passing touchdowns for Miami, trailing Dan Marino, Bob Griese, and Ryan Tannehill. He is the franchise leader in career passer rating and he is third in yards per attempt among passers who have thrown at least 100 passes as a Dolphins player.\n\nThe second of Miami's three first-round picks, Jackson established himself as the team's starting right tackle last year, locking down the position despite concerns heading into the season that he could be a bust. During his four seasons with the team, Jackson has appeared in 48 games, starting 46. He missed most of the 2022 season with an ankle injury. Jackson signed a three-year contract extension near the end of the 2023 season.\n\nIgbinoghene became the biggest disappointment in the Dolphins' draft class. Drafted at just 20 years old, the hope was that Igbinoghene would develop into a top-tier, long-term cornerback for Miami. He struggled to find consistency and found himself inactive or limited in playing time on game days. He was traded at the end of the 2023 preseason to the Dallas Cowboys. Igbinoghene appeared in 32 games with Miami, starting five, with 29 tackles, two fumbles recovered, five passes defensed, and one interception. He added five games played with the Cowboys. He signed with the Washington Commanders as a free agent this offseason.\n\nHunt began his career with the Dolphins as a reserve lineman, but moved into the starting lineup as a right tackle during his rookie year. He moved to right guard in 2021, taking over as the starter and locking down the position over three seasons. He appeared in 61 games in his career, starting 55 times. Hunt signed with the Carolina Panthers as a free agent this offseason.\n\nDavis took on the role of nose tackle in Miami's 3-4 defensive scheme, appearing in 63 games with 48 starts in four seasons. He recorded 129 tackles with two sacks over that span and, while never the star like Christian Wilkins next to him, he was a solid piece of the defensive front and allowed Wilkins the freedom to get after the quarterback. Davis signed with the Indianapolis Colts as a free agent this offseason.\n\nMiami seemed to hit a homerun with the 70th pick, especially when they allowed Jones to blitz from his safety position. An injury in 2022 limited him to seven games played, then he seemed to struggle to find consistency in 2023, likely in part as he learned to trust his ACL again and in part because of the change to defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's system. Jones signed with the Denver Broncos in free agency this year.\n\nKindley served as the starting right guard his rookie season, but was surpassed by Hunt in 2021. He was waived by the Dolphins at the end of the preseason in 2022, eventually signing with the New York Giants practice squad during the season, but was released by the team ahead of the 2023 training camp period and is still a free agent. He has appeared in 29 games, starting 15 of them.\n\nStrowbridge appeared in eight games, with three tackles, as a rookie, but fell to Miami's practice squad for the 2021 season. He was released from the practice squad a week into the season and never caught on with another team.\n\nWeaver was waived/injured by the Dolphins during the 2020 preseason, ending a short stint with Miami. He spent time three seasons with the Cleveland Browns, seeing time on the active roster, the practice squad, and injured reserve. He signed with the Minnesota Vikings during the 2023 offseason, but was waived by the team during the preseason. He joined the USFL in 2023, then signed with the CFL this year.\n\nThe Dolphins' 185th pick provided Ferguson, locking down their long snapper position. He has played in all 67 games over his four years in the league and signed a three-year contract extension during the 2023 season.\n\nPerry spent the first half of his rookie year inactive on game day but eventually worked his way into being a contributor for the Dolphins as a wildcat quarterback and rotational wide receiver. Heading into his second season, the Dolphins also began working him as a special teams return option, then attempted to put him on the practice squad at the end of the preseason, but the New England Patriots claimed him off waivers. He landed on injured reserve with a foot injury to start the year, then was released by the Patriots midseason. He signed with the New Orleans Saints practice squad, but was released a few weeks later without making an appearance. He returned to the Patriots but decided to retire from the league before the 2022 training camp period to begin his service in the United States Marine Corps.\n\nThe Dolphins moved around during the draft, but not to the extend we would see in subsequent years. The main moves were using picks from the Minkah Fitzpatrick trade\n\n13th: Christian Wilkins, DE, Clemson\n\n78th: Michael Deiter, G, Wisconsin\n\n151st: Andrew Van Ginkel, LB, Wisconsin\n\n202nd: Isaiah Prince, T, Ohio State\n\n233rd: Chandler Cox, FB, Auburn\n\n234th: Myles Gaskin, RB, Washington\n\nWilkins was a star coming out of Clemson and that continued into his time with Miami. The Dolphins exercised his fifth-year option for the 2023 season. In his five years with the Dolphins, he appeared in 81 games, starting 77, with 355 tackles, 19 passes defensed, one interception, four forced fumbles, six fumble recoveries, and 20.5 sacks. He became the top free agency target this offseason, signing with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nDeiter started at left guard as a rookie for Miami, then became a reserve lineman for his second season. He returned to the starting lineup at center for 2021, but a foot injury cost him most of the season. He worked as a reserve lineman for 2022 before joining the Houston Texans for 2023. He signed with the Washington Commanders this offfseason. He appeared in 57 games, with 23 starts, in his four years with the Dolphins, then added 16 appearances, starting 10 times, with Houston last year.\n\nAt 151, the Dolphins selected Van Ginkel, who worked in multiple linebacker roles with Miami over five seasons. His strength is as a pass rusher, but the Dolphins also had him working as an inside linebacker in 2023, giving the team flexibility in getting him on the field. OVer his five seasons, Van Ginkel established himself as a fan favorite while playing in 73 games, starting 42, with 250 career tackles, 21 passes defensed, two interceptions with a touchdown, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries with a touchdown, and 17 sacks.\n\nPrince spent much of his rookie season as a reserve lineman, appearing in four game with two starts before Miami waived him near the end of the season. The Cincinnati Bengals then was claimed by the Cincinnati Bengals. He opted out of the 2020 season under the league's COVID-19 rules, then spend most of 2022 on injured reserve or the practice squad for Cincinnati. He signed with the Denver Broncos in 2023 but was released near the end of the preseason before spending a month with the Atlanta Falcons. He has appeared in 21 games, with six starts, over his career, including the four games with the Dolphins. He is currently a free agent.\n\nCox appeared in 21 games, starting six, with the Dolphins over two seasons. He recorded two receptions for nine yards in 2020 before being waived near the end of his second season. He never signed with another team.\n\nAs a seventh-round pick, not a lot is expected of a player for his career, but Gaskin broke out from those expectations. He only appeared in seven games as a rookie, carrying the ball 36 times for 133 yards and a touchdown. He moved up the depth chart for the 2002 and 2021 seasons, starting 17 of 27 games played. He only appeared in four games in 2022. Between injuries and the Dolphins' shying away from the running game, Gaskin's carries were never as high as expected from a starting running back, but he recorded 361 attempts for 1,355 yards and seven touchdowns in his four years with Miami. In 2023, after being released by the Dolphins at the end of the preseason, Gaskin bounced back and forth between the Minnesota Vikings' practice squad and active roster before being poached by the Los Angeles Rams during the season. He was waived by the Rams a month later and returned to the Vikings' practice squad. He re-signed with Minnesota for the 2024 season.\n\nMiami was relatively calm during the draft in terms of trades as Chris Grier settled into the first year he was making all the decisions. The main highlights were Ryan Tannehill being traded away and making a trade to acquire Josh Rosen - who had fallen out of favor with the Arizona Cardinals, but never caught on with Miami.", "source":

They must now fill some of them in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nIt's not an ideal situation for general manager Chris Grier and Co. to be in after yet another premature exit in the playoffs.\n\nUnfortunately, Miami only boasts six picks in the 2024 NFL Draft after exhausting selections on trades for key players. The team doesn't have a pick in the third or fourth round of the annual event.\n\nIt's in this that we provide you with our final Miami Dolphins mock draft for 2024 with some analysis included in.\n\nCurrent left tackle Terron Armstead's future is in doubt after several injury issues over the past few seasons. He is coming back for 2024. But we have no idea how long the veteran will hold up after missing 20 games over the course of the past three years.\n\nWe also know that right tackle Austin Jackson is a weak link on the Dolphins' offensive line. Pro Football Focus graded him out at under 70 a season ago.\n\nIf the Dolphins are serious about protecting Tua Tagovailoa and making sure he stays healthy, this must be a focal point. The good news? Our Dolphins mock has them acquiring a value player in Fautanu at a need position. He's projected to be a top-15 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. \"He comes from a good program and he's a really hard-nosed player who can take coaching. Love the makeup,\" NFC national scout to NFL.com.\n\nRelated: 2024 NFL Draft EDGE rankings\n\nMiami is sticking with its 3-4 scheme despite moving on from defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. With respected young defensive mind Anthony Weaver coming into that role this season, we're expecting the Dolphins to target defenders that fit his former Baltimore Ravens unit.\n\nOrhorhoro is just that. The 6-foot-4, 294-pound defensive lineman is a perfect fit to play defensive end in this scheme. He ran a 4.89 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine and is extremely explosive off the snap for someone his size. The former Clemson star was also super productive in college, recording 24 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks in his final three seasons.\n\nRelated: 2024 NFL Draft wide receiver rankings\n\nMultiple areas of concern on the Dolphins' offensive line heading into the 2024 NFL Draft. Isaiah Wynn could be a placeholder at one guard position. But there is a lack of depth and talent across the board when it comes to the interior of Miami's offensive line.\n\nEnter into the equation a player in Zinter who could actually be a Day 1 starter.

Many NFL fans have watched Kevin Costner in \"Draft Day\", and one scene stands out when young rookie GM Jeff Carson watches his board crash in front of him.\n\nWhen that happens, unprepared teams suffer and scramble. This year, there is no reason for Chris Grier to scramble. The biggest decision is which player to take out of the plethora of choices he will have in front of him.\n\nMiami could and probably should consider trading out of 21 and moving back. The pool at 21 is going to be deep for the Dolphins and dropping back as many as 10 picks may not change that. Miami's biggest area of concern is not to get so focused on one player only. Keep their options open.\n\nLooking at this draft realistically and not through the lens of a mock draft, we can logically ascertain that the following players will be off the board by the time the Dolphins select.\n\nCaleb Williams, J.J. McCarthy, Drake May, Marvin Harrison, Jr., Malik Nabers, Jayden Daniels, Joe Alt, Dallas Turner, Brock Bowers, Rome Odunze, Terrion Arnold, and Olumuyiwa Fashanu. Those players account for 12 of the first 21 draft picks. We can also assume that Quinyon Mitchell, J.C. Latham, Amarius Mims, and Taliese Fuaga will all be off the board as well. That brings the total to 16 selections off the board.\n\nThis leaves five draft picks until the Dolphins select at 21. Yes, things happen in the draft, and one of those last four players could slide. There is always a surprise pick in the draft, but if we look at this realistically, with those 16 players off the board, the Dolphins have to wait only for four more players to be selected.\n\nBrian Thomas, Jr., Troy Fautanu, Laiatu Latu, Bryon Murphy, II, Cooper DeJean, Johnny Newton, Graham Barton, Chop Robinson, Tyler Guyton, Jackson Powers-Johnson, Xavier Worthy, Adonai Mitchell, Jordan Morgan, and Nate Wiggins are all still available. They account for, at minimum, the rest of the first round.\n\nThink about this: If the players we listed as being off the board are, in fact, off the board, those players listed as being on the board from pick 17 to pick 31 will be available for the Dolphins either at 21 or later in round one if they trade back.\n\nThis is one of the best scenarios for the Dolphins in any recent draft memory. Miami has needs, but they are not pigeonholed into one position specifically, and as a result, Miami can do a lot with their selection at 21.", "source": {"uri": "phinphanatic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phin Phanatic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_scramble", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback scramble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Grier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Grier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Carson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Carson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Turner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Nabers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malik Nabers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Wiggins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Wiggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laiatu_Latu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laiatu Latu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonai_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adonai Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2950,h_1659,x_0,y_288/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/62/01hwb2tshdjrbsyrzq70.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511646", "eventUri": "eng-9511646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The Miami Dolphins first two picks are numbers twenty-one and fifty-five overall, and by all accounts, the Dolphins could go in any direction with those two picks.\n\nGeneral manager Chris Grier has indicated he wants to go with the best player available in the first round. He's also stated that he does not have twenty-one first-round graded players, which clouds any real estimation of what he might do.\n\nOne of the scenarios that could play out for Grier is the possibility of moving down the draft and allocating some draft picks if he feels he could get the player he wants a couple of spots later.\n\nLong-time NFL reporter Alain Poupart, who works for SI.com Fan Nation Network covering the Dolphins, came out with an article a few days ago that piqued my interest. It detailed teams in recent memory that have moved down the draft from pick twenty-one and what they have received in return.\n\nThe article is titled \"What Could the Dolphins Get for Pick 21?\" It's a quick read, and I recommend it.\n\nThe examples Poupart used basically had the Dolphins going from twenty-one overall to the mid-twenties and getting from a solo third-round pick to possibly a third-round and fourth-round pick in return.\n\nWhen you turn your attention to what players most consensus mock drafts have available, it's not a drop-off at all, and the depth of the trenches on both sides makes this route very enticing if you can flip that into a third-round pick that the Dolphins could use for a fill-in starter or important rotation piece.\n\nOne such scenario was proposed by the five-year reigning draft king himself, Brendan Donahue.\n\nDonahue's latest mock draft has the Dolphins doing what Poupart suggests could be the move in the first round, moving down from twenty-one to twenty-seven. Here's what the Dolphins compensation could look like based on their analytics.\n\n\"The projected trade based on trade value would be picks 27, 104, and 138 for the 21st pick.\"\n\nNumber twenty-seven, with a fourth, and fifth-round pick mixed in, isn't a bad trade, but I doubt Chris Grier would pull the trigger without one of the picks in return being a third-round pick. I also agree with the example of the Cardinals trading up, as they need young, high-end talent and have three third-round picks, so I see Chris Grier finessing at least one of them away in a deal.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins are not dead set on any position or defined route in the NFL draft and will play it by ear as most GMs do on draft day and be a deal maker.\n\nIn the case that he does decide to move down, Poupart's suggested return of compensation based on past draft day deals is something Dolphins fans should consider.", "source": {"uri": "thephinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Phinsider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_sabatino@thephinsider.com", "name": "Nick Sabatino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Grier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Grier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JJiHJcc_BjGKr8RPb6VVuURib8U=/0x57:1148x631/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25416018/IMG_0602.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511646", "eventUri": "eng-9511646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The 2024 NFL Draft begins tonight, kicking off the three-day, seven-round annual selection meeting that will bring 257 college prospects into the league. It is going to be an intense period, with teams moving up and down the draft board, veterans being traded, prospects being debated, and fans cheering or booing every move every team makes. It is a fun three days in the middle of the NFL offseason.\n\nOver the last several weeks, we have taken a look at the mock drafts from around the web to see what people think the Miami Dolphins will do with their first round pick. Throughout mock draft season, there really has never been a consensus with what Miami could do with the 21st pick, either with a specific player or which position Miami might target. Popular picks for the Dolphins have included Duke offensive lineman Graham Barton, Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II, Illinois defensive tackle Jer'Zhan Newton, and Oregon center Jackson Powers-Johnson, but there have been numerous other prospects and positions mocked to Miami.\n\nOur fifth and final edition of the Dolphins mock draft database for 2024 is below. We track when each projection was published/last updated and include any writeup author included.\n\nWhich mock draft do you like the best? Let us know in the comments.\n\nTroy Fautanu, T, Washington\n\nThe offensive tackle run is on, with the Dolphins taking the skilled and versatile blocker who could excel at tackle or guard.\n\nGeorgia's Amarius Mims may be the incoming class' most fascinating prospect since he's clearly a first-round talent with impressive physical traits yet lacks experience.\n\nMims will enter the professional ranks after only eight starts at the collegiate level.\n\n\"The Miami Dolphins provide an excellent situation for the inexperienced Mims to learn and grow into with an outstanding mentor in Terron Armstead to guide him along in his development,\" Thorn said. \"Without immediate pressure to play and maybe the most OL-friendly scheme in football, this is a dream fit for both the team and player.\"\n\nUltimately with the right coaching and development, the 21-year-old prospect can be a dominant force.\n\n(April 10 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon)\n\n(April 1 pick: Dolphins traded out of first round, picking up the 44th and 77th picks, and a 2025 third-round pick, from the Las Vegas Raiders)\n\nJer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois\n\nChristian Wilkins and Raekwon Davis are gone. Johnny Newton is a high motor interior defender that will be able to supply pass rush for that franchise. Early in the year, the team could be without a fully-healthy Jaelen Phillips or Bradley Chubb, which adds emphasis on others to pick up the slack. Andrew Van Ginkel is no longer there to pick up that slack.\n\nThe Dolphins have plenty of needs to address, and this is something of a Best Player Available at one of those needs picks. Mims offers a lot for any team to dream on. The concern is the overall lack of reps during his time at Georgia, but he's a massive human being with incredible athleticism, not just for his size but for anybody.\n\nThey have injury issues with their edge players, so getting one here would be a nice pickup. If Verse fell this far, they would likely race the card to the podium.\n\n(April 17 pick: Jer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois)\n\n(April 2 pick: Amarius Mims, OT, Georgia)\n\nJared Verse, Edge, Florida State\n\nDespite already having Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips -- albeit coming off major injuries -- the Dolphins continue stocking the defensive line with Jared Verse, who is too talented to pass up here.\n\n(April 17 pick: Jared Verse, Edge, Florida State)\n\n(April 2 pick: Troy Fautanu, G, Washington)\n\n(March 18 pick: Troy Fautanu, G, Washington)\n\nProjected trade: Dolphins trade back to the 27th pick, giving the 21st pick to the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nTyler Guyton, T, Oklahoma\n\nThe Dolphins have seen the athletic Austin Jackson blossom under Mike McDaniel and view Guyton in a similar light, a big, long, physical specimen who needs proper coaching to reach his monstrous potential. GM Chris Grier secures a third-round pick (No. 90) from Arizona along with the rights to this pick. Solid.\n\n(April 17 pick: Olumuyiwa Fashanu, OT, Penn State)\n\n(April 4 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon)\n\n(March 26 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon)\n\nGraham Barton, C/G, Duke\n\nBarton played left tackle at Duke but his NFL future will be inside at either guard or center.\n\n(April 17 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon)\n\n(April 2 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon)\n\n(March 19 pick: Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia)\n\nMiami signed center Aaron Brewer in free agency but could use an upgrade at guard. Barton, who played center and left tackle at Duke, would slide in as a Day 1 starter next to Brewer. The beauty of this selection is that Barton's versatility and experience mean he could still play tackle if Terron Armstead -- who has dealt with injuries in recent years and played in just 10 games last season -- were to miss time in 2024.\n\nXavier Worthy, WR, Texas\n\nThe Dolphins certainly don't need to add another wide receiver, but is there a more tantalizing potential fit than the fastest player in the history of the combine (4.21 seconds in the 40-yard dash) joining the fastest offense in the NFL? Miami's need for speed is well established, and this pick would create an incredible receiver trio with Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and Worthy.\n\nLaiatu Latu, Edge, UCLA\n\n(April 15 pick: Byron Murphy II, DT, Texas)\n\n(April 8 pick: Jer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois)\n\nBrian Thomas, WR, LSU\n\nIt may be hard for the Dolphins to pass on a pass rusher like Laiatu Latu, but looking at the other quarterbacks taking snaps in the AFC, Chris Grier and Mike McDaniel might view this as an \"arms race\" selection -- and it could truly make Miami the fastest team in the history of football.\n\n(April 2 pick: Chop Robinson, OLB, Penn State)\n\n(March 4 pick: Chop Robinson, OLB, Penn State)\n\nProjected trade: Dolphins send 21 and 184 to Arizona Cardinals for 27 and 71.\n\nTyler Guyton, T, Oklahoma\n\nThe Dolphins went volume-shooting on the free agent iOL market, signing Aaron Brewer to start at center while re-signing Isaiah Wynn and adding Jack Driscoll to compete at guard.\n\nWith their interior somewhat sorted out, Miami could focus on finding a long-term replacement for left tackle Terron Armstead, who's missed 20 games over the last three years and flirted with retirement over the offseason.\n\nTyler Guyton might need work with Dolphins OL coach Butch Barry, but he's already shown solid development as a pass protector. While he only played right tackle at Oklahoma, the 6'7'', 328-pound Guyton has the athletic traits to play on the left side.\n\nI love the Dolphins as an offensive line team early in the draft. They have both the short-term need following the departures of Connor Williams and Robert Hunt, as well as the long-term need at left tackle, where Terron Armstead is in the twilight of his career. Fautanu can find a starting role early at guard, which might be his best NFL position, and then consider a bump to left tackle when Armstead hangs 'em up. Think Tyler Smith with the Cowboys.\n\nJared Verse, Edge, Florida State\n\nWith the Dolphins only having six picks in the draft and none in the 3rd or 4th rounds, they can recoup some picks by moving down six spots and still address a major need along their defensive line with the loss of Christian Wilkins via free agency.\n\nDefensive tackle is quickly becoming one of the highest-paid positions in the NFL.\n\n(April 16 pick: Jer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois) after trade with Cardinals to move to 27)\\\n\nJared Verse, Edge, Florida State\n\nThe Dolphins, like the Rams, will also be thinking about defensive tackle disruption after losing Christian Wilkins in free agency to the Raiders, but they could also use a third key pass rusher with youthful burst to replace Andrew Van Ginkel behind Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb.\n\nSecond round (55): Dadrion Taylor-Demerson, S, Texas Tech\n\nThe Dolphins could use a key secondary chess piece to potentially help as a nickel corner and also be a contingency for 32-year-old newcomer Jordan Poyer.\n\n(April 18 pick: Byron Murphy II, DT, Texas; Second round: T'Vondre Sweat, DT, Texas)\n\n(April 2 pick: Byron Murphy II, DT, Texas; Second round: T'Vondre Sweat, DT, Texas)\n\n(March 19 pick: Byron Murphy II, DT, Texas)\n\nThis has been a really popular landing spot for Duke offensive lineman Graham Barton, but the value of Verse outside of the top 20 is tremendous. With both Jaelen Phillips and Bradley Chubb coming off of significant season-ending injuries, there's a clear fit here.\n\nAgile physically and mentally, Barton moves from college left tackle to NFL center (he did start five games at the pivot early in his Duke days) and anchors Mike McDaniel's lightning-speed offensive attack.\n\nJer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois\n\nThe Dolphins can't adequately replace Christian Wilkins in 2024, but Newton is an excellent prospect who will have an immediate impact.\n\nYes, they're already paying Bradley Chubb and soon will have to pay Jaelan Phillips. As we learned last year, though, you can never have too many pass rushers. And there's a drop-off in talent at the position after Chop.\n\nIt's intriguing to mock a wide receiver to the Dolphins' offense, but their needs in the trenches outweigh the potential excitement of a receiver. This class is deep at that position, allowing them to wait until later.\n\nGetting a player like Byron Murphy II helps this defense tremendously. Losing Christian Wilkins hurt, but it was a necessary move. Adding Murphy gives them an explosive player who could potentially replace Wilkins by himself and helps a defense with a big hole at the tackle position.\n\nThe Dolphins look to the edge spot by grabbing Turner here, dropping a highly athletic and long-levered pass rusher into their rotation. Alongside Jaelan Phillips, Bradley Chubb, and the newly signed Shaq Barrett, Turner can give the team more juice up front -- and will provide the type of depth it needs on the defensive line.\n\nJer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois\n\nThe Dolphins still have a need at defensive tackle after losing Christian Wilkins in free agency. This would be a great get for the Dolphins. Newton is a high-floor, polished player who should immediately be a disruptive presence for the Dolphins. It would also get them a cost-controlled contract at a position of need for now and the future.\n\nSure, the Dolphins signed seven defensive tackles this offseason after losing Christian Wilkins in free agency, but they all won't make the roster. Newton gives Miami a running mate for Zach Sieler on the defensive line, and he can create interior pressure and defend against the run. Graham Barton was tempting here, but the Dolphins can still address offensive guard in the second round.\n\nJared Verse, Edge, Florida State\n\nThe Dolphins finished third in the NFL in sacks last season, but with Christian Wilkins hitting it big with the Raiders in free agency, reinforcements up front are needed. With the top defensive tackles off the board, the Dolphins change their tune slightly with Verse, the most well-rounded defensive end in the draft.\n\nBeefing up the line could help the Dolphins upgrade an offense that struggled against physical defensive fronts last season.\n\nGraham Barton, C/G, Duke\n\nWhile I think the Dolphins could be trade-down candidates, I expect them to take their favorite offensive lineman here. Graham Barton has experience at center, tackle, and guard, where I expect him to play in the NFL. His mobility would serve him well in Mike McDaniel's offense.\n\nSecond round (55): Malachi Corley, WR, Western Kentucky\n\n(April 15 pick: Troy Fautanu, OL, Washington; Second round: Ladd McConkey, WR, Georgia)\n\n(April 8 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon; Second round: Troy Franklin, WR, Oregon)\n\nBrian Thomas, WR, LSU\n\nThe Dolphins will certainly be getting calls to trade back here. But there are two reasons I think Miami will stay and take Brian Thomas. One: Thomas is one of the last players left in the draft with a true first-round grade. Two: Well, he's fast as hell. While Texas wide receiver Xavier Worthy had the fastest 40-yard-dash time ever, Thomas was only one-tenth of a second slower even though he's 45 pounds heavier (imagine Worthy running with a 45-pound barbell and still recording a 4.3). In fact, Thomas was *faster* in the final 20 yards of his 40 than Worthy was. Mike McDaniel's whole thing last year was getting guys to their top speed with pre-snap motion. I doubt that McDaniel will want to give Thomas up if he falls to them.\n\nThe Dolphins lost plenty of edge-rushing talent this offseason. Meanwhile, Christian Wilkins departed for Las Vegas. They'll need to find someone else who can hound Josh Allen and Aaron Rodgers.\n\nDallas Turner is a dynamic pass-rushing threat with immense upside who has drawn comparisons to Brian Burns. However, some teams have flagged him medically, so he could be in for a draft-day slide.\n\nSecond round (55): Brandon Fiske, DT, Florida State\n\n(April 15 pick: Laiatu Latu, Edge, UCLA; Second round: Juluan Pearl, OT, Illinois)\n\n(April 7 pick: Laiatu Latu, Edge, UCLA; Second round: Juluan Pearl, OT, Illinois)\n\nAmarius Mims, T, Georgia\n\nTerron Armstead will return for the 2024 season, but Miami could start planning ahead at offensive tackle, especially because it lost key players off the O-line in free agency. Mims arguably has the most upside of any offensive tackle in this class. The problem is he has only eight starts to his name, so the sample is small. Even so, Mims' movement skills, lower-body quickness and power are all off the charts. Ability isn't the question; it's durability. If Mims is able to stay healthy, he's more than capable of playing on the left side in the NFL and giving the Dolphins a successor to Armstead.\n\nOlumuyiwa Fashanu, T, Penn State\n\nThis was a shade lower than I imagined Fashanu going, but the Dolphins won't complain. We can assume they'll want to find Terron Armstead's possible replacement. Could Fashanu -- who played left tackle exclusively in college -- kick inside if needed? Maybe. But the talent would be too enticing to pass on here either way, I suspect.\n\nJer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois\n\nLike some other teams picking in the 20s, the Miami Dolphins' board got hit hard before they chose in this 2024 NFL Mock Draft.\n\nJohnny Newton, who is widely believed in scouting circles to be just one of two interior defensive linemen to go off the board in Round 1, is the best player on the board for Miami, who needs to replace veteran DT Christian Wilkins.\n\nA left tackle for the Blue Devils, the two-time All-ACC selection is likely headed inside in the NFL due to his relatively short arms. And the Fins could use help there after losing Connor Williams, apparently, and Robert Hunt during free agency.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins add Alabama OT JC Latham into the fold up front, an intriguing tackle whom they may not have believed would be available. This is a steal at a position of need for the Dolphins and a great landing spot for Latham.\n\n(April 14 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon)\n\n(April 7 pick: Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon)\n\nOlumuyiwa Fashanu, T, Penn State\n\nIf there's a run on quarterbacks and receivers with the first 20 selections, one of the top offensive tackles could still be available for Miami at No. 21. Fashanu is similar to Christian Darrisaw (No. 23 overall in 2021) and Andre Dillard (No. 22 in 2019) when they were entering the league in that he's a bit raw in his technique and did not dominate in his final collegiate season as expected. Fashanu has the upside, though, to become an excellent starter.\n\nThe Dolphins are eventually going to have some difficult decisions to make at wide receiver when it comes to those contracts. May as well get prepared for that now with nabbing the fastest receiver in the draft.\n\nChop Robinson, Edge, Penn State\n\nThe need for depth off the edge was never more clear than late last year for the Dolphins, who may need some help while Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips work their way back.\n\nDolphins general manager Chris Grier is less likely than most to make a draft day trade, and there isn't much need to when one of the top two interior defenders falls to them at 21. Miami lost two of their top three interior defenders in Christian Wilkins and Raekwon Davis. The Dolphins brought in three veterans to help replace them, but all three are role players who had PFF defensive grades under 60 last season.\n\nXavier Worthy, WR, Texas\n\nMike McDaniel can't help himself here with Xavier Worthy. The Miami Dolphins need to add a No. 3 receiver, and Worthy fits the bill. Plus, this pick gives the team some insurance if it cannot re-sign Jaylen Waddle in a few years.\n\nSecond Round (55): Ruke Orhorhoro, DT, Clemson\n\nFifth Round (158): Joe Milton III, QB, Tennesee\n\nSixth Round (184): Tyrice Night, LB, UTEP\n\nSixth Round (198): Eric Watts, EDGE, Connecticut\n\nSeventh Round (241): Fabien Lovett, DT, Florida State\n\nI would have gone with Barton if he were available, but Verse is a stellar backup plan for Miami. He is a balanced pass-rusher who can set the edge in the run game.\n\nNote: Kiper's solo mock draft is also included in the database, but separated from this joint projection.\n\nGraham Barton, C/G, Duke\n\nGraham Barton is projected all over the line at the next level. A left tackle at Duke, most expect him to move inside to guard, or even to center, with some believing he can stay outside. For Miami, he is an immediate starter at guard and should upgrade a line that is still a weakness on paper.\n\nGraham Barton, C/G, Duke\n\nThere's an argument to be made that the Miami Dolphins need either a starter or depth piece at every single offensive line spot. Luckily for them, Graham Barton exists. A standout left tackle with the Duke Blue Devils, Barton's powerful profile could see him transition inside at the next level. Players who could conceivably man all five spots on the line are a rare commodity.\n\nSecond Round (55): Caelen Carson, CB, Wake Forest - The Dolphins' main focus will be on the offensive line, but adding more depth at CB is important. We saw last year how they struggled for depth in their defensive backfield, and Caelen Carson improves that. This is not a pick that will excite Dolphins fans, but it is a savvy addition.\n\nFifth Round (158): Zak Zinter, OG, Michigan\n\nSixth Round (184): Myles Harden, CB, South Dakota\n\nSixth Round (198): Tarheeb Still, CB, Maryland\n\nSeventh Round (241): Austin Reed, QB, Western Kentucky\n\nGraham Barton, C, Duke\n\nPer usual, protecting Tua Tagovailoa has to be a top priority for the Dolphins this offseason. Tua posted elite efficiency numbers in 2023 but still didn't look comfortable out of structure. The best way to avoid that is to bolster his line, preventing the structure from breaking down in the first place. Barton started his collegiate career as a center but quickly moved to and found success at tackle. If the draft breaks this way, the Dolphins could draft Barton as a center and deploy free agent addition Aaron Brewer at either guard spot.\n\nJer'Zhan Newton, DT, Illinois\n\nFree-agent departure Christian Wilkins leaves enormous shoes to fill in Miami, especially considering his rare endurance for a DT, having logged more than 80 percent of the Dolphins' defensive snaps in each of the past two seasons. In related news, Newton barely came off the field over his last two spectacular seasons at Illinois.\n\nJared Verse, Edge, Florida State\n\nYes, Miami has Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips as its top edge rushers, but both are coming off serious season-ending injuries. Phillips tore an Achilles in late November, while Chubb tore an ACL in early January. There's no guarantee either is 100 percent healthy when training camp starts. That's why the Dolphins could take Verse, who has impressive power in his 254-pound frame. His 50 QB pressures last season were the eighth most in the FBS. Miami has to replace a few starters after offseason subtractions, but Verse would be a no-brainer selection if he's still on the board.\n\nSecond Round (55): Christian Haynes, G, UConn - Miami has faced some upheaval along the offensive line this offseason, creating a hole at guard. The Dolphins ranked 31st in pass block win rate (49.2%), so change could be good. Haynes started 49 games at right guard in college, and he allowed just one sack over his final three seasons. He's my No. 3-ranked player at the position.\n\nIf the medicals check out, this seems like a no-brainer. Latu is a straight-up technician off the edge. And with the uncertainty around when Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips will be fully healthy following their season-ending injuries, the former Bruin fills a need, as well.\n\nAmarius Mims, OT, Georgia\n\nAmarius Mims moves better than any offensive lineman in the draft. With Miami's creativity on offense, they need athletic offensive linemen like Mims to help their system run at maximum efficiency. His size and speed make him a perfect fit for the Dolphins' offense.\n\nIf the board falls like this, Miami can replace Christian Wilkins, who it had to let walk in free agency, with one of the best two IDL in the draft class. If Newton/Murphy are gone, which is strongly possible, the Dolphins may have to force drafting an interior offensive lineman here. Instead, they get Newton to be a defensive front seven cornerstone.\n\nYou guys lost Christian Wilkins, and then -- like a jilted lover going on a shopping spree -- you ended up signing like 30 defensive tackles. You actually did a nice job of filling holes in free agency, so no need is extremely pressing. Some enticing tackles remain available, but I'd opt for Barton, who can play inside and perhaps be an immediate starter.\n\nByron Murphy II, DT, Texas\n\nAfter losing Christian Wilkins in free agency, the Dolphins should try to find another defensive tackle early in this draft. Murphy was the best pass-rushing interior defensive lineman college football had to offer in 2023, leading all FBS defensive tackles in pass-rushing grade (91.5), pass-rush win rate (20.5%) and pressure rate (17%).\n\nJC Latham, OT, Alabama\n\nThe offensive line has been a pain spot for the Dolphins, and JC Latham is the remedy. He can start on the interior to begin his career and move to left tackle when Terron Armstead misses his obligatory several games a year. Latham didn't allow a sack at Alabama and packs a punch in the running game.\n\nByron Murphy II, DT, Texas\n\nThe Dolphins find a replacement for Christian Wilkins (now in Las Vegas) in this explosive defensive tackle out of Texas. He is quite disruptive, generating negative plays on a routine basis. He'll wreak havoc while the rest of the defensive front gets healthy.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins should be expected to draft an interior offensive or defensive lineman with this pick, and in this 2024 NFL Mock Draft, they go with DT Byron Murphy II from Texas.\n\nAfter Christian Wilkins' departure in free agency, the Dolphins have a massive hole at defensive tackle, and their pass rush was already a question mark for 2024 with Jaelan Phillips recovering from a torn Achilles and Bradley Chubb on the mend from a torn ACL.\n\nJackson Powers-Johnson, C, Oregon\n\nThe Dolphins are currently -165 to take an offensive lineman on DraftKings, and since they have their tackle situation sorted out, they go with the best interior lineman on the board. Powers-Johnson can play either guard position or slide inside to center if new signing Aaron Brewer misses any time.", "source": {"uri": "thephinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The former Carolina Panthers beat writer for the Charlotte Observer won the APSE award for breaking news and the South Carolina Press Association award for enterprise writing in 2018.\n\nMonths of speculation, scouting and negotiating all culminate beginning Thursday. For the Miami Dolphins, that means, presumably, making their first pick in the first round since 2021.\n\nOver the past two years, draft weekend has not been a particularly busy time for general manager Chris Grier; the Dolphins have made just eight combined picks in the past two drafts, three of them coming in the second and third rounds. This year, Miami owns selections in the first, second, fifth, sixth and seventh rounds. With a roster that will only get more expensive in the coming years, it's critical Grier finds impact players in this draft.\n\nMiami parted ways with several contributors from a season ago and, for the most part, addressed those areas in free agency. But some burning questions do remain as the 21st overall pick approaches.\n\nGrier said last week that the Dolphins are in position to take the best player available when their first selection arrives. That could be a player at a number of different positions; if recent mock drafts are to be believed, some of those positions align with Miami's team needs.\n\nThe most glaring hole on this roster is at right guard, where the Dolphins have not replaced Robert Hunt. Duke offensive lineman Graham Barton could slot in as a day one starter, but so could Illinois defensive tackle Jer'Zhan Newton.\n\nThe Dolphins have taken a strength in numbers approach to replacing Christian Wilkins, signing seven defensive tackles since the start of free agency. However, none of them project as a long-term option at the position. Miami's activity also isn't an indicator of its thoughts on this year's defensive tackle class.\n\n\"I think it was more just the availability and for us, people wanted to come play here,\" Grier said. \"They know nothing has been promised to any of them, and that's the exciting part. They all know they're coming in to compete. I just think it was the opportunity to add guys that we thought are quality players that had good upsides.\"\n\nMiami also has a looming need at offensive tackle, with this season expected to be Terron Armstead's last. Any tackle they select in the first round would not need to start right away, although considering Armstead's recent injury, the opportunity for playing time as a rookie seems likely. Washington's Troy Fautanu and Georgia's Amarius Mims would be potential options if Grier goes that route, although Barton did play tackle in college.\n\nThen, there's the areas that might not be considered a glaring need but could certainly stand to improve. Dolphins edge rushers Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips suffered season-ending injuries in 2023, although both are expected to play this season. Depth behind them is thin, even after signing veteran Shaquil Barrett. If Florida State's Jared Verse is available, he is a tempting option.\n\nSelecting a pass-rusher would mean the Dolphins invested three first-round picks on their pass-rushers, which will prove to be expensive once it's time to offer extensions. The same logic applies to the wide receiver position, where the Dolphins lack a reliable third option behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. This receiver class is deep, however, and taking one in the first round would be somewhat of a luxury.\n\nSo several positions make sense for Miami at No. 21 ... if they keep the pick.\n\nMiami owns the 21st and 55th overall selections in this draft, but it does not own any picks in the third or fourth rounds. Grier said his staff has not necessarily given 21 first-round grades to this class, and if the players they deem first-round worthy are gone by the time they are on the clock, trading down to recoup some draft capital is an option he will consider. Conversely, if multiple players they like are available at No. 21, trading down once again becomes a realistic path for the Dolphins.\n\nConsidering Miami's lack of draft capital, trading up in the first round does not seem likely. But Grier has a positive track record of finding talent in the middle rounds, and can address depth issues at safety, cornerback, offensive line and/or wide receiver if he decides to trade into the third and fourth rounds.\n\nTua Tagovailoa turned in a career-best season in 2023, playing all 17 regular season games for the first time in his career, and Miami's playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs. He was named a Pro Bowl starter for his efforts. He is also entering the final year of his rookie contract, although both sides are working toward getting an extension done.\n\nGrier was blunt when asked in a pre-draft news conference if the Dolphins would draft a quarterback in the first round.\n\n\"Listen, we always look at every position. I would say that's not somewhere I'm looking at in the first round,\" he said. \"It's not a position that we've even talked about. There are some good players, but we're very happy with Tua and where he is with us.\"\n\nHowever, it's not completely off the board that Miami drafts a quarterback in the later rounds.\n\nMike White and Skylar Thompson currently back up Tagovailoa, but Grier shouldn't shy away from adding competition to the room if he believes he's getting good value.\n\n\"I wouldn't say we're not going to draft a quarterback at any point,\" Grier said. \"We took Skylar here in the seventh round years ago. You always look at opportunities for where you can add depth in your roster, so I just think that goes across the board for any position.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Tonight, the first round kicks off, and if Chris Grier and company have prepared for this moment properly, the player selected by the Dolphins could have an impact on the future of the franchise for many years to come.\n\nOne of the media members most closely connected to Miami's head coach Mike McDaniel is Peter Schrager of Good Morning Football and the NFL Network. The two men have had a positive relationship for years, so when Schrager says something of interest about the Dolphins, it is worth taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Schrager dropped his final mock draft of the season, and he once again has Miami selecting an EDGE defender (he selected Jared Verse out of Florida State in his first mock) -- this time after a trade down with the Detroit Lions.\n\nIn this exercise, the Dolphins traded back from #21 to #29 with the Lions -- acquiring a third round pick (#73 overall) to do so.\n\nWith pick #29, the Dolphins selected EDGE defender from Penn State, Chop Robinson.\n\nHere's what Schrager had to say about the selection:\n\n\"Yes, they're already paying Bradley Chubb and soon will have to pay Jaelan Phillips. As we learned last year, though, you can never have too many pass rushers. And there's a drop-off in talent at the position after Chop.\"\n\nRobinson's talent is still very raw, as his college production would indicate. Through three years in college -- one with the University of Maryland and two with Penn State University -- Chop only totaled 43 tackles and 11.5 sacks. However, once developed, his athleticism could allow him to develop into one of the most explosive pass rushers in the NFL.\n\nSchrager has now selected an EDGE defender for the Dolphins in both of his mock drafts, so fans of the squad clad in aqua and orange should probably take that as an indication that Miami is looking at that position hard and a new pass rusher could be headed to South Florida tonight.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me when going over the final mock from the GMFB figurehead is the players who were selected between picks #21 and #29 -- the players who Miami could have selected by forgoing the trade back scenario.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer either of these four over Chop Robinson plus a third round pick, but I'd understand the Dolphins wanting to acquire more ammunition in what is being called a very deep class.\n\nFor Peter Schrager's full mock with explanations for each selection, click here.\n\nSoon, very soon, all of the speculation will come to an end and we will find out what Miami's plan was all along when the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft kicks off tonight at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT).", "source": {"uri": "thephinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Phinsider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marek_brave@thephinsider.com", "name": "Marek Brave", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McDaniel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike McDaniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaelan_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaelan Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schrager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schrager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland, College Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wDxPFQ86GpW7uBavkp4axUeeCSg=/0x604:7240x4224/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25417389/usa_today_22656228.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511646", "eventUri": "eng-9511646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

That's not at all unusual in a league where teams closely guard information for competitive reasons.\n\nBut we, and others, have uncovered several of them.\n\nHere are the confirmed players who were invited by the Dolphins for 30 visits -- they're called '30' visits because teams can bring in as many as 30 non-local draft prospects for visits -- and what to read into all of it (and keep in mind that at least one was unable to visit because of a scheduling conflict):\n\n1. Defensive backs Callen Bullock (a Southern Cal safety), Qwantez Stiggers (a CFL cornerback), Jarrian Jones (an FSU cornerback), Chig Anusiem (a Colorado State cornerback) and Sanoussi Kane (a Purdue safety).\n\nBullock had nine interceptions the past three seasons and two returned for touchdowns. He's a projected second- or third-round pick.\n\nJones, who picked off Tyler Van Dyke to end UM's final drive against FSU last November, allowed just a 27 passer rating in his coverage area last season (fourth-best among FBS corners). He's a projected mid-round pick, and his ability to line up in the slot makes him appealing.\n\nAnusiem and Kane are considered Day 3 picks or priority free agents. Stiggers, who didn't play high school football but stood out as a CFL rookie last year, has drawn lots of attention and could go in the middle rounds.\n\nWhat to read into it: The Dolphins aren't going to simply hand Kader Kohou the nickel corner job after a disappointing second season. Jones, a very good slot corner, is one of several nickel corners on Miami's radar. Nik Needham and Cam Smith also will compete for that job.\n\nThe Dolphins have looked closely at several second-round safeties, knowing they need a No. 3 and a potential starter to develop behind Jordan Poyer and Jevon Holland. Utah's Cole Bishop also has drawn Miami's interest. It won't be surprising if a safety is one of the Dolphins' six draft picks, and two or three likely will be added after the draft.\n\n2. Potential first-round offensive linemen Jackson Powers-Johnson and Tyler Guyton (the Oklahoma tackle) and potential third-day pick Elijah Klein, a UTEP guard.\n\nOne thing they have in common: Exceptional pass protection skills. Powers-Johnson didn't allow a sack (and just one hurry) in 497 pass blocking snaps last season, which is extraordinary. Guyton - who can play left and right tackle - allowed one sack in 511 career pass blocking snaps, mostly at right tackle.\n\nA schedule conflict kept Klein from visiting.\n\nWhat to read into it: Though defensive tackle and edge rusher might be a greater need, the Dolphins are considering offensive line help at 21.\n\nGuyton would give them a potential heir apparent to Terron Armstead, who has no guaranteed money due after 2024. So would Georgia's Amarius Mims, another player on Miami's radar. Whether Mims visited Miami is unknown; that has been closely guarded.\n\n3. Running backs Marshall's Rasheen Ali (who scored an NCAA-high 25 touchdowns in 2021 and has been timed at nearly 22 mph on some runs) and Louisville running back Isaac Guerendo, who averaged 6.1 yards per carry on 132 attempts last season.\n\nESPN's Louis Riddick lists Guerendo as one of his five draft sleepers: \"At 6-foot, 221 pounds, he has the skills to be a three-down back. Has game-breaking top-end speed.\"\n\nWhat to read into it: Though the Dolphins can return with the exact same running back room that ended last season, they're open to finding competition for Salvon Ahmed (who's coming off a foot injury that needs more time to mend) and Chris Brooks.\n\n4). Kansas edge player Austin Booker.\n\nBooker, who's 6-4 and 240 pounds, appeared in just six games in two seasons for Minnesota before transferring to Kansas, where he blossomed last season. He had 56 tackles (including 12 for loss) and eight sacks for the Jayhawks. NFL.com's Lance Zierlein calls him a \"gifted edge rusher with monster traits.\"\n\nWhat to read into it: Nobody should be surprised if the Dolphins take an edge rusher at 21 (FSU's Jared Verse perhaps) or 55 to supplement Jaelan Phillips, Bradley Chubb and Shaq Barrett.\n\nThe Dolphins have spent a lot of time on more than two dozen edge rushers, and I suspect Booker isn't the only one who took a '30' visit to Miami.\n\n5). Washington receiver Jalen McMillan and Tennessee receiver RaMel Keyton.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. mocks the 6-1 McMillan 51st --- four slots before Miami picks. \"He's a dynamic slot receiver,\" Kiper said.\n\nInjuries limited McMillan a bit last season; he caught 45 passes for 559 yards (12.4 average) and five touchdowns. In 2022, he caught 79 for 1,098 (a 13.9 average) and nine TDs.\n\nKeyton is a projected third day pick who had 66 receptions for 1204 yards and 11 touchdowns over the past two seasons.\n\nWhat to read into it: The Dolphins want to add a highly-skilled No. 3 receiver, whether it's at No. 21 or No. 55 or whether it's eventually coming to terms with a pedigreed veteran (Odell Beckham Jr., Tyler Boyd, perhaps DJ Chark). But Miami has been reluctant to pay much for a No. 3 receiver, leading to an impasse with Beckham.\n\nIf Miami takes a receiver at 21, LSU's Brian Thomas Jr. and Texas' Xavier Worthy would be in play. There are about 10 receivers - including McMillan and UF's Ricky Pearsall - who could be in play at 55, if available.\n\n6). Among other 30 visits: Northern Iowa defensive tackle Khristian Boyd and Iowa tight end Erick All.\n\nWhat to read it into: The Dolphins need another highly skilled defensive tackle, and they've zoned in on a handful, including Boyd and LSU's Maason Smith, who was worked out privately by Dolphins defensive line coach Austin Clark on the Tigers' campus.\n\nESPN's Field Yates has Smith going 42nd - 13 picks before Miami's second round pick - and notes \"he has the raw tools to become a disruptor as both a pass-rusher and a run-defender.\"\n\nAnd though Miami seems set at tight end, they've been spending a lot of time at the position. Mike McDaniel and tight ends coach Jon Embree spent considerable time in Austin, Texas, with Longhorns tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders, who's projected for Miami's range at 55.\n\nHalf of the Dolphins' maximum potential 30 visits were never identified publicly, and like many teams, the Dolphins never share or confirm 30 visitors.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Dolphins traded their fourth-round pick in this draft to Denver as part of a trade that brought pass rusher Bradley Chubb to Miami.\n\nThe 49ers had their designated fourth-round selection, pick No. 131 overall, moved to the end of the round and will forfeit a fifth-round pick in the 2025 draft after the league discovered administrative payroll accounting errors that resulted in a misreporting of their cumulative player compensation.

There are 32 picks in the first round on Thursday. The Miami Dolphins will have a first-round pick (21) for the first time in three years.\n\nThe next two rounds take place on Friday. The Dolphins have a 2nd round pick. The Dolphins will have four more picks on Saturday, for a total of six picks.\n\nGeneral Manager Chris Grier spoke to CBS Miami's Steve Goldstein about what it's like during the draft.\n\nGoldstein: \"What is the morning and the whole day like for you and your staff on day one of the draft?\n\nGrier: \"Yeah, for the staff, it's kind of a quiet day, you know, for myself, it's, you may get a call here or there. And it's just, again, like everyone is just trying to find out rumors and what's going on around the league. Whether it's, you know, agents or someone reaching out to you about what they've heard, but it's for the most part a quiet day, unless a team or us or someone's getting aggressive of trying to make a deal. But for the most part, it'll be pretty quiet till probably six, six o'clock or so, then you may get a couple more calls. And then, but I would say it's a low stress day really.\"\n\nGoldstein: \"Do you get a lot of sleep the night before?\"\n\nGrier: \"I do, I do, because I'm confident in the work we've done. So it's not one of those, I'm not panicked or nervous about anything, as well as our staff, we all feel good. We're always excited for whatever that day brings.\"\n\nGoldstein: \"At heart, you're a scout, you're a personnel guy, you're a player guy. What is it? Like when you make that phone call and, you know, you're giving a young person, really the opportunity of a lifetime, and you tell them they're a Miami Dolphin.\"\n\nGrier: \"It's pretty, it's very exciting. And it's rewarding because you understand that the work we put in on that person and that player, we feel good, and he understands that we're showing our belief in him. Just to hear the joy in the rooms and stuff light up, you know, and just the excitement and it's pretty cool. I've been on the phone a few times the guys crying, you know, they're just overcome with joy. So just knowing that you're changing someone's life, but they're also excited to live their dream to come here and who wouldn't want to play in Miami?\"\n\nGoldstein: \"Is there one conversation that you kind of remember over the years?\"\n\nGrier: \"Years ago, and this is when I was a college director, I'm not going to say the player, who he was, but I called the player. So we're like, 'Hey, you're going to be a Miami Dolphin'. And he's like 'Miami Dolphins' and you hear a guy in his background (say) Miami Dolphins, they have Zach Thomas, you're never going to play'. And he's like shut up. They're like fighting on the phone. His family members were like mad he's coming to us because Zach Thomas is here. And so it was hysterical. So there have been some very memorable ones. But that one has always stood out over the years.\"\n\nGoldstein: \"That's funny. So we have the position. We don't have the name but we have the position. Your dad, Bobby, when agents speak about somebody the way they talk about him, the reputation, the class person that is your brother, (who is) a general manager in the NHL and hockey for the San Jose Sharks, how much has that family camaraderie and upbringing helped you in your job?\"\n\nGrier: My mom and dad deserve all the credit. You know, my mom was there with us when dad was working all those long hours. And then as I got older, I got to be around dad and then started with you know with him and Coach (Bill) Parcells in New England and just seeing how he worked and conducted business and handled himself, that's always been the most rewarding thing. Like you said, I've had more people come up to me, just always asking how my dad is doing, and then agents, you know, just over the years all saying like, 'Hey, your dad was one of the nicest people to me when I was getting started'. So, you know, I try and do the same. I try and live up to his name and his standard and, and so I think my brother and I both do. We've learned so much from him. I still talk to him. We still talk football, he called last night and talked about a couple of players he liked and a couple he didn't like. So it's always good to have him as a resource to bounce back off and talk football with him.\"\n\nGoldstein: \"Finally, Chris, you've been around these drafts for a long time. It's now, you know, goes city to city, Kansas City last year, Detroit this year. It's three days. Has that changed? From a management standpoint, with everything that's out there and just the big spectacle that the draft has become, is it still (about) evaluating players?\"\n\nGrier: \"I think for us, it's still evaluating players. All the other stuff is shallow and fluff. You know, it always comes down to you know, our ability to make the right selection for the Miami Dolphins.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Grier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Grier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFOR-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WFOR-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Jose Sharks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/25/73d690e6-f610-43f5-91f7-0d04d952c59d/thumbnail/1200x630/43109272930677db98245a44eec71999/dolphins-gm-chris-grier.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511646", "eventUri": "eng-9511646", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The Miami Dolphins are scheduled to pick 21st overall.\n\nLooking back at draft grades from media outlets in recent years, here is an exercise for cautioning against instant overreaction.\n\nWithout a first-round pick in 2023, Miami selected South Carolina cornerback Cam Smith at pick number 51. General manager Chris Grier followed that pick with third-round running back De'Von Achane.\n\nThe two were polar opposites in rookie production, with Achane an Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate, while Smith saw the least snaps from any second-round player last year.\n\nGrier's other two picks in 2023 were underwhelming at best. He selected Stanford wide receiver Elijah Higgins, only to be traded after an attempt at a tight end conversion. Grier's fourth and last pick was Michigan offensive tackle Ryan Hayes in the seventh round. Hayes was relegated to the practice squad during the 2023 season.\n\nAt the time of last year's draft, Sports Illustrated's Matt Verderame wasn't sold on the class, giving it a (D+). The New York Post's Ryan Dunleavy agreed initially, calling Achane a \"strange choice.\" Other negative grades came from DraftKings' Pete Hernandez, calling the Smith pick a \"head-scratcher.\"\n\nThe Ringer's Danny Kelly was pretty accurate in one appraisal, stating in his 2023 post-draft recap, \"I'm completely serious when I say that the Dolphins could have walked away from this draft with only running back De'Von Achane, and I would have called this class a success.\" He gave the class a (B) as a whole.\n\nYet his initial reaction to Smith is a case in point for this study. \"I am also a fan of South Carolina cornerback Cam Smith...\"\n\nTouchdown Wire's Doug Farrar spilt in his initial thoughts, saying, \"Cam Smith is an NFL-ready cornerback who is just as good in off-coverage as he is in press; he does everything well with no real liabilities.\"\n\nFarrar also said, \"And for a team that under head coach Mike McDaniel wants to put a track team on the field on offense, Devon Achane is a literal perfect fit, as his track background shows up all over the field.\" He gave the team draft a (C+) grade.\n\nThere were positive grades from reputable outlets such as Fox Sports (B+), NFL.com (B-), and The Sporting News from the 2023 class.\n\nLooking back at 2022, again with just four picks due to the Tyreek Hill trade, Grier started out in the third round with Georgia linebacker Channing Tindall. He went with wide receiver Erik Ezukanma from Texas Tech in the fourth, yet neither he nor Tindall has consistently contributed.\n\nThe grades here ranged from an A-minus by USA Today to a D-plus from SB Nation. Sports Illustrated's Conor Orr gave the 2022 class a C after the weekend, stating that while a \"small class,\" the picks did \"surprise\" him.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper, Jr. gave the group a B-minus saying, \"Channing Tindall (102) could be a steal.\"\n\nThe 2021 draft was successful for the Dolphins overall, hitting on first-rounders Jaylen Waddle at sixth and Jaelan Phillips at 18th. Jevon Holland in the second round at 36th was one of the team's better day two picks in recent memory, but the other second-rounder, Liam Eichenberg, in a trade up at 42nd hasn't panned out as well.\n\nEarly reports about Eichenberg were very solid out of Notre Dame, but he has yet to own a solidified starting job and has bounced around the Miami offensive line since his rookie year.\n\nThe last three remaining picks for Miami are all no longer Dolphins. Hunter Long was traded to the Los Angeles Rams as part of the Jalen Ramsey deal, and Larnel Coleman and Gerrid Doaks combined for one game played in their Miami careers as seventh-round selections.\n\nRegardless of what happened with the back end of the draft, 2021's class was graded as a consensus top-four across NFL media.\n\nWith grades from well over 20 outlets and reporters, 2021 was very favorable for the Dolphins in an immediate sense. In this class's case, the grades in the metaphorical classroom carried onto the real playing field.\n\nThere was only one grade lower than a B-minus in 2021 among this group above, and it was a C-plus from NBC Sports Edge. Sports Illustrated's Orr gave the class an A-minus and Pro Football Focus went A-plus.\n\nGetting deeper into the cautionary tale of draft grading, 2020 was interesting to look back and see some initial reaction grades. As the draft concluded, a CBS Sports report card had D+ grades for Raekwon Davis and Brandon Jones, while Curtis Weaver received an A+ from the same writer.\n\nDavis and Jones each signed free agency deals with new teams for a few million dollars a year apiece, and Weaver was a camp cut.\n\nThe exact same report card had an A+ grade for jettisoned cornerback Noah Igbinoghene and a C- for Austin Jackson. Tua Tagovailoa was given a B, and new Carolina Panthers guard Robert Hunt got a B-.\n\nNFL.com's Dan Parr gave the Dolphins 2020 class an A- -- three of the 11 selections are still with Miami: Tagovailoa, Jackson, and long-snapper Blake Ferguson.\n\nIn his article following this draft, Parr said, \"I'm a fan of the risk they were willing to take with their first selection. Tagovailoa 's potential was too great to pass up, even with the injury concerns.\"\n\nParr had a mixed bag of a retro-review with the middle picks in the class, saying, \"The Igbinoghene pick foreshadowed the Dolphins' theme for Day 2 of the draft, as the master plan of adding tough, physical, powerful talent was fully revealed with the selections of Hunt, Davis and Jones.\"\n\nParr had a glowing review of a miss, saying, \"Big fan of the work they did on the defensive line on Day 3, landing a Senior Bowl standout (Jason Strowbridge) and a potential steal in [Curtis] Weaver...\"\n\nA year earlier, the 2019 class was half the size. Christian Wilkins was the 13th overall pick followed by Michael Dieter in Round 3. The Dolphins traded their second-round pick to acquire quarterback Josh Rosen from the Arizona Cardinals. There was no fourth-rounder as well as being out of the second round, Grier selected Andrew Van Ginkel in the fifth.\n\nThe rest of the class was offensive lineman Isaiah Prince, and a pair of seventh-rounders in the backfield in fullback Chandler Cox and running back Myles Gaskin.\n\nNone remain on the current roster after Wilkins and Van Ginkel took free agent deals with Las Vegas and Minnesota, respectively.\n\nAs for the grades back in April of 2019, in an SI.com piece written by Andy Benoit he gave the Dolphins an A, saying, \"Interestingly, Christian Wilkins, though a highly regarded first-round talent, doesn't completely fit this profile. Wilkins's game is built more on movement than force.\"\n\nStaying on Wilkins, the rest of the media world spoke a bit higher of the Clemson product. Walter Football, a popular draft scouting source gave the Wilkins pick an A, saying, \"The Dolphins just picked a high-character player who was a team captain at his school...This is a great pick that must be in the 'A' range, as Wilkins will be able to replace Ndamukong Suh's production.\n\nThe Ringer's Danny Kelly had a solid B rating, yet also was early on what initially was a knock on Wilkins. \"The former Tiger lacks elite pass-rush upside and doesn't possess rare traits in any particular category, but he's as solid a three-down interior tackle as they come.\"\n\nLooking back at 2018, just two remain Dolphins in fourth round tight end Durham Smythe and kicker Jason Sanders. Recently released linebacker Jerome Baker was a third-round pick, and former 2022 franchise-tagged tight end Mike Gesicki was a second-round selection.\n\nThe first Dolphins pick overall was Alabama safety, Minkah Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers his second season for a first-round pick, which turned into Austin Jackson.\n\nMel Kiper, Jr. gave this class a C+, saying specifically of Fitzpatrick, \"I thought he was a top-five player in this class, but teams got a little scared because he doesn't have a true position. He's a little bit of a tweener who doesn't have true safety measurables.\"\n\nFitzpatrick has made four Pro Bowls and was named an All-Pro safety three times.\n\nSports Illustrated's Andy Benoit gave the class a B, saying after the draft, \"Adam Gase's scheme, which is built around unbalanced 3x1 formations, needs a prominent receiving tight end who can split wide by himself on the backside and make catches -- and second-rounder Mike Gesicki is built for that.\"\n\nThey say hindsight is 20/20, and that certainly applies to looking at recent reactions immediately following the last name called. While Mr. Irrelevant' s name being called closes the process as the final pick, his selection begins the immediate grading process for draft classes.\n\nBut as this study shows, proceed with caution when putting stock in grades over the next few days and weeks.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_sarney@si.com", "name":

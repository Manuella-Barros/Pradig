The government raised protests with the Chinese government over the altercation in the Yellow Sea off the Korean coastline.\n\n\"The consequence of being hit by the flares would have been significant,\" Marles said. \"Importantly, the helicopter was unaffected and all the crew are safe.\n\n\"This is a very serious incident. It was unsafe and it is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe encounter, first reported by Nine News on Monday evening, occurred about 7.30pm on Saturday. No injuries were reported. The Albanese government has condemned the incident in the same grave terms it used after accusing a Chinese navy ship of targeting Australian divers with sonar pulses late last year.\n\nDefence sources said Australian destroyer HMAS Hobart was in international waters in the Yellow Sea, which is situated between China's eastern coast and South Korea's western coast. The ship is participating in the United Nations' Operation Argos, enforcing international sanctions against North Korea.\n\nA Navy Seahawk helicopter, attached to HMAS Hobart, was conducting what was described as a routine flight when it was said to have been intercepted by a Chinese J-10 fighter jet.\n\nMarles accused the Chinese jet of dropping flares in front of the helicopter, at a distance said to be 300 metres in front and 60 metres above the Australian chopper. He said the Australian pilot had to take evasive action to avoid the flares.\n\nA defence department statement said the Chinese aircraft \"released flares along the flight path of the Australian defence force (ADF) helicopter. This was an unsafe manoeuvre which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel.\"\n\nMarles called the incident \"both unsafe and unprofessional\". He had applied the same description to the November 2023 encounter between HMAS Toowoomba and a People's Liberation Army navy destroyer.\n\nDefence said the Chinese ship had deployed its sonar unit against Australian divers working to untangle fishing nets from the Toowoomba's propellers, leading to minor injuries to two crew.\n\nChina's national defence ministry spokesperson, Wu Qian, denied the claims at the time, saying the Chinese ship \"kept a safe distance from the Australian vessel and did not conduct any activity that could affect the Australian side's diving operations\".\n\nRegarding the weekend's flare incident, the defence department said Australia \"expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a professional and safe manner\".\n\n\"Defence has, for decades, undertaken maritime surveillance activities in the region and does so in accordance with international law, exercising the right to freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace.\"\n\nMarles gave a similar comment, saying: \"We expect that when we have interactions with other militaries, including with the Chinese military, that those interactions are professional and safe. The interactions that were occurring by the PLA air force were unacceptable.\n\n\"We have formally expressed our concerns about this incident, and formally expressed that this was both unsafe and unprofessional. It is our expectation in the interaction of our two militaries is that they happen in a manner which is professional and safe for all concerned.\n\n\"HMAS Hobart continues in its work in enforcing those UN security council sanctions.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_butler@theguardian.com", "name": "Josh Butler",

The incident in international waters raises concerns over Chinese military tactics, with similar incidents involving other nations. US and allies, including Australia, are ramping up air capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region in response to Chinese intimidation tactics.\n\nAustralia has condemned the actions of a Chinese fighter jet after it intentionally dropped flares in front of an Australian helicopter. The incident happened on Saturday evening off the coast of South Korea, with the helicopter forced to conduct evasive maneuvers to avoid hitting the flares.\n\nChinese jet drops flares on Australian Navy chopper\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, a People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force Chengdu J-10 fighter jet intercepted an Australian Navy MH-60R Seahawk helicopter over the Yellow Sea before dropping flares in its flight path from above. After launching from the destroyer HMAS Hobart, the helicopter was performing a routine flight over the Yellow Sea as part of Operation Argos, which enforces UN sanctions on North Korea by policing illegal shipping activity.\n\nAs per an Australian Defense Department statement,\n\n\"During these activities, a Royal Australian Navy MH-60R helicopter launched from HMAS Hobart was intercepted by a PLA-AF fighter aircraft. The PLA-AF aircraft released flares across the flight path of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) helicopter. This was an unsafe maneuver which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel.\"\n\nPhoto: kev Hughes | Shutterstock\n\nAt around 19:30 AEST, the Chinese jet reportedly released the flares into the flight path of the Seahawk, dropping them from around 60 meters above and 300 meters in front of the chopper. Defense Minister Richard Marles said that the pilot of the helicopter was forced to take evasive action to avoid hitting the flares. Marles told 9News,\n\n\"When you consider the speed at which fighter planes and helicopters move, the reaction time is measured in a couple of seconds, and the consequences of the flare actually making contact could have been deeply significant, potentially putting lives at risk.\"\n\nThe evasive maneuvers ensured there were no injuries or damage to the aircraft sustained. However, things could have been a lot worse had the pilot not reacted in time.\n\n\"Unsafe and unprofessional\"\n\nThe Australian government has formally approached Chinese authorities with its concerns, and this is not the first incident in international waters involving the two nations. Back in November, several Australian Navy divers were injured after a Chinese vessel let off sonar pulses, with Chinese authorities placing the blame on Australia. China's air force has also engaged in such tactics, including making shows of force while intercepting other military aircraft.\n\nIn March, United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink spoke out against China's intimidation tactics in contested maritime territories. Chinese ships have often engaged in hostile behaviors without progressing into direct aggression, such as sideswiping or hosing down other vessels, as the country seeks to cement its presence. The US and its allies have been steadily increasing their air capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region in response.\n\nWhat do you make of this story?

China denied it had used its sonar, however Australia rejected the explanation.\n\nHMAS Hobart continues to operate in the area despite Saturday's confrontation, Marles said. Australia has been participating in missions to enforce sanctions against North Korea in the region since 2018.\n\nChina's Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis JacksonEditing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Macfie)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

injuries sustained by ADF personnel or damage caused to the MH-60R helicopter, the safety and wellbeing of our ADF personnel continues to be our utmost priority,\" the department added.\n\nThe incident occurred a day after it was revealed Australia's Navy Chief had recently confronted his Chinese counterpart over another incident last November where divers were injured in a sonar attack also in international waters.\n\nOn that occasion Australia accused the Chinese destroyer CNS Ningbo of injuring Australian navy divers with sonar pulses in Japanese waters.\n\nAustralia said China disregarded a safety warning to keep away from the Australian frigate HMAS Toowoomba in an action that mirrored a similar event involving the armed forces of both nations in 2022.\n\nChina maintains

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nThe Australian government said Monday that a Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force fighter jet released flares dangerously close to an Australian Defence Force helicopter over the weekend.\n\nThe PLAAF jet intercepted the Royal Australian Navy MH-60R helicopter attached to HMAS Hobart in the Yellow Sea and \"released flares across the flight path of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) helicopter,\" the Australian government said in a statement.\n\nThe Australian warship was in the area in support of Operation Argos, which is aimed at enforcing sanctions on North Korea.\n\nAustralian Defense Minister Richard Marles said a Chinese J-10 fighter aircraft popped flares about 300 meters in front of the helicopter and about 60 meters above it, per reporting from the AP.\n\nCanberra called China's flight conduct in this interaction \"unsafe and unprofessional.\"\n\n\"This was an unsafe manoeuvre which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\" the statement said. \"While there were no injuries sustained by ADF personnel or damage caused to the MH-60R helicopter, the safety and wellbeing of our ADF personnel continues to be our utmost priority.\"\n\nBeijing has yet to publicly respond to the allegations.\n\nThis isn't the first incident involving a Chinese jet engaging in troubling behavior in the vicinity of an Australian aircraft.\n\nIn June 2022, a Chinese J-16 patrolling the South China Sea released flares and chaff, or strips of aluminum intended to confuse the radar on a missile, close enough to an Australian P-8 that the strips got caught in its engine.\n\nThe US released records in October 2023 reporting numerous instances of aggressive flight conduct from China.\n\nThe 2023 Department of Defense report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China found that from fall 2021 to 2023, there were over 180 cases of \"coercive and risky air intercepts against U.S. aircraft in the region\" linked to Chinese aircraft.\n\nThis number of cases recorded over the course of two years is more than in the past decade.\n\n\"The PLA's behavior contravenes flight safety protocols and

This intercept is not the first 'unsafe and unprofessional' incident involving Chinese aircraft. China routinely engages in unsafe intercepts of US and allied aircraft.\n\nThe Australian government said Monday that a Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force fighter jet released flares dangerously close to an Australian Defence Force helicopter over the weekend.\n\nThe PLAAF jet intercepted the Royal Australian Navy MH-60R helicopter attached to HMAS Hobart in the Yellow Sea and \"released flares across the flight path of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) helicopter,\" the Australian government said in a statement.\n\nThe Australian warship was in the area in support of Operation Argos, which is aimed at enforcing sanctions on North Korea.\n\nAustralian Defense Minister Richard Marles said a Chinese J-10 fighter aircraft popped flares about 300 meters in front of the helicopter and about 60 meters above it, per reporting from the AP.\n\nCanberra called China's flight conduct in this interaction \"unsafe and unprofessional.\"\n\n\"This was an unsafe manoeuvre which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\" the statement said. \"While there were no injuries sustained by ADF personnel or damage caused to the MH-60R helicopter, the safety and wellbeing of our ADF personnel continues to be our utmost priority.\"\n\nBeijing has yet to publicly respond to the allegations.\n\nThis isn't the first incident involving a Chinese jet engaging in troubling behavior in the vicinity of an Australian aircraft.\n\nIn June 2022, a Chinese J-16 patrolling the South China Sea released flares and chaff, or strips of aluminum intended to confuse the radar on a missile, close enough to an Australian P-8 that the strips got caught in its engine.\n\nThe US released records in October 2023 reporting numerous instances of aggressive flight conduct from China.\n\nThe 2023 Department of Defense report on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China found that from fall 2021 to 2023, there were over 180 cases of \"coercive and risky air intercepts against U.S. aircraft in the region\" linked to Chinese aircraft.\n\nThis number of cases recorded over the course of two years is more than in the past decade.\n\n\"The PLA's behavior contravenes flight safety protocols and the international maritime rules of the road, and increases the risk of a major accident, incident, or crisis, including the potential for loss of life,\" the report said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The incident was lambasted as \"unacceptable\" by Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles.\n\nAccording to Marles, the helicopter pilot had to maneuver to avoid getting struck by the flares. The incident happened over the Yellow Sea, off the coast of Korea, prompting the authorities to lodge protests with the Chinese administration.\n\n\"The consequence of being hit by the flares would have been significant,\" Marles said. \"Importantly, the helicopter was unaffected, and all the crew are safe.\" \"This was an incident which was both unsafe and unprofessional,\" he told the media.\n\nAs per the statement released by the Australian Defense Department, the helicopter in question was a Royal Australian Navy's SeaHawk that took off from the destroyer HMAS Hobart from 300 meters away. Soon after, a Chinese PLA Air Force J-10 fighter jet came dangerously close at about 300 meters and 65 meters above the chopper and released flares.\n\nThe flare or chaff is normally released by military aircraft as a countermeasure to confuse hostile missiles trying to shoot down the jet, but it can also be used to sabotage an aircraft.\n\nRichard Marles said, \"Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries professionally and safely.\" He further observed that \"Defence has, for decades, undertaken maritime surveillance activities in the region and does so by international law, exercising the right to freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace.\"\n\nThe incident comes at a time of rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific. The Chinese fighter's firing of flares came after the defense leaders of the US, Australia, Japan, and the Philippines met in Hawaii in what has been understood to be a dialogue aimed at working out strategies to counter China and its military in the region.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time a Chinese jet has been accused of carrying out a dangerous maneuver against an Australian aircraft. In June 2022, the Australian Defense Department lodged a strong protest over another dangerous maneuver conducted by a PLAAF J-16 fighter jet against an Australian P-8A surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea.\n\nThe Chinese aircraft \"flew very close to the side of the [Australian] P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft\" and then \"released flares,\" Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters at the time.\n\nHowever, this time, China dispatched a J-10 fighter instead of a J-16, typically deployed for these interception missions by the PLAAF.\n\nBefore the J-10's ascent, most of China's fighter jet inventory comprised license-built variants of Soviet-origin platforms and Soviet-manufactured aircraft. The J-10, for China, signifies a significant advancement in its efforts to produce fighters domestically.\n\nChina Gets 'Unrestricted Access' To US Backyard Just 100 Miles Off Florida; Should Washington Worry?\n\nThe J-10 is a medium-weight, single-engine jet fighter that can operate in all weather conditions. It's the first indigenous advanced jet fighter made in China. In 2020, Pakistan became the first overseas customer of this aircraft.\n\nChina began developmental work on the J-10 in 1984, shortly after the United States and the Soviet Union introduced F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mikoyan MiG-29 in 1978 and 1982, respectively.\n\nLast year, Beijing marked 25 years of service of the indigenously developed fourth-generation fighter jet, which remains the mainstay of the country's air power.\n\nAll these years later, China has had multiple aircraft variants, with the most advanced being the J-10C fighter, classified as a 4+ generation fighter and aggressively pushed for export. Earlier this year, the aircraft participated in the World Defense Show in Saudi Arabia, where it garnered attention from several Middle Eastern countries.\n\nThe J-10C underwent a significant overhaul in 2018 and is now projected as a cutting-edge 4+ generation fighter jet by China. Earlier this year, a video published by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) showed a rare refueling of seven J-10C Fighter jets by a single YY-20 refueling aircraft in a stunning display of PLAAF's might.\n\nThe J-10C can be equipped with various 4th-generation air-to-air missiles, including the Chinese PL-10 short-range missile and the PL-15 beyond visual range missile. The omni-role aircraft is armed with an advanced electronics warfare suite.\n\nThe J-10C in Chinese service has notable features like an infrared search and track and laser rangefinder dome in front of the cockpit, as well as a glass cockpit with a wide-angle holographic head-up display. It is also equipped with an Active Electronically-Scanned Array (AESA) radar.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latest Asian, Middle-East, EurAsian, Indian News"},

It is our expectation in the interaction of our two militaries is that they happen in a manner which is professional and safe for all concerned.\"\n\nNo one was hurt and HMAS Hobart continued its mission to enforce sanctions, Mr Marles said.\n\n\"When you look at the speed at which fighter planes move, at which helicopters move, the reaction time here is measured in a couple of seconds. And the consequences of the flare actually making contact with the helicopter could have been deeply significant, would have put lives in danger,\" he said.\n\n\"Our concern is always for the welfare of the men and women who wear our nation's uniform who are serving as Defence Force personnel and the interactions that were occurring by the PLA Air Force were unacceptable.\"\n\nAustralian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst Malcolm Davis said: \"This is an extremely aggressive act and a deliberate one.\n\n\"There is no way this Chinese fighter pilot could have done this inadvertently or unintentionally. Once again as Australia seeks stabilisation the Chinese throw that back in our faces with their latest actions,\" Dr Davis said.\n\nSaturday's incident - which comes ahead of a mooted visit to Australia next month by Chinese Premier Li Qiang - is the latest in a growing list of times the Chinese military has made risky challenges to the presence of Australian personnel.\n\nIn November, divers based on HMAS Toowoomba were injured when a Chinese warship pulsed their sonar while they were in the water in Japan's exclusive economic zone.\n\nIn May 2022, a Chinese fighter jet set off flares and dumped chaff when intercepted an Australia P-8 plane conducting routine surveillance in the South China Sea. The RAAF jet's engine ingested the chaff but the plane was able to land safely.\n\nIn February 2022, a Chinese destroyer directed a laser beam at a P-8 plane that sailed through the Arafura Sea, within Australia's exclusive economic zone.\n\nStrategic Analysis Australia director Michael Shoebridge said clearly Australia's earlier protests about China's unsafe interactions had not changed Beijing's behaviour.\n\n\"It's time for the prime minister to pick up the phone and use this special relationship that he has told us he has built with Xi Jinping and tell him this dangerous behaviour before people die,\" he said.\n\nAustralia is not alone.

"title": "Australian Government criticises 'unsafe and unprofessional' interaction with Chinese Air Force over Yellow Sea", "body": "The Australian Government has responded after a Chinese fighter jet engaged in a risky confrontation with an Australian naval helicopter over the Yellow Sea.\n\nAustralia has lodged a formal complaint with Beijing following the incident, which saw a People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLA-AF) aircraft deploy flares across the flight path of the Royal Australian Navy's MH-60R helicopter.\n\nOn May 4th, HMAS Hobart was conducting routine surveillance operations in international waters as part of Operation Argos, which supports the enforcement of United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea.\n\nThe PLA-AF jet intercepted the Australian helicopter in a manoeuvre described by Australian officials as both \"unsafe and unprofessional\".\n\nAlthough the incident did not result in any injuries to the crew or damage to the helicopter, it raised serious concerns about the safety of Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel.\n\nThe Defence Ministry warned incidents like these could jeopardise the longstanding international agreement of safety and professionalism in military conduct.\n\n\"This was an unsafe manoeuvre, which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\" the ADF said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"While there were no injuries sustained by ADF personnel or damage caused to the MH-60R helicopter, the safety and wellbeing of our ADF personnel continues to be our utmost priority.\n\n\"Australia expects all countries, including China, to operate their militaries in a professional and safe manner.\"\n\nThe Australian Defence Ministry reaffirmed its commitment to upholding international law, underscoring the right to freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace.\n\nThe Ministry also reiterated its expectation that all nations, including China, adhere to these principles, ensuring their military operations do not pose risks to human life and are conducted responsibly.\n\nThis incident adds to a growing list of confrontations involving Chinese military forces and vessels from other countries as tensions continue to mount in the region.\n\n\"It's in character with the way the Chinese have been behaving,\" Mr Sheridan said on Sky News on Monday evening, describing the incident as \"profoundly disturbing\".\n\n\"But as I understand it, our naval presence there is in pursuit of the United Nations' resolution authorised by the United Nations, in what is indisputably international waters.\"\n\nSimilarly tense incidents have soured the waters between the two nations, with HMAS Toowoomba reportedly being disabled in \"international waters inside of Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone\" in the East China Sea in November.\n\nDespite acknowledging the frigate had Aussie naval divers in the water to untangle a fishing net from its propellers, a Chinese warship continued to approach before activating its sonar.\n\nNaval divers reportedly suffered injuries to their ears in the potentially fatal incident.\n\nAt the time, China accused HMAS Toowoomba of \"posing a threat\" to China's fishing boats, \"provoking\" Chinese warships and intruding on Chinese territorial waters.\n\nAustralia warned: 'Be careful'\n\nIt came after Beijing warned Australia to \"be careful\" against acting on its \"unwarranted anxieties toward China\", questioning how relations can improve while Canberra accuses it of coercion.\n\nIn an April opinion piece published by Chinese government mouthpiece the Global Times, Beijing lamented that despite a significant thawing in the bilateral relationship, Australia's newly published defence strategy undermined the inroads so far made on trade.\n\nChina also accused Canberra of falling victim to the Washington-led \"imaginary war with China\", warning that Australia's US-aligned defence strategy posed an \"extreme danger\" that would increase risks in the long run.\n\nThe warning came after it was revealed Australia's defence budget would increase by $50bn over the next decade in a bid to counter China's \"coercive tactics\" and the growing risk of regional conflict.\n\nThe strategy found the strategic environment had deteriorated over the past year, pointing to a rising risk of conflict in the Indo-Pacific as China builds up its military capabilities.\n\n\"The risk of a crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait is increasing, as well as at other flashpoints, including disputes in the South and East China Seas and on the border with India,\" the strategy said.\n\n\"In line with its growing strategic and economic weight, China is improving its capabilities in all areas of warfare at a pace and scale not seen in the world for nearly a century.\"\n\nA day after a Chinese government spokesman told Australia to \"abandon the Cold War mentality\", the Global Times piece went further, saying the strategy was a \"serious miscalculation\" of the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and a \"misjudgment of China's strategic intentions\".\n\n\"China and Australia have no historical grudges or fundamental conflicts of interest, and China has no intention of treating Australia as an enemy, but it is always described as a \"threat\" by Australia,\" the piece said.", "source":

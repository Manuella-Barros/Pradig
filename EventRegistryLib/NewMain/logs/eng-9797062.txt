That threat is very real right now.'\n\nIt comes after violent riots have exploded across several cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Plymouth and Birmingham following the Southport knife rampage which claimed the lives of three young girls and left many others injured.\n\nAnd just days ago gangs of masked thugs descended on hotels believed to be housing migrants and asylum seekers, with many starting fire to the buildings as they threw petrol bombs and projectiles at police.\n\nApproached by the BBC, Cllr Connolly defended his wife, saying that his wife had made one 'stupid, spur of the moment tweet out of frustration and quickly deleted it'.\n\nHe continued: 'She's a good person and she's not racist. She's got Somalian and Bangladeshi kids she looks after and she loves them like they're her own'.\n\nResponding on social media today, Ms Connolly said: I regret and apologise for a recent post that I made.

on fire.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Lucie Connolly wrote last Monday: \"Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f -- ing hotels full of the b -- for all I care, while you're at it take the treacherous government [and] politicians with them.\"\n\nMrs Connolly, who was a childminder at the time, resigned her registration with regulator Ofsted on Tuesday.\n\nIt followed listing site Childcare.co.uk confirming it had suspended a childminder from advertising on its platform after receiving information about a \"highly inappropriate tweet\".\n\nShe was arrested for inciting racial hatred and taken into custody on Tuesday, before being released on police bail pending further enquiries.\n\nMore than 400 people have been arrested across England and Northern Ireland so far in relation to far-Right riots taking place across the country over recent days.\n\nMrs Connolly, the wife of Tory councillor Raymond Connolly, is said to have written the post on the same day multiple children were stabbed in an attack that killed three girls in Southport.\n\nThe post continued: \"I feel physically sick knowing what these families will now have to endure.\n\n\"If that makes me racist, so be it.\"\n\nConnolly apologises for comments\n\nThe childminder later apologised for comments she had made and said she had acted on \"false and malicious\" information.\n\nThe brutal attacks in the Lancashire town had prompted misinformation to spread online, including false claims that Axel Rudakubana, the suspect, was an asylum seeker.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Connolly, vice chairman of the adult social care committee at West Northamptonshire Council, said his wife had made one \"stupid, spur-of-the-moment tweet out of frustration and quickly deleted it\".\n\n\"She's a good person and she's not racist,\" he said.\n\n\"She's got Somalian and Bangladeshi kids she looks after and she loves them like they're her own.\"\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday evening, Mrs Connolly said: \"I am someone who cares enormously about children and the similarity between those beautiful children who were so brutally attacked, and my own daughter, overwhelmed me with horror, but I should not have expressed that horror in the way that I did.\n\n\"This has been an invaluable lesson for me in realising how wrong and inaccurate things appearing on social media can be.\"\n\nA Northamptonshire Police spokesman said: \"A 41-year-old woman from Northampton arrested yesterday (Tuesday, August 6) on suspicion of inciting racial hatred has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fiona_parker@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Fiona Parker", "type": "author",

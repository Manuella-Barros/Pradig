{"id": 239773344, "title": "Leonardo group adds  Galway\u2019s five-star Celtic Tiger-era \u2018g\u2019 Hotel & Spa to fast-growing European portfolio", "text": "The five-star g Hotel was originally designed by milliner-to-the-stars Philip Treacy and opened its opulent doors at the height of the boom back in 2005. While the original backers ended up with debts in Nama, the business has carved out a strong niche and brand. The hotel has 101 bedrooms and a spa and caters for events of up to 300 people and its 18,000sq ft ground floor extends across three lounges. The hotel went through a \u20ac1m refurbishment in recent years. The g Hotel will retain its brand and join the Leonardo Limited Edition collection of individually branded hotels, which includes The Dilly, London, The Grand, Brighton, Hotel Gotham, Manchester and The Midland, Manchester. Leonardo, owned by Israeli billionaire David Fattal, will take over the running of the hotel from current operator Choice Hotel Group in the first of two deals it has lined up in Ireland this summer. Leonardo was tight-lipped on the price. When the Galway hotel was last sold in a 2019 deal, investment firm Alanis Capital paid more than \u20ac40m, according to reports at the time. Leonardo is also set to close a second \u201csignificant acquisition\u201d of a well-known Dublin hotel in the next six weeks, according to Leonardo Hotels UK & Ireland CEO Jason Carruthers. That second hotel is being earmarked by the group to become Dublin\u2019s second NYX hotel. After buying the Jurys chain in 2017, the groups has spent the past two years rebranding it. \u201cIreland is a really strong market for us and for some time, we\u2019ve been looking for additional opportunities there. \"So to be able to make this acquisition with the g Hotel \u2013 and another acquisition coming in a number of weeks \u2013 we are delighted about that,\u201d he said. \u201cGalway is a great city and we already know it really well because we operated the Jurys Inn, now the Leonardo, there,\u201d Carruthers told the Sunday Independent. \u201dThe city has got a really good mixture of arts, culture, history and outdoors. It has a huge domestic following in Ireland and operates at really high occupancies.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great that we can retain the name of the hotel because it has a really strong resonance in Ireland,\u201d he said. In January, Leonardo opened a 175-bedroom NYX hotel in Dublin\u2019s Portobello following a \u20ac31m investment. \u201cThe location [of NYX Portobello] is great,\u201d said Carruthers. \u201cIt\u2019s ramped up very, very quickly. We\u2019ve been able to hit high 90s in terms of occupancy for the next three months. \"And the next step is we\u2019ll be completing another deal in Ireland in the next six weeks.\u201d Carruthers said Leonardo had been looking for some time for further opportunities in key Irish cities. Dave Murray, senior director of CBRE\u2019s hotel team advised on the deal. \u201cThe completion of the sale of the 5-star g Hotel is a great result for both our client, Alanis Capital and the purchaser Fattal Hotel Group and the G is a great fit for Fattal, who already have a very successful portfolio in Ireland,\" he said. \u201cThe sale is the first transaction of scale for a trading hotel in Galway for 7 years and demonstrates the strong appetite from hotel investors for opportunities in Galway city. Trading performance in Galway has improved considerably in the last 2 years and as a result numerous hotel groups are looking to enter the market,\" he said.", "summary": "<p>Galway\u2019s Celtic Tiger-era g Hotel has been bought by fast-growing European hotel group Leonardo which bought the former Jurys Inn chain here in 2017 and is in the hunt for more Irish properties.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/business/leonardo-group-adds-galways-five-star-celtic-tiger-era-g-hotel-and-spa-to-fast-growing-european-portfolio/a1684501971.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/GXWj2DEygVdrOpXHHkYG2HqvdkQ=/0x0:3238x2158/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/1d057f63-7885-4250-9043-44392a5883bd/5b40b1c2-08b7-4e48-b30d-942cec72d054/SN%20GHOTEL%20ABOVE%20228139060.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:30:00", "author": "Fearghal O'connor", "authors": ["Fearghal O'connor"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.642}

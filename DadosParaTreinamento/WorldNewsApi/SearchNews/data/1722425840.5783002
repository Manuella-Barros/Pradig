She recalled one of her first gigs, playing to 10 people who \u201conly came because we offered them free drinks\u201d \u2013 and seemed overawed by how much that audience had grown. Almost 100,000 people watched the set, with fans stretching all the way back to Rowmead, an area that used to be reserved for campers, but which has been opened up in 2024 to allow bigger crowds to the Pyramid Stage. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot, innit? A lot to take in,\u201d Lipa said. \u201cLittle me would just be beside herself right now.\u201d It was a tiny moment of vulnerability in an armour-plated set. No song was left unpolished, no vocal left unharmonised, no hair left untossed. Dua hit every mark with the precision of someone who\u2019d been building towards this moment for years. But if that makes it sound clinical and sterile, it wasn\u2019t the case. Take, for example, the moment she rushed down to the barriers to get the crowd singing along to her early hit Be The One. It wasn\u2019t entirely spontaneous \u2013 in fact it riffed on a moment she pulled off at her last Glastonbury performance in 2017 \u2013 but the joy on the star\u2019s face as she climbed the fences and sang face to face with her fans was genuine.", "summary": "The pop star delivered an ambitious and exhausting set as she headlined the Pyramid Stage.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgl8xxnegeo", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c048/live/84b6ce20-35aa-11ef-a044-9d4367d5b599.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:39:28", "author": "Mark Savage", "authors": ["Mark Savage"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.186}

Presenter and star Ball, 60, welcomed listeners to the all-new Sunday Love Songs \u2013 his first time as host since the passing of radio legend Steve Wright. Wright, who died in February this year aged 69, had been the host of Steve Wright\u2019s Sunday Love Songs since its inception in 1996. The BBC announced in April that Ball would be appointed as Wright\u2019s full-time successor upon the show\u2019s return in June. Kicking off this new version of Sunday Love Songs, Ball marked his position by playing Love Is All Around by Wet Wet Wet \u2013 best known for the Christmassy version sung by Bill Nighy in Love Actually. And, as the show came to a close two hours later, Ball paid heartfelt tribute to his much-missed predecessor by playing one of Wright\u2019s favourite songs. Michael Ball has stepped in to take over the popular Sunday Love Songs show (Picture: BBC/PA Wire) \u2018For this first week, the last dance is a very special song. It was one of Steve Wright\u2019s favourites. So in memory of Steve, I want you to give someone a hug. Make that time for it now. \u2018Your partner, friend, child, parent. Even your pet, and if you\u2019re on your own right now, I\u2019m embracing you with a virtual hug. \u2018And I want to take this opportunity to thank Steve. His legacy on Radio 2 is immeasurable. He created Love Songs and I am so, so proud to be carrying the baton for him into the future. \u2018You are missed friend, and this is for you,\u2019 he finished, before playing Wichita Lineman by Glen Campbell \u2013 one of the late disc jockey\u2019s favourites.

(@kate_exhead) June 2, 2024 Wright rose to fame as a radio DJ with his BBC Radio 1 show in the 1980s, before making the move to their Breakfast Show from 1994 to 1995. He then moved to Radio 2, where he first hosted Steve Wright\u2019s Saturday Show before launching Steve Wright in the Afternoon, which aired on weekdays from 1999 to 20002. Signing off his final afternoon show in September 2022, Wright played out with Radio Ga Ga by Queen. Steve Wright passed away in February (Picture: REX/Shutterstock) Those are the closing moments of Steve Wright on the afternoon on Radio 2,\u2019 intoned Wright as the ballad ended. He continued to present Sunday Love Songs until his death in February, with Nicki Chapman filling in before Ball\u2019s appointment. No inquest will be held into the star\u2019s death, with the police remarking that the incident was \u2018unexpected, but is not being treated as suspicious.\u2019 Announcing that he would be taking over the big show, Ball said: \u2018Steve made Love Songs \u201cappointment to listen\u201d radio. I\u2019m beyond excited to be tasked with the chance to continue with his extraordinary legacy.\u2019 Got a story?

The American company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe finalized version states Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it, the plea agreement says.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a $243.6 million fine. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying the company \"will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen\" those programs.\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing failed to live up to terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint.\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department said that Boeing \"took considerable steps\" to improve its anti-fraud compliance program since 2021, but the changes \"have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future.\"\n\nThat's where the independent monitor will come in, \"to reduce the risk of misconduct,\" the plea deal states.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal.

It's in the hands of a judge now", "body": "File - A door plug area of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft awaiting inspection is pictured with paneling removed at the airline's facilities at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Jan. 10, 2024, in SeaTac, Wash. On Sunday, July 7, 2024, the Justice Department said Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge stemming from two deadly crashes of 737 Max jetliners.\n\nThe Justice Department submitted an agreement with Boeing on Wednesday in which the aerospace giant will plead guilty to a fraud charge for misleading U.S. regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people.\n\nThe detailed plea agreement was filed in federal district court in Texas. The American company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe finalized version states Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it, the plea agreement says.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a $243.6 million fine. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying the company \"will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen\" those programs.\n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer for families of victims of the 737 Max crashes who wanted Boeing to face trial, criticized the agreement.\n\n\"The plea has all the problems in it that the families feared it would have. We will file a strong objection to the preferential and sweetheart treatment Boeing is receiving,\" he said.\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the FAA about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful and to use signals from two sensors, not just one.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing violated terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Cassell has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint. The agreement calls for the government to select the monitor \"with feedback from Boeing.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department said that Boeing \"took considerable steps\" to improve its anti-fraud compliance program since 2021, but the changes \"have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future.\"\n\nThat's where the independent monitor will come in, \"to reduce the risk of misconduct,\" the plea deal states.\n\nBoeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, is a major Pentagon and NASA contractor, and a guilty plea is not expected to change that. Government agencies have leeway to hire companies even after a criminal conviction. The plea agreement does not address the topic.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal. Boeing and the Justice Department will have 14 days to respond, and the families will get five days to reply to the filings by the company and the government.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com",

It's in the hands of a judge now", "body": "The Justice Department has filed an agreement in which Boeing will plead guilty to a fraud charge for misleading regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people\n\nThe Justice Department submitted an agreement with Boeing on Wednesday in which the aerospace giant will plead guilty to a fraud charge for misleading U.S. regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people.\n\nThe detailed plea agreement was filed in federal district court in Texas. The American company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe finalized version states Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it, the plea agreement says.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a $243.6 million fine. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying the company \"will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen\" those programs.\n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer for families of victims of the 737 Max crashes who wanted Boeing to face trial, criticized the agreement.\n\n\"The plea has all the problems in it that the families feared it would have. We will file a strong objection to the preferential and sweetheart treatment Boeing is receiving,\" he said.\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the FAA about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful and to use signals from two sensors, not just one.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing violated terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Cassell has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint. The agreement calls for the government to select the monitor \"with feedback from Boeing.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department said that Boeing \"took considerable steps\" to improve its anti-fraud compliance program since 2021, but the changes \"have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future.\"\n\nThat's where the independent monitor will come in, \"to reduce the risk of misconduct,\" the plea deal states.\n\nBoeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, is a major Pentagon and NASA contractor, and a guilty plea is not expected to change that. Government agencies have leeway to hire companies even after a criminal conviction. The plea agreement does not address the topic.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal.

It's in the hands of a judge now", "body": "File - A door plug area of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft awaiting inspection is pictured with paneling removed at the airline's facilities at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Jan. 10, 2024, in SeaTac, Wash. On Sunday, July 7, 2024, the Justice Department said Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge stemming from two deadly crashes of 737 Max jetliners.\n\nThe Justice Department submitted an agreement with Boeing on Wednesday in which the aerospace giant will plead guilty to a fraud charge for misleading U.S. regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people.\n\nThe detailed plea agreement was filed in federal district court in Texas. The American company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe final version states Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud a Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it, the plea agreement says.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a fine of at least $243.6 million. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying the company \"will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen\" those programs.\n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer for families of victims of the 737 Max crashes who wanted Boeing to face trial, criticized the agreement.\n\n\"The plea has all the problems in it that the families feared it would have. We will file a strong objection to the preferential and sweetheart treatment Boeing is receiving,\" he said.\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the FAA about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful and to use signals from two sensors, not just one.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing violated terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Cassell has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint. The agreement calls for the government to select the monitor \"with feedback from Boeing.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department said that Boeing \"took considerable steps\" to improve its anti-fraud compliance program since 2021, but the changes \"have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future.\"\n\nThat's where the independent monitor will come in, \"to reduce the risk of misconduct,\" the plea deal states.\n\nBoeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, is a major Pentagon and NASA contractor, and a guilty plea is not expected to change that. Government agencies have leeway to hire companies even after a criminal conviction. The plea agreement does not address the topic.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nBoeing could appeal any order the court imposes to pay restitution to victims' families -- the agreement leaves restitution up to the judge. The company could also appeal if the judge indirectly increases the fine beyond $243.6 million by failing to give Boeing credit for an identical amount it paid as part of the 2021 settlement.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal. Boeing and the Justice Department will have 14 days to respond, and the families will get five days to reply to the filings by the company and the government.", "source": {"uri":

It's in the hands of a judge now", "body": "The Justice Department has filed an agreement in which Boeing will plead guilty to a fraud charge for misleading regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people\n\nThe Justice Department submitted an agreement with Boeing on Wednesday in which the aerospace giant will plead guilty to a fraud charge for misleading U.S. regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people.\n\nThe detailed plea agreement was filed in federal district court in Texas. The American company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe finalized version states Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it, the plea agreement says.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a $243.6 million fine. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying the company \"will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen\" those programs.\n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer for families of victims of the 737 Max crashes who wanted Boeing to face trial, criticized the agreement.\n\n\"The plea has all the problems in it that the families feared it would have. We will file a strong objection to the preferential and sweetheart treatment Boeing is receiving,\" he said.\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the FAA about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful and to use signals from two sensors, not just one.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing violated terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Cassell has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint. The agreement calls for the government to select the monitor \"with feedback from Boeing.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department said that Boeing \"took considerable steps\" to improve its anti-fraud compliance program since 2021, but the changes \"have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future.\"\n\nThat's where the independent monitor will come in, \"to reduce the risk of misconduct,\" the plea deal states.\n\nBoeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, is a major Pentagon and NASA contractor, and a guilty plea is not expected to change that. Government agencies have leeway to hire companies even after a criminal conviction. The plea agreement does not address the topic.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal. Boeing and the Justice Department will have 14 days to respond, and the families will get five days to reply to the filings by the company and the government.\n\nMore from this section\n\nPromoting the Value of Drug-Free Living at the UEFA Championship Games\n\nMMI Taps Dan Jones as Chief Data Officer as It Expands Data Initiatives and Features\n\nSalt Lake City celebrates announcement that it will host the 2034 Winter Olympics", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_koenig@kulr8.com", "name": "David Koenig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reed O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX groundings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stall (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_G._Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul G.

The American company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe finalized version states Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it, the plea agreement says.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a $243.6 million fine. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying the company \"will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen\" those programs.\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing failed to live up to terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint.\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department said that Boeing \"took considerable steps\" to improve its anti-fraud compliance program since 2021, but the changes \"have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future.\"\n\nThat's where the independent monitor will come in, \"to reduce the risk of misconduct,\" the plea deal states.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal.

On Sunday, July 7, 2024, the Justice Department said Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge stemming from two deadly crashes of 737 Max jetliners.\n\nThe Justice Department submitted an agreement with Boeing on Wednesday in which the aerospace giant will plead guilty to a fraud charge for misleading U.S. regulators who approved the 737 Max jetliner before two of the planes crashed, killing 346 people.\n\nThe detailed plea agreement was filed in federal district court in Texas. The American aerospace company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe finalized version states that Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a $243.6 million fine. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing failed to live up to terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal. Boeing and the Justice Department will have 14 days to respond, and the families will get five days to reply to the filings by the company and the government.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_koenig@yakimaherald.com", "name": "David Koenig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle\u2013Tacoma_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaTac,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SeaTac, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "SeaTac, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reed O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stall (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_G._Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul G.

Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it, the plea agreement says.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a fine of at least $243.6 million. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing issued a statement saying the company \"will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen\" those programs.\n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer for families of victims of the 737 Max crashes who wanted Boeing to face trial, criticized the agreement.\n\n\"The plea has all the problems in it that the families feared it would have. We will file a strong objection to the preferential and sweetheart treatment Boeing is receiving,\" he said.\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the FAA about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned MCAS to make it less powerful and to use signals from two sensors, not just one.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing violated terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Cassell has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint. The agreement calls for the government to select the monitor \"with feedback from Boeing.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department said that Boeing \"took considerable steps\" to improve its anti-fraud compliance program since 2021, but the changes \"have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future.\"\n\nThat's where the independent monitor will come in, \"to reduce the risk of misconduct,\" the plea deal states.\n\nBoeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, is a major Pentagon and NASA contractor, and a guilty plea is not expected to change that. Government agencies have leeway to hire companies even after a criminal conviction. The plea agreement does not address the topic.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nBoeing could appeal any order the court imposes to pay restitution to victims' families -- the agreement leaves restitution up to the judge. The company could also appeal if the judge indirectly increases the fine beyond $243.6 million by failing to give Boeing credit for an identical amount it paid as part of the 2021 settlement.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_G._Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul G.

Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing failed to live up to terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal. Boeing and the Justice Department will have 14 days to respond, and the families will get five days to reply to the filings by the company and the government.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reed O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stall (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_G._Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul G.

The American aerospace company and the Justice Department reached a deal on the guilty plea and the agreement's broad terms earlier this month.\n\nThe finalized version states that Boeing admitted that through its employees, it made an agreement \"by dishonest means\" to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration group that evaluated the 737 Max. Because of Boeing's deception, the FAA had \"incomplete and inaccurate information\" about the plane's flight-control software and how much training pilots would need for it.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor can accept the agreement and the sentence worked out between Boeing and prosecutors, or he could reject it, which likely would lead to new negotiations between the company and the Justice Department.\n\nThe deal calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, three years of probation and a $243.6 million fine. It also requires Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nBoeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about the new software system, called MCAS, that could turn the plane's nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.\n\nMax planes crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control.\n\nBoeing avoided prosecution in 2021 by reaching a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department that included a previous $243.6 million fine. It appeared that the fraud charge would be permanently dismissed until January, when a panel covering an unused exit blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. That led to new scrutiny of the company's safety.\n\nIn May of this year, prosecutors said Boeing failed to live up to terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed this month to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring a potentially lengthy public trial.\n\nThe role and authority of the monitor is viewed as a key provision of the new plea deal, according to experts in corporate governance and white-collar crime. Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, has said that families of the crash victims should have the right to propose a monitor for the judge to appoint.\n\nSome of the passengers' relatives plan to ask the judge to reject the plea deal. They want a full trial, a harsher penalty for Boeing, and many of them want current and former Boeing executives to be charged.\n\nIf the judge approves the deal, it would apply to the the criminal charge stemming from the 737 Max crashes. It would not resolve other matters, potentially including litigation related to the Alaska Airlines blowout.\n\nO'Connor will give lawyers for the families seven days to file legal motions opposing the plea deal. Boeing and the Justice Department will have 14 days to respond, and the families will get five days to reply to the filings by the company and the government.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reed O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stall (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_G._Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul G.

plea deal filed in fatal 737 Max crashes", "body": "Boeing will plead guilty to fraud as part of a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, according to a court filing Wednesday.\n\nThe agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which a total of 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.\n\nThe plea deal must be approved by a federal court judge and it includes an additional $243.6 million to be paid by Boeing on top of a previous fine of the same amount.\n\n\"We will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen our safety, quality and compliance programs,\" a spokesperson for the aircraft manufacturer told AFP while confirming the court filing.\n\nThe high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.\n\nBoeing violated the DPA \"by failing to sufficiently design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud laws throughout its operations,\" prosecutor said in court documents.\n\nBoeing conspired to defraud US air traffic safety regulators about the Max 737 while the aircraft was being certified, according to the filing.\n\nBoeing admitted in April 2019 that anti-stall flight software was partly to blame in the crashes.\n\nTerms of the plea deal call for Boeing to serve three years of \"organizational probation\", conditions of which include having an independent monitor and investing at least $455 million on compliance, quality and safety programs, according to the filing.\n\n- Facing families -\n\nFamilies of crash victims have objected to the deal, arguing that it \"unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive.\"\n\nThe company's board of directors will be required to meet the families of victims of the crashes in 2018 and 2019 crashes under terms of the plea deal.\n\nFamilies of victims declined to comment Wednesday but have said previously they will ask the court to reject the plea deal.\n\n\"The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises,\" said an objection filed by their legal team when word of the plea deal first surfaced.\n\nThe original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded US aviation regulators.\n\nThat agreement required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\nA three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.\n\nBut in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.\n\nThe incident launched a new wave of scrutiny into Boeing's manufacturing and safety practices, with formal probes initiated by US regulators and Congress.\n\nIn a May 14 letter to the court overseeing the MAX case, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by \"failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations.\"\n\nThe conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it had not violated the 2021 agreement.\n\ngc-elm/jgc", "source": {"uri":

guilty plea to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and agreed to pay a $243.6 million (\u20ac224 million) fine after it breached a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement with the US Justice Department, according to a court filing.\n\nThe plane maker allowed potentially risky work at its factories and did not ensure key airplane record keeping was accurate or complete, the Justice Department said as it outlined why it believed the plane maker had violated the 2021 deal.\n\nBoeing on 7 July agreed in principle to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration after the government said the plane maker knowingly made false representations about key software for the 737 MAX.\n\nBoeing confirmed that it had filed a detailed plea agreement with the Justice Department.\n\n\"We will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen our safety, quality and compliance programs,\" the company said.\n\nThe Justice Department said in May that Boeing had breached its obligations in the agreement that shielded the plane maker from criminal prosecution stemming from misrepresentations about a key software feature tied to fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nThe finding was made in the wake of a January in-flight panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX that exposed continuing safety and quality issues at Boeing, just two days before the 2021 agreement shielding it from prosecution over the previous fatal crashes expired.\n\nThe Justice Department said in its court filing that Boeing failed to ensure employees documented removal of parts during manufacturing of an airplane and it did not ensure mechanics and inspectors who stamped their completed work had actually done so.\n\nThe Justice Department said Boeing in April disclosed false stamping at its 787 plant in South Carolina by some employees.\n\nThe FAA said in May it was investigating after Boeing said some employees at the plant had committed \"misconduct\" by claiming some tests had been completed.\n\nBoeing also did not ensure work on airplanes was conducted in the proper sequence, the Justice Department said.\n\n\"Boeing senior executives prioritised the movement of aircraft through Boeing's factories over reducing out-of-sequence work to ensure production quality,\" the filing said.\n\n\"Out-of-sequence work is more difficult to perform (and) increases the risk that defects in manufacturing will occur,\" it added.\n\nThe Justice Department has a separate criminal probe ongoing into the Alaska Airlines jet that was missing four key bolts.\n\nBoeing has said no paperwork detailing the removal of the bolts was completed.\n\nAs part of the guilty plea deal, the plane maker agreed to spend at least $455 million (\u20ac419 million) over the next three years to boost safety and compliance programs, the filing said, adding that was 75% higher than Boeing's previously planned expenditures on its corporate compliance program.\n\nFamilies of those killed in the MAX crashes will be able to file objections within a week before Judge Reed O'Connor, who will decide whether to accept the deal and determine if Boeing owes restitution to the victims' relatives.\n\nBoeing's board will have to meet with the relatives within four months of sentencing, the filing added.\n\nThe deal also imposes an independent monitor, who will have to publicly file annual progress reports, to oversee the firm's compliance.\n\nBoeing will be on probation during the

The case reflects efforts by the Biden Administration to balance new punishments for a reeling titan of US industry with demands by grieving families for retribution.\n\nAs part of its plea agreement, which requires approval from the Texas federal judge overseeing the case, Boeing faces a fine of at least $243.6 million. That matches the amount it paid under a 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement that the Justice Department later determined the company had violated, the filing showed.\n\nThe company also will serve three years on probation. During that time, Boeing agreed to install an independent corporate monitor and to spend at least $455 million to bolster its compliance and safety programs, according to the filing.\n\n\"We will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen our safety, quality and compliance programs,\" a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe planemaker initially avoided charges for concealing information from the Federal Aviation Administration over changes to a system in the 737 Max jet that led to two crashes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. But in an unusual move, the Justice Department concluded in May that the company violated the 2021 deferred-prosecution deal-bsp-bb-link> -- a move that occurred after the in-flight blowout of a fuselage panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet on Jan. 5.\n\nAccording to the agreement, Boeing took considerable steps to enhance its anti-fraud compliance program as required by the 2021 deal, but the company ultimately failed to fully implement and test the program by the time the deal expired.\n\n\"As a result, the Department determined that Boeing's anti-fraud compliance program still has significant gaps,\" according to the filing.\n\nThe government also determined that Boeing failed to adopt policies and procedures to limit risks from \"out-of-sequence\" work done to correct earlier assembly of its aircraft. Such corrective work is more difficult to perform and can increase the risk of defects, prosecutors said.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2023, Boeing conducted safety assessments that identified out-of-sequence work that could result in the delivery of \"unairworthy\" aircraft to customers, the Justice Department said in the filing.\n\n\"Boeing senior executives prioritized the movement of aircraft through Boeing's factories over reducing out-of-sequence work to ensure production quality,\" according to the filing.\n\nUnder the agreement, Boeing is required to provide the monitor with access to all information, documents, records, facilities and employees it needs to evaluate whether the company's internal controls, record-keeping and policies are in compliance with US fraud laws.\n\nThe monitor's role will include assessing \"the Board of Directors' and senior management's commitment to, and effective implementation of, the corporate compliance program,\" according to the filing. The monitor will prepare a confidential annual report for the government, with an executive summary being made available to public in the court docket, the government said.\n\nAttorneys for the families of the crash victims plan to urge the judge to reject the new agreement. According to a court filing earlier this month, the families said they intend to argue that the plea deal \"unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 persons.\"\n\nUS District Judge , who is overseeing the case, has yet to decide if he'll hold a hearing on the plea deal.\n\nBy agreeing to plead guilty, Boeing will avoid the distraction of a criminal trial at a time when its finances are in disarray and its leadership is in limbo. The company has been in crisis mode since the near-catastrophic Alaska Airlines accident.\n\nThe case is US v. Boeing, 21-cr-005-bsp-bb-link>, US District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth).\n\n(Updates with details from the proposed agreement and a statement from Boeing.)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

fine of the same amount.\n\n\"We will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen our safety, quality and compliance programs,\" a spokesperson for the aircraft manufacturer told AFP while confirming the court filing.\n\nThe high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.\n\nBoeing violated the DPA \"by failing to sufficiently design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud laws throughout its operations,\" prosecutor said in court documents.\n\nBoeing conspired to defraud U.S. air traffic safety regulators about the Max 737 while the aircraft was being certified, according to the filing.\n\nBoeing admitted in April 2019 that anti-stall flight software was partly to blame in the crashes.\n\nTerms of the plea deal call for Boeing to serve three years of \"organizational probation\", conditions of which include having an independent monitor and investing at least $455 million on compliance, quality and safety programs, according to the filing.\n\nFacing families\n\nFamilies of crash victims have objected to the deal, arguing that it \"unfairly makes concessions to Boeing

plea deal.\n\nFamilies of victims declined to comment Wednesday but have said previously they will ask the court to reject the plea deal.\n\n\"The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises,\" said an objection filed by their legal team when word of the plea deal first surfaced.\n\nThe original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded U.S. aviation regulators.\n\nThat agreement required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\nA three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.\n\nBut in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.\n\nThe incident launched a new wave of scrutiny into Boeing's manufacturing and safety practices, with formal probes initiated by U.S. regulators and Congress.\n\nIn a May 14 letter to the court overseeing the MAX case, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by \"failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations.\"\n\nThe conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it had not violated the

An independent compliance monitor will also be appointed.\n\nThis is not a done deal until it is approved by US District Judge Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas, who can either approve the deal or reject it.\n\nAccording to court documents, \"the plea agreement will not provide Boeing with immunity for any other conduct, including any conduct that may be the subject of any ongoing or future Government investigation of the Company.\"\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said, \"Boeing and the Justice Department have filed a detailed plea agreement in federal court, which is subject to court approval.

The FAA said in May it was investigating after Boeing said some employees at the plant had committed \"misconduct\" by claiming some tests had been completed.\n\nBoeing also did not ensure work on airplanes was conducted in the proper sequence, the Justice Department said.\n\n\"Boeing senior executives prioritized the movement of aircraft through Boeing's factories over reducing out-of-sequence work to ensure production quality,\" the filing said. \"Out-of-sequence work is more difficult to perform (and) increases the risk that defects in manufacturing will occur.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has a separate criminal probe ongoing into the Alaska Airlines jet that was missing four key bolts. Boeing has said no paperwork detailing the removal of the bolts was completed.\n\nAs part of the guilty plea deal, the planemaker agreed to spend at least $455 million over the next three years to boost safety and compliance programs, said the filing, adding that was 75% higher than Boeing's previously planned expenditures on its corporate compliance program.\n\nFamilies of those killed in the MAX crashes will be able to file objections within a week before Judge Reed O'Connor, who will decide whether to accept the deal and determine if Boeing owes restitution to the victims' relatives.\n\nBoeing's board will have to meet with the relatives within four months of sentencing, the filing added.\n\nThe deal also imposes an independent monitor, who will have to publicly file annual progress reports, to oversee the firm's compliance. Boeing will be on probation during the monitor's three-year term and it can be extended by a year if Boeing does not comply with the terms.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson, Allison Lampert and Chris Prentice; Editing by Chris Reese and Jamie Freed)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_prosecution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deferred prosecution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/6e/26e543b1-1e70-5773-a356-0dd2c64e19af/66a189cd79de7.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C52&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761245", "eventUri": "eng-9761245", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 559, "textEnd": 565}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

crashes", "body": "Boeing will plead guilty to fraud as part of a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, according to a court filing Wednesday.\n\nThe agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which a total of 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.\n\nThe plea deal must be approved by a federal court judge and it includes an additional $243.6 million to be paid by Boeing on top of a previous fine of the same amount.\n\nThe high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.\n\nBoeing violated the DPA \"by failing to sufficiently design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of US fraud laws throughout its operations,\" prosecutor said in court documents.\n\nTerms of the plea deal call for Boeing to serve three years of \"organizational probation\", conditions of which include having an independent monitor and investing at least $455 million on compliance, quality and safety programs, according to the filing.\n\nFamilies of crash victims have objected to the deal, arguing that it \"unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive.\"\n\nThe company's board of directors will be required to meet the families of victims of the crashes in 2018 and 2019 under terms of the plea deal.\n\nFamilies of victims have said they will ask the court to reject the plea deal.\n\n\"The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises,\" said an objection filed by their legal team when word of the plea deal first surfaced.\n\nThe original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded US aviation regulators.\n\nThat agreement required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\nA three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.\n\nBut in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.\n\nThe incident launched a new wave of scrutiny into Boeing's manufacturing and safety practices, with formal probes initiated by US regulators and Congress.\n\nIn a May 14 letter to the court overseeing the MAX case, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by \"failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations.\"\n\nThe conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it had not violated the 2021 agreement.\n\ngc-elm/jgc", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType":

The plea agreement entails Boeing paying a $243.6 million fine.\n\nThe charges stem from accusations that Boeing knowingly provided false information about the 737 MAX's flight handling software, which was a significant factor in two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that collectively resulted in the deaths of 346 people, Reuters reported.

A two-time PGA Tour winner, Murray died on Saturday at 30 years old. \u201cWe have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone,\u201d Eric and Terry Murray said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It\u2019s a nightmare. \u201cWe have so many questions that have no answers. But one. \u201cWas Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and \u2014 it seems \u2014 by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and will be missed. \u201cWe would like to thank the PGA Tour and the entire world of gold for the outpouring of support. Life wasn\u2019t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now. \u201cPlease respect out privacy as we work through this incredible tragedy, and please honor Grayson by being kind to one another. If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else.\u201d If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org.", "summary": "A two-time PGA Tour winner, Murray died on Saturday at 30 years old.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/sports/grayson-murrays-parents-reveal-he-died-by-suicide/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/grayson-murray-united-states-hits-82729354.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:06:26", "author": "Jared Schwartz", "authors": ["Jared Schwartz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.149}

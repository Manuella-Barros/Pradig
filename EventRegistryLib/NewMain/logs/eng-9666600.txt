Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. The following is AP's previous story:\n\nTropical Storm Alberto rumbled toward northeast Mexico on Thursday as the first named storm of the season, carrying heavy rains that left three people dead. But Alberto also brought hope to a region suffering under a prolonged, severe drought.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.\n\nMart\u00ednez Barba reported from Mexico City.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of the hurricane season. (AP Photo/Fabian Melendez)\n\nTropical Storm Alberto rumbled toward northeast Mexico on Thursday as the first named storm of the season, carrying heavy rains that left three people dead. But Alberto also brought hope to a region suffering under a prolonged, severe drought.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Samuel Garcia said people should avoid leaving the house when it is raining and workers were ready to address possible impacts on the electricity grid, water and sewage systems.\n\nIn the United States as far as Louisiana, videos showed flooded coastal towns and water smashing into sea walls, while in Tamaulipas, videos shared on social media showed ominous gray skies as forecasters warned Alberto could bring waves as high as 20 feet.\n\nAcross the Gulf on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, local news outlets filmed strong winds and heavy rainfall, after authorities recorded as much as 4 1/2 inches in the last day.\n\nThe NHC predicted \"moderate coastal flooding\" along much of the Texas coast through Thursday, while Mexican forecasters expect further weekend rains in the south from another formation over the Caribbean.\n\nForecasters have warned that this year's Atlantic hurricane season will likely be highly active due to impacts from the La Nina weather pattern and warmer ocean waters.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score":

Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAlso Read | Malaysia Airlines Flight Carrying 138 Passengers Make Emergency Landing at Hyderabad Airport After Takeoff Due to Technical Snag Mid-Air (Watch Video).\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimetres) to 10 inches (25 centimetres) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimetres) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto had rumbled toward northeast Mexico as the first named storm of the season, carrying heavy rains that left three people dead. But the storm also brought hope to a region suffering under a prolonged, severe drought.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometres) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometres) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Centre. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe US National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimetres) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimetres) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.

Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMart\u00ednez Barba reported from Mexico City.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station"},

Jon Shapley/Houston Chronicle via AP\n\nTAMPICO, Mexico -- Tropical Storm Alberto, the season's first named storm, weakened Thursday as it moved inland over northeast Mexico after bringing heavy rains to parts of the parched region and leaving at least three dead.\n\nThe storm was weakening rapidly over land and was downgraded to a tropical depression by the U.S. National Hurricane Center with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. Coastal storm watches and warnings in Mexico were lifted as Alberto moved west at 18 mph.\n\nBut forecasters said heavy rain amounting to several inches was still expected inland in Mexico's Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Coahuila states. South Texas was forecast to see diminishing rain Thursday.\n\nImmediately after it moved ashore in Tampico, there was initial disappointment at the meager amount of rain that fell. Showers had been sporadic through the early morning with the sun even breaking through at times.\n\n\"We had hoped that it would come because water is so needed here, but at far as I can tell it went somewhere else,\" said Tampico resident Marta Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nThe rain that Tampico had hoped for may still be coming from some of the large system's outer bands. There was heavy rain reported inland in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains.

Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nAlberto had spurred tropical storm warnings covering most of the western Gulf of Mexico's coastline from Texas to Veracruz. The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph.\n\nSchools were closed across Tamaulipas state where Alberto came ashore and would be through Friday. Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches to 10 inches of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the hurricane center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nMexican authorities had downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit.

The storm, with sustained winds of 50 mph, is expected to make landfall in Tamaulipas and bring significant flash flooding, coastal flooding, and possible mudslides.\n\nThe outer edges of Tropical Storm Alberto began to unleash heavy rains over parts of northeastern Mexico near the U.S. border late on Wednesday as the large tropical system closed in on the Gulf coast, killing at least three people. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), the storm was located about 135 miles (217 km) east of the Mexican port of Tampico, packing maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph), as military and emergency services personnel braced for its full impact.\n\nAlberto is the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, though its sustained wind speeds remain below hurricane strength. The deaths of at least three people, all minors, have been attributed to Alberto, Nuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia told local media. He did not give any details.\n\nOne of the victims has been identified as a 15-year-old boy who was swept away by the current of a river and drowned outside the city of Monterrey, Mexico's third biggest, in Nuevo Leon state, according to a report from the city's emergency services. The NHC noted some \"slight strengthening\" is possible over Wednesday night.\n\nThe center of Alberto is expected to make landfall along the coast of Mexico's Tamaulipas state, just south of the U.S. state of Texas, early Thursday morning. While it will likely weaken quickly, it is also seen bringing torrential rainfall, coastal flooding and strong winds. The NHC warned of considerable flash flooding in the storm's path, including in urban areas, along with swollen rivers and potential mudslides.\n\nMexico's national water commission Conagua also issued a warning for overflowing rivers, landslides and flooding. Governor Garcia encouraged his state's residents to avoid leaving their homes amid heavy rainfall and said preparations were in place to quickly address possible impacts to local power supplies, water and sewage systems.\n\nAlong the U.S. Gulf coast, including parts of Texas and Louisiana, videos posted on social media showed some flooding in coastal towns and waves smashing into sea walls. The NHC also cited the possibility of further coastal flooding along with the formation of tornadoes in Texas linked to Alberto.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

Coastal storm watches and warnings in Mexico were lifted as Alberto moved west at 18 mph (30 kmh).\n\nBut forecasters said heavy rain amounting to several inches was still expected inland in Mexico's Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Coahuila states. South Texas was forecast to see diminishing rain Thursday.\n\nImmediately after it moved ashore in Tampico, there was initial disappointment at the meager amount of rain that fell. Showers had been sporadic through the early morning with the sun even breaking through at times.\n\n\"We had hoped that it would come because water is so needed here, but at far as I can tell it went somewhere else,\" said Tampico resident Marta Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nThe rain that Tampico had hoped for may still be coming from some of the large system's outer bands. There was heavy rain reported inland in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon.\n\nThere, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nAlberto had spurred tropical storm warnings covering most of the western Gulf of Mexico's coastline from Texas to Veracruz. The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kmh).\n\nSchools were closed across Tamaulipas state where Alberto came ashore and would be through Friday. Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the hurricane center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nMexican authorities had downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nTampico resident Octavio Gonz\u00e1lez was visibly disappointed in the little rain from Alberto.\n\n\"Very little water fell,\" he said. \"We're on this south side of Tamaulipas with a lot of drought.

Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. The following is AP's previous story:\n\nTropical Storm Alberto rumbled toward northeast Mexico on Thursday as the first named storm of the season, carrying heavy rains that left three people dead. But Alberto also brought hope to a region suffering under a prolonged, severe drought.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "dailypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type":

A 15-year-old boy was swept away by the current of a river and drowned outside the city of Monterrey, Mexico's third biggest, in Nuevo Leon state, according to local emergency services.\n\nThe NHC noted some \"slight strengthening\" is possible over Wednesday night.\n\nThe center of Alberto is expected to make landfall along the coast of Mexico's Tamaulipas state, just south of the U.S. state of Texas, early Thursday morning. While it will likely weaken quickly, it is also seen bringing torrential rainfall, coastal flooding and strong winds.\n\nThe NHC warned of considerable flash flooding in the storm's path, including in urban areas, along with swollen rivers and potential mudslides.\n\nMexico's national water commission Conagua also issued a warning for overflowing rivers, landslides and flooding.\n\nNuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia encouraged area residents to avoid leaving their homes when it is raining and that preparations were in place to quickly address possible impacts to local power supplies, water and sewage systems.\n\nAlong the U.S. Gulf coast, including parts of Texas and Louisiana, videos posted on social media showed some flooding in coastal towns and waves smashing into sea walls.\n\nThe NHC also cited the possibility of further coastal flooding along with the formation of tornadoes in Texas linked to Alberto.\n\n(Reporting by Stephanie Hamel and Sarah Morland; Additional reporting by

Abbott declares state of emergency", "body": "Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the hurricane season, rumbled ashore making landfall in Tampico, Mexico early Thursday morning. Texas began mobilizing Wednesday as South Texas and the coast received heavy rainfall and tropical force winds and coastal flooding.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 51 counties, paving the way for local officials and emergency response to the impacts of Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nOn Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\n\"Just the wave, just blow you away. It's mind-boggling,\" said Kevin Hoffstrom who was visiting the Texas coast from Illinois.\n\nResidents along the coast said they were using Alberto as a practice run for what's forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\n\"We thought it was going to be worse than what it is. And we, you know, put batteries in our flashlights. We, you know, had our cell phones charged and our battery banks filled and did all that just in case, because you never know,\" said Corpus Christi resident Lana Montuori.\n\nThe Texas National Guard has three platoons of more than 40 personnel in total alongside 20 vehicles deployed to the region.\n\nNorth Texas first responders have begun mobilizing to help along the Texas coast.\n\nFirefighters with the North Richland Hills Fire Department deployed to Victoria to help with response to TS Alberto.\n\nMeanwhile, the Flower Mound Fire Department said its Ambulance Bus \"AmBus\" is staged in Weslaco.\n\nThe AmBus is part of the Texas Department of State Health Services network of first responders that can be mobilized wherever needed to help with everything from hospital evacuations to mass casualty incidents as well as providing on-site medical services for first responders.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit.\n\nQuiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nIn nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains.\n\nThey said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nSome higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was

Coastal storm watches and warnings in Mexico were lifted as Alberto moved west at 18 mph (30 kmh).\n\nBut forecasters said heavy rain amounting to several inches was still expected inland in Mexico's Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Coahuila states. South Texas was forecast to see diminishing rain Thursday.\n\nImmediately after it moved ashore in Tampico, there was initial disappointment at the meager amount of rain that fell. Showers had been sporadic through the early morning with the sun even breaking through at times.\n\n\"We had hoped that it would come because water is so needed here, but at far as I can tell it went somewhere else,\" said Tampico resident Marta Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nThe rain that Tampico had hoped for may still be coming from some of the large system's outer bands. There was heavy rain reported inland in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon.\n\nThere, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nAlberto had spurred tropical storm warnings covering most of the western Gulf of Mexico's coastline from Texas to Veracruz. The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kmh).\n\nSchools were closed across Tamaulipas state where Alberto came ashore and would be through Friday. Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the hurricane center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nMexican authorities had downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn the village of Surfside Beach, a Texas city on a barrier island, storm surge early Thursday left behind some damaged roads and lots of debris, but \"very little damage\" to the mostly elevated structures, Mayor Gregg Bisso said.\n\nThe surge was receding by late morning and \"you can almost get around now,\" he said. Bisso said the island has a population of about 800 full-time residents with as many as 10,000 vacationers in the summer.\n\nTampico resident Octavio Gonz\u00e1lez was visibly disappointed in the little rain from Alberto.\n\n\"Very little water fell,\" he said. \"We're on this south side of Tamaulipas with a lot of drought.

Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city\u00b4s waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto\u00b4s arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we\u00b4re now getting, thank God. Let\u00b4s hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico\u00b4s Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.\n\nMart\u00ednez Barba reported from Mexico City.\n\nA car sits submerged in water as Tropical Storm Alberto approaches land Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Surfside Beach, Texas.

The storm was located about 135 miles (217 km) east of the Mexican port of Tampico, packing maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 kph), the Miami-based forecaster said, as military and emergency services personnel braced for its full impact.\n\nAlberto is the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, though its sustained wind speeds remain below hurricane strength. At least one death has already been attributed to Alberto. A 15-year-old boy was swept away by the current of a river and drowned outside the city of Monterrey, Mexico's third biggest, in Nuevo Leon state, according to local emergency services.\n\nThe NHC noted some \"slight strengthening\" is possible over Wednesday night. The center of Alberto is expected to make landfall along the coast of Mexico's Tamaulipas state, just south of the U.S. state of Texas, early Thursday morning. While it will likely weaken quickly, it is also seen bringing torrential rainfall, coastal flooding and strong winds.\n\nThe NHC warned of considerable flash flooding in the storm's path, including in urban areas, along with swollen rivers and potential mudslides. Mexico's national water commission Conagua also issued a warning for overflowing rivers, landslides and flooding.\n\nNuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia encouraged area residents to avoid leaving their homes when it is raining and that preparations were in place to quickly address possible impacts to local power supplies, water and sewage systems. Along the U.S. Gulf coast, including parts of Texas and Louisiana, videos posted on social media showed some flooding in coastal towns and waves smashing into sea walls.\n\nThe NHC also cited the possibility of further coastal flooding along with the formation of tornadoes in Texas linked to Alberto.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.

Abbott declares state of emergency", "body": "Tropical Storm Alberto rumbled toward northeast Mexico early Thursday as the first named storm of the season, Texas began mobilizing as South Texas and the coast received heavy rainfall and tropical force winds and coastal flooding.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour and expected to make landfall Thursday morning.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 51 counties, paving the way for local officials and emergency response to the impacts of Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nOn Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\n\"Just the wave, just blow you away. It's mind-boggling,\" said Kevin Hoffstrom who was visiting the Texas coast from Illinois.\n\nResidents along the coast said they were using Alberto as a practice run for what's forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\n\"We thought it was going to be worse than what it is. And we, you know, put batteries in our flashlights. We, you know, had our cell phones charged and our battery banks filled and did all that just in case, because you never know,\" said Corpus Christi resident Lana Montuori.\n\nThe Texas National Guard has three platoons of more than 40 personnel in total alongside 20 vehicles deployed to the region.\n\nNorth Texas first responders have begun mobilizing to help along the Texas coast.\n\nFirefighters with the North Richland Hills Fire Department deployed to Victoria to help with response to TS Alberto.\n\nMeanwhile, the Flower Mound Fire Department said its Ambulance Bus \"AmBus\" is staged in Weslaco.\n\nThe AmBus is part of the Texas Department of State Health Services network of first responders that can be mobilized wherever needed to help with everything from hospital evacuations to mass casualty incidents as well as providing on-site medical services for first responders.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit.\n\nQuiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nIn nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains.\n\nThey said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nSome higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Coastal storm watches and warnings in Mexico were lifted as Alberto moved west at 18 mph (30 kmh).\n\nAlso Read | Germany's Habeck Navigates Delicate China Mission.\n\nBut forecasters said heavy rain amounting to several inches was still expected inland in Mexico's Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Coahuila states.

There was heavy rain reported inland in the neighbouring state of Nuevo Leon.\n\nThere, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains.

The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kmh).\n\nSchools were closed across Tamaulipas state where Alberto came ashore and would be through Friday. Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the hurricane centre.

But Alberto also brought hope to a region suffering under a prolonged, severe drought.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMart\u00ednez Barba reported from Mexico City.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news",

showed flooded coastal towns and water smashing into sea walls, while in Tamaulipas, videos shared on social media showed ominous gray skies as forecasters warned Alberto could bring waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters).\n\nAcross the Gulf on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, local news outlets filmed strong winds and heavy rainfall, after authorities recorded as much as 192 millimeters in the last day.\n\nThe NHC predicted \"moderate coastal flooding\" along much of the Texan coast through Thursday, while Mexican forecasters expect further weekend rains in the south from another formation over the Caribbean.\n\nForecasters have warned that this year's Atlantic hurricane season will likely be highly active due to impacts from the La Nina weather pattern and warmer ocean waters.\n\n(Reporting

Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (510 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over land and dissipate Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fortune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

REUTERS/Yahir Ceballos\n\nTropical Storm Alberto rumbled toward northeast Mexico early Thursday as the first named storm of the season, carrying heavy rains that left three people dead but also brought hope to a region suffering under a prolonged, severe drought.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs, The Associated Press said.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alberto was located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving west at 13 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe US National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nIn Mexico, residents expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas as there could be localized flooding.\n\nAs much as 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was casting rain showers on both sides of the border, extending up much of the south Texas coast and south to Mexico's Veracruz state.\n\nAlberto was expected to rapidly weaken over

Showers had been sporadic through the early morning with the sun even breaking through at times.\n\n\"We had hoped that it would come because water is so needed here, but at far as I can tell it went somewhere else,\" said Tampico resident Marta Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nThe rain that Tampico had hoped for may still be coming from some of the large system's outer bands. There was heavy rain reported inland in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon.\n\nThere, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAlberto had spurred tropical storm warnings covering most of the western Gulf of Mexico's coastline from Texas to Veracruz. The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kmh).\n\nSchools were closed across Tamaulipas state where Alberto came ashore and would be through Friday. Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the hurricane center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nMexican authorities had downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The (wind) speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" said Tamaulipas state Secretary of Hydrological Resources Ra\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez during a news conference late Wednesday. Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there was \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas, with possible tornadoes or waterspouts.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast saw some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nBut Bert Dagnon, who closed his Salt Water Gift Shop in Galveston on Wednesday out of an abundance of caution, said it didn't rain as much as predicted and there was little impact in the area aside from flooding in low-lying areas.\n\n\"I suspect everybody will pick up, mop up and move on,\" he said Thursday, adding that he'd already had customers as skies turned partly sunny at the beach.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Surfside Beach, a Texas city on a barrier island, storm surge early Thursday left behind some damaged roads and lots of debris, but \"very little damage\" to the mostly elevated structures, Mayor Gregg Bisso said.\n\nThe surge was receding by late morning and \"you can almost get around now,\" he said. Bisso said the island has a population of about 800 full-time residents with as many as 10,000 vacationers in the summer.\n\nTampico resident Octavio Gonz\u00e1lez was visibly disappointed in the little rain from Alberto.\n\n\"Very little water fell,\" he said. \"We're on this south side of Tamaulipas with a lot of drought.

Storm Alberto rumbled toward northeast Mexico early yesterday as the first named storm of the season, carrying heavy rains that left three people dead, but also brought hope to a region that had a prolonged, severe drought.\n\nMexican authorities downplayed the risk posed by Alberto and instead pinned their hopes on its ability to ease the parched region's water needs.\n\n\"The [wind] speeds are not such as to consider it a risk,\" Tamaulipas State Secretary of Hydrological Resources Raul Quiroga Alvarez said during a news conference late on Wednesday.\n\nHe suggested people greet Alberto happily.\n\n\"This is what we've been waiting for eight years in all of Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nMuch of Mexico has been experiencing severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit.\n\nQuiroga said that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the US a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nHowever, in nearby Nuevo Leon State, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains.\n\nOne man died in the La Silla river in Monterrey and two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende, they said.\n\nLocal media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Governor Samuel Garcia wrote on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday yesterday when Alberto has passed.\n\nLate on Wednesday, Alberto was about 64km east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 402km south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 85kph, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAlberto brought rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type":

South Texas was forecast to see diminishing rain Thursday.\n\nImmediately after it moved ashore in Tampico, there was initial disappointment at the meager amount of rain that fell. Showers had been sporadic through the early morning with the sun even breaking through at times.\n\n\"We had hoped that it would come because water is so needed here, but at far as I can tell it went somewhere else,\" said Tampico resident Marta Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nBut inland heavy rain was causing damage in the neighboring states of Nuevo Leon and Veracruz.\n\nThere, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nWater also washed out a segment of a major highway connecting Monterrey and Saltillo.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passed.\n\nTo the south in the state of Veracruz, 24 families were left homeless in the state capital of Xalapa after days of heavy rain collapsed a retaining wall onto three buildings.\n\nAt dawn, residents heard a deafening sound and the floor began to move.\n\n\"I thought it was an earthquake,\" said Pedro Luna S\u00e1nchez, who had owned an apartment in one of the buildings for 26 years. \"I looked out the window and saw my neighbor calling for help. I looked more closely and saw the wall was on top of the buildings.\"\n\nAll residents were able to escape safely.\n\nAlberto had spurred tropical storm warnings covering most of the western Gulf of Mexico's coastline from Texas to Veracruz. The storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kmh).\n\nSchools were closed across Tamaulipas state where Alberto came ashore and would be through Friday. Shelters were prepared across the state to receive residents trying to escape high water.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some parts of northeast Mexico and southern Texas, with even higher isolated totals possible, according to the hurricane center. Some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. Areas along the Texas coast saw some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts were spotted offshore.\n\nThe mayor of Corpus Christi, Texas, planned to request a disaster declaration after parts of the city were drenched with up to 6 inches of rain on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said. Residents reported water and wind damage, and canals were damaged on the north side of Padre Island, Brianna Sandoval said Thursday.\n\nTwo people were rescued from vehicles that stalled over flooded roads, and a downed powerline rerouted highway traffic for part of the morning. The city remained under a flood warning.\n\nBert Dagnon, who closed his Salt Water Gift Shop in Galveston on Wednesday out of an abundance of caution, said it didn't rain as much as predicted and there was little impact in the area aside from flooding in low-lying areas.\n\n\"I suspect everybody will pick up, mop up and move on,\" he said Thursday, adding that he'd already had customers as skies turned partly sunny at the beach.\n\nIn Surfside Beach, a Texas city on a barrier island, storm surge early Thursday left behind some damaged roads and lots of debris, but \"very little damage\" to the mostly elevated structures, Mayor Gregg Bisso said.\n\nThe surge was receding by late morning and \"you can almost get around now,\" he said. Bisso said the island has a population of about 800 full-time residents with as many as 10,000 vacationers in the summer.\n\nTampico resident Octavio Gonz\u00e1lez was visibly disappointed in the little rain from Alberto.\n\n\"Very little water fell,\" he said. \"We're on this south side of Tamaulipas with a lot of drought. And the truth is we have a lot of hope for the rain.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jamie Stengle in Dallas; Valerie Gonzalez in McAllen, Texas; and Alba Alem\u00e1n in Xalapa, Mexico,

The Mexican authorities noted three fatalities due to the storm's heavy downpours.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico early Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric ministration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nCivil protection authorities in the northern state of Nuevo Leon said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital. They also said that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto had passed.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Wednesday that Alberto was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (510 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced Wednesday afternoon that authorities had activated a command center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\n___ AP journalists Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Julie Walker in New York contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType":

Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende.

By Thursday morning, civil protection had reported a fourth death due to an electric shock, local media reported.\n\nOne of the victims was later identified by emergency services as a 15-year-old boy swept away by a current outside Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city.\n\nIn both Nuevo Leon, where Alberto filled up the Santa Catarina river, causing it to break its banks, and in the coastal Tamaulipas state, local authorities moved people into temporary shelters and paused public activities.\n\nThe storm, however, brought much-needed rain across swathes of Mexico, where some of its reservoirs had water levels as low as 8% due to an extended drought and summer heat wave.\n\nNuevo Leon state authorities said they would redirect water from La Boca dam as it neared its maximum capacity of around 40 million cubic meters due to Alberto, after water authorities said a day earlier it was just 35% full.\n\nBrett Anderson, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said on Thursday that due to climate change the types of extreme heat and drought conditions Mexico has experienced will become the new normal, trapping pollutants and drying up the water cycle.\n\nMexico has since March experienced temperatures 5.2\u00b0C (9.4\u00b0F) above the historical average and received barely over a third of the normal rainfall for this period, Anderson added. \"Climate change is clearly playing a role in enhancing this warming.\"\n\nClimate change is also expected to contribute to more storms over the Atlantic this hurricane season, as warmer ocean waters allow powerful storms to intensify more rapidly.\n\n\"The climate crisis is making extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms more frequent and severe,\" said Save the Children regional advisor Moa Cortobius. Some 35 million children are living in exposed areas and are at risk this season in the Atlantic, she added.\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Alberto would continue to bring heavy rains and flooding across parts of northeastern Mexico, likely producing \"considerable flash and urban flooding\" and possibly life-threatening mudslides.\n\nIt warned that much of the Texas coastline could continue to see moderate flooding through the morning.\n\nThe storm made landfall earlier on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and is churning west across the country at 18 miles per hour (30 kph), packing maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph), the NHC said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been (hoping) for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought conditions, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla River in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto has passes.\n\nPeople in Mexico expressed hope for Alberto bringing rain.\n\nBlanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico, ventured out to the city's waterfront Wednesday to await Alberto's arrival.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Coronel Moral. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nAuthorities closed schools for the remainder of the week in Tamaulipas since there could be localized flooding.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A day earlier, water authorities said it was just 35% full.\n\nThe U.S. hurricane center said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas was flooding from excess rain and minor coastal floods from storm surge.

The storm resulted in four deaths, including three children, and exacerbated existing drought conditions, underscoring the impact of climate change.\n\nAlberto, the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, has weakened into a tropical depression as it moves inland over northeastern Mexico, bringing more heavy rains and flooding after leaving four dead, including three children.\n\nThe governor of Mexico's Nuevo Leon state told local media late Wednesday that at least three people under 18 had died due to the storm. By Thursday morning, civil protection had reported a fourth death due to an electric shock, local media reported. One of the victims was later identified by emergency services as a 15-year-old boy swept away by a current outside Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city.\n\nIn both Nuevo Leon, where Alberto filled up the Santa Catarina river, causing it to break its banks, and in the coastal Tamaulipas state, local authorities moved people into temporary shelters and paused public activities. The storm, however, brought much-needed rain across swathes of Mexico, where some of its reservoirs had water levels as low as 8% due to an extended drought and summer heat wave.\n\nNuevo Leon state authorities said they would redirect water from La Boca dam as it neared its maximum capacity of around 40 million cubic meters due to Alberto, after water authorities said a day earlier it was just 35% full. Brett Anderson, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said on Thursday that due to climate change the types of extreme heat and drought conditions Mexico has experienced will become the new normal, trapping pollutants and drying up the water cycle.\n\nMexico has since March experienced temperatures 5.2\u00b0C (9.4\u00b0F) above the historical average and received barely over a third of the normal rainfall for this period, Anderson added. \"Climate change is clearly playing a role in enhancing this warming.\" Climate change is also expected to contribute to more storms over the Atlantic this hurricane season, as warmer ocean waters allow powerful storms to intensify more rapidly.\n\n\"The climate crisis is making extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms more frequent and severe,\" said Save the Children regional advisor Moa Cortobius. Some 35 million children are living in exposed areas and are at risk this season in the Atlantic, she added. The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Alberto would continue to bring heavy rains and flooding across parts of northeastern Mexico, likely producing \"considerable flash and urban flooding\" and possibly life-threatening mudslides.\n\nIt warned that much of the Texas coastline could continue to see moderate flooding through the morning. The storm made landfall earlier on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and is churning west across the country at 18 miles per hour (30 kph), packing maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph), the NHC said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Storm warnings and coastal watches were discontinued, however, even though wind and rain extend far from the storm's center.\n\nStranded passengers being rescued from a bus in Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Thursday morning after flash flooding caused by Tropical Storm Alberto filled the Santa Mar\u00eda Industrial Park.\n\nPreviously, the system was flagged as a potential tropical cyclone when it moved through the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the most intense rains were occurring in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and San Luis Potos\u00ed, according to Mexico's National Meteorological Service (SMN). Rain totals of 13 to 25 centimeters were expected at higher elevations, which could lead to reduced visibility, landslides, flooding and rising rivers and streams.\n\nVery heavy rains (75 to 150 millimeters) are expected in Durango, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Quer\u00e9taro, Hidalgo, Puebla, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas.\n\nIn Chiapas, four portions of roadway were rendered impassable Thursday due to landslides and flooding, with emergency services unable to immediately reach the affected areas due to heavy rains. In Veracruz, a landslide dropped huge boulders onto one stretch of roadway, and a sinkhole developed in the capital city of Xalapa.\n\nMany other states across Mexico will experience some amount of Alberto-related rain on Thursday, ranging from heavy rains to occasional showers.\n\nAlberto was named a tropical storm on Wednesday, leading to the suspension of classes in several regions and the implementation of other safety preparations.\n\nFootage of the Santa Catarina river in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, around 1 p.m. Thursday, being lashed by heavy rains from Alberto. (Webcams de M\u00e9xico)\n\nBut it weakened rapidly after making landfall early Thursday morning. By 9 a.m., it was downgraded to a tropical depression when it was located 155 kilometers west of Tampico, Tamaulipas.\n\nMaximum sustained winds were 75 km/h when Alberto made landfall, but then they slowed to 55 km/h.\n\nInitially, there was some chagrin in Tampico that the amount of rainfall was low and wouldn't put much of a dent in Mexico's ongoing drought, reported the Associated Press (AP).\n\n\"We had hoped that it would come because water is so needed here, but at far as I can tell, it went somewhere else,\" Tampico resident Marta Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez told AP.\n\nHowever, the outer bands of the system will likely bring the heavier rains that other areas experienced Thursday morning.\n\nIn Nuevo Le\u00f3n, civil protection authorities have linked three deaths to Alberto's heavy rains. A 16-year-old in Monterrey died in a river, trapped by the currents when he attempted to retrieve a soccer ball, and two 12-year-olds in the state were electrocuted in the municipality of Allende when they rode their bikes through a large puddle that was in contact with a live wire.\n\nNuevo Le\u00f3n Governor Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on the social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday.\n\nIn Tamaulipas and Veracruz, officials closed all schools on Thursday (and some on Friday), and shelters were prepared in case residents would need to flee high waters.\n\nAreas at higher elevations could see as much as 50 cm of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\nRa\u00fal Quiroga \u00c1lvarez, the Tamaulipas state minister of hydrological resources, said at a press conference Wednesday night that because the wind speeds were not \"a risk,\" his drought-ravaged state was actually looking forward to all the rain.\n\n\"This is what we've been waiting for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas,\" he said. \"This is a win-win event.\"\n\nIn his Thursday morning press conference, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said that members of the armed forces had been deployed in the storm areas to address possible damage.\n\nForecasters have predicted that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season could be much more active than usual, with 17 to 25 predicted named storms this year. On average, there are 14 named storms per season.\n\nThe U.S. Hurricane Center currently is monitoring a broad area of low pressure that's forming in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.", "source":

Workers were ready to address the possible impact of strong winds and rain on the electrical grid, water supplies, and sewage, he said.\n\nAcross the Gulf on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, local media reported strong winds and torrential rains. Some authorities, however, said the storm could help fill the country's dams, depleted by an extended drought.\n\nThe NHC predicted 'moderate coastal flooding' along much of the Texan coast through Thursday as southern areas experience tropical storm conditions.\n\nForecasters have warned that this year's Atlantic hurricane season will likely be highly active because of impacts from the La Nina weather pattern and warmer ocean water.\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada.

REUTERS/Daniel Becerril\n\n(Reuters) -Alberto, the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, has weakened into a tropical depression as it moves inland over northeastern Mexico, bringing more heavy rains and flooding after leaving four dead, including three children.\n\nThe governor of Mexico's Nuevo Leon state told local media late Wednesday that at least three people under 18 had died due to the storm. By Thursday morning, civil protection had reported a fourth death due to an electric shock, local media reported.\n\nOne of the victims was later identified by emergency services as a 15-year-old boy swept away by a current outside Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city.\n\nIn both Nuevo Leon, where Alberto filled up the Santa Catarina river, causing it to break its banks, and in the coastal Tamaulipas state, local authorities moved people into temporary shelters and paused public activities.\n\nThe storm, however, brought much-needed rain across swathes of Mexico, where some of its reservoirs had water levels as low as 8% due to an extended drought and summer heat wave.\n\nNuevo Leon state authorities said they would redirect water from La Boca dam as it neared its maximum capacity of around 40 million cubic meters due to Alberto, after water authorities said a day earlier it was just 35% full.\n\nBrett Anderson, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said on Thursday that due to climate change the types of extreme heat and drought conditions Mexico has experienced will become the new normal, trapping pollutants and drying up the water cycle.\n\nMexico has since March experienced temperatures 5.2\u00b0C (9.4\u00b0F) above the historical average and received barely over a third of the normal rainfall for this period, Anderson added. \"Climate change is clearly playing a role in enhancing this warming.\"\n\nClimate change is also expected to contribute to more storms over the Atlantic this hurricane season, as warmer ocean waters allow powerful storms to intensify more rapidly.\n\n\"The climate crisis is making extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms more frequent and severe,\" said Save the Children regional advisor Moa Cortobius. Some 35 million children are living in exposed areas and are at risk this season in the Atlantic, she added.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Alberto would continue to bring heavy rains and flooding across parts of northeastern Mexico, likely producing \"considerable flash and urban flooding\" and possibly life-threatening mudslides.\n\nIt warned that much of the Texas coastline could continue to see moderate flooding through the morning.\n\nThe storm made landfall earlier on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and is churning west across the country at 18 miles per hour (30 kph), packing maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph), the NHC said.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah Morland, Natalia Siniawski and Kylie Madry; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Rod Nickel and

While Texas sees relief, northeastern Mexico faces coastal flooding, flash floods, and river flooding. With three fatalities already reported, local governments are taking action to protect residents, relocating 92 people to shelters.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is moving inland over Mexico's coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Thursday, with heavy rains and gusty winds subsiding for Texas but continuing in northeastern Mexico. The coastal flooding threat remains for Texas, and tropical storm conditions are expected in the Mexican region, according to the NHC.\n\nThe center said that Alberto's rainfall will lessen in southern Texas but keep impacting Central America and northeastern Mexico, potentially causing flash and urban flooding, as well as new and renewed river flooding. Earlier reports from Mexico's National Water Commission (Conagua) predicted Alberto's landfall on the coasts of Tamaulipas and Veracruz states. The storm has already caused significant rainfall in northeastern Mexico, leading to three fatalities.\n\nAs Alberto approaches, the Nuevo Leon state government had relocated 92 people to shelters and paused public activities due to the forecasted weather conditions.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuevo_Le\u00f3n", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuevo Le\u00f3n"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuevo Le\u00f3n"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamaulipas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamaulipas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamaulipas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracruz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veracruz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veracruz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Corporate_Relocation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Corporate Relocation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/19_06_2024_15_04_33_3537755.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666600", "eventUri": "eng-9666600", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Instead, he suggested people greet Alberto happily. \"This is what we've been for for eight years in all of Tamaulipas.\"\n\nMuch of Mexico has been suffering under severe drought, with northern Mexico especially hard hit. Quiroga noted that the state's reservoirs were low and Mexico owed the United States a massive water debt in their shared use of the Rio Grande.\n\n\"This is a win-win event for Tamaulipas,\" he said.\n\nBut in nearby Nuevo Leon state, civil protection authorities reported three deaths linked to Alberto's rains. They said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital, and that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain. Alberto was bringing rains and flooding to the coast of Texas as well.\n\nThe US National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday the NWS said there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas.

The storm made landfall earlier on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and is churning west across the country at 18 miles per hour (30 kph), packing maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph), the NHC said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuevo_Le\u00f3n", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuevo Le\u00f3n"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuevo Le\u00f3n"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monterrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monterrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Catarina (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Catarina (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mudflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamaulipas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamaulipas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamaulipas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/19_06_2024_15_04_33_3537755.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666600", "eventUri": "eng-9666600", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

By Thursday morning, civil protection had reported a fourth death due to an electric shock, local media reported.\n\nOne of the victims was later identified by emergency services as a 15-year-old boy swept away by a current outside Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city in Nuevo Leon state, where the Santa Catarina river swelled and broke its banks.\n\nThe storm, however, brought much-needed rain across swathes of Mexico, where some of its reservoirs had water levels as low as 8% due to an extended drought and summer heat wave, even filling the much-depleted La Boca dam to the brim.\n\nBrett Anderson, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, said the extreme heat and drought Mexico experienced will become more normal due to climate change, citing temperatures above the historical average at 5.2\u00b0C (9.4\u00b0F) in the capital, which received barely over a third of the normal rainfall for this period.\n\nClimate change is also expected to contribute to more storms over the Atlantic this hurricane season, as warmer ocean waters allow powerful storms to intensify more rapidly.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Alberto would continue to bring heavy rains and flooding across parts of northeastern Mexico and that much of the Texas coastline could continue to see moderate flooding.\n\nThe storm made landfall earlier on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and is churning west across the country at 18 miles per hour, packing maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, the NHC said.\n\nForecasters had warned that Alberto, which brought rain and storm swells across the Gulf of Mexico, was also interacting with formations in the Pacific, together throwing more downpours on Central America, causing floods and landslides.\n\nAt least 22 deaths have been reported in Central America since the heavy rains last weekend. These include 13 in El Salvador, eight in Guatemala and one in Honduras, where authorities said over 900 were evacuated from their homes.\n\nGuatemalan authorities said on Thursday 370 people remained in temporary shelters and almost 300 houses had suffered severe damage.\n\n\"The climate crisis is making extreme weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms more frequent and severe,\" said

At least two were minors.\n\nOver the border in Texas, a disaster declaration is already in place.\n\nA bulletin from the NHC on Wednesday night warned of \"life-threatening\" flooding and mudslides in north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas.\n\nMaximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80km/h) have been reported. The system has been upgraded from a tropical cyclone, but remains below hurricane-strength.\n\nNHC meteorologists expect it to make landfall in Mexico later on Thursday before it dissipates without directly striking the US.\n\nThe Nuevo Le\u00f3n state governor has announced the temporary suspension of public transportation. In neighbouring Tamaulipas, schools have been closed.\n\nAlthough the storm is several hundreds miles off the US Gulf Coast, its edges have brought significant rainfall to Texas. Some 4in (10cm) have fallen in Southside, near Houston, prompting evacuations, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\n\nThe state's disaster declaration, issued by Governor Greg Abbott, means that \"widespread and severe property damage, injury and loss of life\" are possible.\n\nThe North Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to November. This year, there could be as many as seven major hurricanes, the US weather agency warned last month. That would be more than double the usual number.\n\nRecord-high sea surface temperatures are partly to blame, as is a likely shift in regional weather patterns.\n\nWhile there is no evidence climate change is producing more hurricanes, it is making the most powerful ones more likely, and bringing heavier rainfall.\n\nHuman-made climate change also made recent extreme heat in the US south-west, Mexico and Central America around 35 times more likely, scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said in a new report on Thursday.\n\nThe onset of Alberto comes as much of the continent is again baked by high heat. As of Thursday morning, 86 million Americans - one in four of the population - are living in warning areas. Alerts are also in place in seven of Canada's provinces.\n\nBoston was among the eastern American cities that sweltered during the Juneteenth holiday - breaking a 101-year-old record temperature for

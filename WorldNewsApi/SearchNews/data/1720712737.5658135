It was murals, beautiful murals,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey were stunning. \u201cThis was the only church that featured artwork by members of the Group of Seven. And I\u2019m sorry to say that\u2019s been lost, from what I can see.\u201d Toronto Fire Services spokesman Deepak Chagger confirmed the loss. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that anything was saved at this point,\u201d he said in a phone interview. As flames began to shoot through the roof, firefighters pulled out due to the risk it would collapse, he said. Crews extinguished the main body of the fire by mid-morning, officials said. They have not yet determined a cause. The St. Anne\u2019s website said the church in 1923 commissioned founding Group of Seven member J.E.H. MacDonald to oversee designs depicting the life of Christ on the building\u2019s interior. MacDonald then signed on nine other artists, including Franklin Carmichael and Frederick Varley. The three men formed part of the school of landscape painters known as the Group of Seven, renowned for their bright depictions of windswept forests and boreal ruggedness that helped forge a romanticized sense of Canadian vitality and independence. \u201cThis is an extraordinary loss,\u201d Beyers said a block from the building \u2014 also known as the Group of Seven church. \u201cNot only was the art important, but the church itself was important architecturally. It was one of the rare Anglican churches that was in the Byzantine style, an Eastern Christian style,\u201d he said. \u201cThis church provided a vital resource to the city of Toronto, particularly in this neighbourhood.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 9, 2024.", "summary": "A four-alarm fire ripped through St. Anne&#8217;s Anglican Church in Toronto on Sunday morning, severely damaging a national historic site and destroying the &#8220;priceless&#8221; Group of Seven murals inside.

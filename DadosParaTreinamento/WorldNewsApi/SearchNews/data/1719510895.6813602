This was the submission of former Minister of Defence, Prince Adetokunbo Kayode, SAN, while reacting to the readiness of the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led government to commence implementation of the DICON Act. He explained that the Act would activate the Defence industrial sector that would see to the manufacturing of military equipment, arms and ammunition domestically. According to the former Defence Minister, besides creating job opportunities in the industry in the federation, there would be tremendous reduction in capital flight in terms of funds used for procuring the equipment and munition. He also commended current Minister of Defence, Alhaji Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, for the operationalization of the new DICON Act and other achievements of Defence Ministry. Adetokunbo, who is the Chairman, Security and Logistics Worldwide Limited, stated that \u201cThe Defence Industry Corporation Of Nigeria, established in 1964 is primarily aimed at providing arms and ammunition and critical infrastructure support for the nation\u2019s armed forces and other security agencies. Its effectiveness was hampered by lack of political will and legacy challenges. \u201cThe new DICON law signed last year by President Tinubu established a domesticated national defence industries sector. The law seeks a transition into a national Military Industrial Complex (MIC) driven by the private sector, public-private partnerships, self-funding, but properly regulated by government. \u201cWith committed implementation, the initiative will ultimately save Nigeria huge costs in procurement of imported military hardware, create employment. Nigeria becomes a player in the defence industry sector while opening doors for export earnings. \u201cIt will definitely and positively contribute to supporting our defence and security services in dealing with the national security situations now and in the future. \u201cNigeria already has agreements with several countries on defence and security cooperation, the DICON law will enable us operationalize and maximize opportunities emanating from these understandings.\u201d Moreover, the former Minister also supported motion moved by House of Representatives member, Babajimi Benson, on the resuscitation of the Defence Industries Association of Nigeria (DIAN). He said it would complement the DICON because DIAN aims at domesticating the industry and help nation\u2019s private sector to participate in the sector. Prince Adetokunbo said: \u201cThe active participation of the private sector in this new economy is very critical to the success of the government initiative. \u201cIdentifying Private sector investment as the key engine for growth in any economy. NACCIMA, MAN and the entire Organised Private Sector (OPS) should move expeditiously in supporting the efforts of government and also to profit from the policies.\u201d", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"479\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0022-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0022-1.jpg 768w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0022-1-300x187.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></div>The activation of the new Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria Act (DICON) has been described as another giant socio-economic stride that would create job opportunities and reduce substantially capital flight in the country.

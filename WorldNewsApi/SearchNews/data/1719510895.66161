Images of the trading card have been posted to Twitter, formally known as X. In the post, Topps, a collectible card manufacturing company, says that they have \u201cproduced exactly 110 copies, and we\u2019re gifting them all to @lizzzzzzzzzzy.\u201d \u201cLiz, you\u2019re a champ!\u201d The card includes McGuire\u2019s name, and a blurb below that says \u201cfan wears 110MPH foul ball like a champ.\u201d McGuire initially posted an image of herself to social media after the game, including a large welt on her forehead and subsequent black eye. She tagged the Blue Jays in the tweet, and has since gone viral. \u201cHey @BlueJays I got my face mashed in by a 110mph foul off Bo Bichette's bat,\u201d she wrote in a post on X. \u201cI didn't even get the ball. I even stayed till the end of the game. Any way you can hook a girl up?\u201d In replies to her post on X, McGuire said she went to St. Michael\u2019s Hospital after the 4-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays to get checked out. Luckily, she said, she did not have a concussion or fracture. McGuire has since listed four of the baseball cards to Ebay, and has plans to donate some of the proceeds to Holland Bloorview pediatric hospital. The cards range in cost, with two over US$1,000. McGuire has listed the cards for sale as bids, offering to autograph the cards by request. They listings have already garnered over 1,800 views since being listed online within the last 24-hours. \u201cHi all! After 100s of you asking. I\u2019ve posted a limit number of cards to ebay. Partial proceedings will go to @HBKidsHospital \u2026 #topps #bluejays #mlb #tothecore #baseball #baseballcards,\u201d she posted. -With files from CTV's Phil Tsekouras", "summary": "Liz McGuire, the Blue Jays fan who was struck in the face with a 110 m.p.h. foul ball last week, has been pictured on a custom baseball trading card applauding her fandom to the game.", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/custom-baseball-card-released-of-blue-jays-fan-struck-in-the-face-with-foul-ball-1.6900884", "image": "https://www.cp24.com/content/dam/cp24/en/images/2024/5/25/liz-mcguire-1-6900848-1716661049470.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:39", "author": "Brooklyn Connolly", "authors": ["Brooklyn Connolly"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.302}

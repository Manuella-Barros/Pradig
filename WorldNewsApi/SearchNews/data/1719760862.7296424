The annual event, which culminates on Wednesday, features a variety of activities aimed at enhancing literacy and encouraging a love for reading among students. Ena McCollin is the school\u2019s Language Arts Coordinator. \u201cWe are not only emphasising reading but also fostering competency in various aspects of life,\u201d she explained. \u201cOur goal is to help students recognise and utilise their talents across different domains, whether it\u2019s through visual arts, performing arts like dancing and singing, or academics.\u201d Highlighting Hindsbury Primary\u2019s exceptional literacy level, McCollin noted that the school boasts a record of being placed with the top five schools in the common entrance exams for the last few years. She attributed this successful track record to \u201cthe sacrifice of the teachers who place a lot of interest in the classrooms and how they deliver the curriculum\u201d. The language coordinator told Barbados TODAY that the institution incorporates several reading programmes within the classroom coupled with activities in other areas to assist students in improving their literacy skills. \u201cI find that once you have children involved in different activities, whether it be dancing, singing or sports, it tends to open up their mind and their understanding to a lot of other areas,\u201d she said. The teacher also underscored the importance of parental involvement in ensuring that children are up to speed. \u201cHelp them with their homework, help them with reading a book. I find that a lot of parents now lean [more] towards the devices. Gone are the days where they sit and read with their children,\u201d said McCollin, urging parents to lessen screen time and incorporate more physical reading. One of the hallmarks of Literacy Week was Tuesday\u2019s Speak-Off competition, where some 14 Class Three and Four students showcased their oratorical skills on various topics. One student, Ziava Gordon, was eager to share her experience participating in the event, admitting that she was \u201cnervous at first\u201d. \u201cI just finished doing a speak-off for Literacy Week and I did well,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cMy mother said that I did very well and I was very nervous at first but now that it is over, I feel very pleased with what I have done.\u201d The Class Three student shared an encouraging message to other participants: \u201cJust know that it\u2019s not about winning, it\u2019s about having fun in what you do. If you don\u2019t come first, second, or third, it\u2019s okay because there are other events that you can join and you should be pleased with what you get.\u201d On her presentation entitled If I had One Superpower, What Would It Be, Gordon told Barbados TODAY that her choice would be the gift of healing. \u201cThe reason I chose the power to be able to heal people is because my grandfather died in 2019, and I never got the chance to meet him. He died due to cancer, and there was a girl from my school, her name is Jasmine Clark. She passed away because she got hit, but if I had the power back then, I would have saved them, and today, they would be here to watch me perform and have fun.\u201d In addition to academic activities, Hindsbury Primary incorporated creative elements into Literacy Week, with each age group tasked with decorating boards or murals based on designated themes. The murals were then showcased on the school\u2019s walls, fostering a sense of pride among students.", "summary": "<p>The Hindsbury Primary School is abuzz with excitement as it celebrates its annual Literacy Week, themed Cultivating Excellent Readers &#8211; Sowing Seeds of Literacy.\u00a0 The annual event, which culminates on&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://barbadostoday.bb/2024/05/29/hindsbury-primary-seeds-love-of-reading/\">Hindsbury Primary seeds love of reading</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://barbadostoday.bb\">Barbados Today</a>.</p>", "url": "https://barbadostoday.bb/2024/05/29/hindsbury-primary-seeds-love-of-reading/", "image": "https://barbadostoday.bb/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0905-scaled-e1716958794191.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:15:12", "author": "Shanna Moore", "authors": ["Shanna Moore"], "language": "en", "source_country": "bb", "sentiment": 0.474}

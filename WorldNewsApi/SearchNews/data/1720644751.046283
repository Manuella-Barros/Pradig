Former Leeds Rhinos and England star Burrow died at the age 41 last Sunday after a four-and-a-half year battle with motor neurone disease. He dedicated the last few years of his life to raising awareness of the disease and helped raise millions for charity. The Prince of Wales was among those to pay tribute to Burrow upon his passing while many laid flowers outside of the Rhinos\u2019 home ground Headingley and again at Wembley on Saturday in front of the Rugby League Legends statue. Burrow\u2019s life was celebrated in a number of ways ahead of the final between Warrington Wolves and Wigan Warriors, with Warrington boss Sam Burgess telling BBC Sport: \u2018If you could pin down a week in the calendar \u2013 it\u2019s fitting that it\u2019s on the big stage at Wembley. \u2018All [his] achievements, not just on the field but off the field, hopefully we can celebrate them in style with a smile on the face and remember him for what a special character he was. \u2018Hopefully everyone puts on a great performance. There\u2019s three great matches and [hopefully] we all do him justice.\u2019 Flowers and messages were left outside the Rugby League Legends statue at Wembley (Photo: Getty) Kick-off for the final was delayed by seven minutes to 3:07pm to reflect the shirt number Burrow wore throughout his decorated career.

MNUFC captain Michael Boxall \u2014 who has played all 1,440 minutes across 16 games this season \u2014 will not be joining New Zealand for the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) Nations Cup next week, he told the Pioneer Press on Saturday. \u201cHad a few conversations \u2014 happy to stick around,\u201d Boxall said inside the Loons dressing room post-match. The Kiwis are scheduled to play group-stage matches June 18 and June 21. If they advanced all the way to the final and Boxall was with them, he could have missed approximately four MLS matches while playing for his country through June 30. \u201cIt will give some younger players from New Zealand the opportunity to get some minutes and some experience,\u201d Boxall, 35, said. \u201cI\u2019ll be around. And my wife (Libby) will be happy I\u2019m not gone for three weeks.\u201d On top of his day job, Boxall will remain on daddy duty for his two young children. The Loons will get back the majority of their internationals before Saturday\u2019s game at the Seattle Sounders. Goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair (Canada) and midfielder Alejandro Bran (Costa Rica) are expected to remain with their national teams for Copa America. It\u2019s uncertain if striker Tani Oluwaseyi will remain with Canada for that regional tournament; he was a late call-up to Canada\u2019s two friendlies this week. Not kept in a Kage Loons academy prospect and current MNUFC2 player Kage Romanshyn has been training regularly with the first team since preseason started in January. So, the 18-year-old Apple Valley native\u2019s MLS debut Saturday wasn\u2019t exactly a push into the deep end of the pool. \u201cTraining with these guys every day, it makes me so much better, working on my game against them,\u201d Romanshyn said of work done during the week in Blaine. \u201cI just feel like I\u2019m getting better every day.\u201d Romanshyn said there were \u201ca little bit\u201d of nerves before subbing into the match for a 12-minute shift in the second half. \u201cBut kind of when I just stepped on the pitch, I just kind of felt at home,\u201d Romanshyn said. \u201cI felt ready. It was good. \u201cHonestly, it was a surreal experience,\u201d Romanshyn continued. \u201cI had so much fun. It kind of felt like a bit of hard work paid off, which was really fun. (I\u2019m) just thankful for the coaches for believing in me.\u201d Romanshyn is subjected to some friendly ribbing from veterans on the team. Six-year midfielder Hassani Dotson says he tries to strike a balance with newcomers. \u201cI like to joke around with guys,\u201d Dotson said. \u201cNothing too heavy, but talk to them a lot and make sure they know they can come to me with anything. I welcome the competition. I want him to be loud and aggressive, and let him know it\u2019s his career too. He doesn\u2019t have to take a back seat because he\u2019s with older guys. That is one thing I really like about him is that he\u2019s got that fire. He\u2019ll let you know if you mess up. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d Jokes include referring to Romanshyn by his actual first name, Keith. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know if that is his legal name, but that came up,\u201d Dotson said. \u201cSo we play around with little Keith.\u201d MLS debutants wear a small patch commemorating their achievement on the chest of their jerseys this season. \u201cProbably frame it,\u201d Romanshyn said, still wearing the black shirt in front of his locker. \u201cPut it up in my house.\u201d Irwin keeps Loons level With St. Clair expected to be away for weeks, the Loons need backup goalkeeper Clint Irwin to step up. He did so Saturday with three big saves in the second half in St. Paul. \u201cExactly what we needed from him,\u201d head coach Eric Ramsay said. \u201cHe has been a really big part of what we are doing. He is very good behind the scenes, perfect character for that No. 2 goalkeeper, really good influence in the dressing room, really steady guy, very positive, and we needed him to perform. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that he has done so because it sets off really well this period that he is going to be standing in for Dayne,\u201d Ramsay continued. \u201cI did not have any doubts about him, I don\u2019t think any of the staff had any doubts about him, and he has proved that.\u201d The Loons don\u2019t have a third goalkeeper on their MLS roster. They have called up MNUFC2\u2019s Alec Smir three times on short-term loans, including Saturday\u2019s game, and since he hasn\u2019t played, he has only one more loan available this season. That means the club might sign Smir to an MLS contract for the rest of the season to provide cover at the position.", "summary": "MNUFC debutant Kage Romanshyn said he 'felt at home' in first MLS game.", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2024/06/09/loons-captain-michael-boxall-will-stick-with-club-this-month-wont-join-new-zealand-team/", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/STP-L-jea-16-UNITED_FILERS-0302-1.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:32:17", "author": "Andy Greder", "authors": ["Andy Greder"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.007}

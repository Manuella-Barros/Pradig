But \"Momala\" will always be the one that means the most.'\n\nWhile she has now been married to Doug for almost 10 years, she originally waited to be introduced to his children until about two months after their first date.\n\nIn an essay for Elle on motherhood, she explained 'As a child of divorce, I knew how hard it can be when your parents start to date other people.\n\n'We agreed to commit to each other for six months, and to re-evaluate our relationship at the end of it,' Kamala shared recounting their rather business-like agreement.\n\nHowever, things went from strength to strength in her relationship with Doug and she did meet his two children, Ella and Cole, from his first marriage to Kerstin Emhoff.\n\nKamala wrote in her Elle essay that she was 'already hooked on Doug' she stated that it was those two kids that 'reeled her in', saying: 'Cole and Ella could not have been more welcoming. They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in.'\n\nCole and Ella are grown adults now, with Cole, 29, working in the entertainment industry like his film producer mother, while his sister Ella, 25, is a fashion designer and model.\n\nWe're sure they're very proud of their Momala as she runs for president!", "source": {"uri": "evoke.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "EVOKE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clare_mccarthy@evoke.ie", "name": "Clare McCarthy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerstin_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerstin Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Children", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Children", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://evoke.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kamala-Harris-Stepchildren-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754603", "eventUri": "eng-9754603", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-", "textStart": 681, "textEnd": 692}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Doug was previously married for 16 years to Kerstin Emhoff, with whom he welcomed his son Cole in 1994 and daughter Ella in 1999.\n\nTwo months after she began to date Doug, he introduced her to his children, who were teenagers at the time. She has since developed a close bond with them, telling PEOPLE in October 2023 that they affectionately call her \"Momala.\" \"It's the name the kids gave me, and I wear it proudly,\" she said.\n\n\"They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults,\" she wrote in a personal essay for ELLE in 2019. \"I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in.\"\n\nHere's everything to know about Kamala Harris' stepchildren, Ella and Cole.\n\nDoug and his ex-wife Kerstin welcomed Cole on Sept. 15, 1994, naming him after jazz musician John Coltrane. Cole was raised in California and was nearly 20 years old when his father married Harris.\n\nHe shared in a conversation with his father and sister for Glamour in 2020 that he liked Harris from the moment he met her during a dinner at The Reel Inn, and got to know her as a stepmother first rather than a politician.\n\nCole added, however, that her political side came out at the dinner table when they would engage in serious conversations.\n\n\"We would just have these real conversations at dinner, almost Socratic, where we would all bounce off each other,\" he said. \"It's so interesting when I hear her speak publicly or read about her policy position. I'm like, Okay, I've seen that reflected at the dinner table, so I know it's true to her.\"\n\nCole attended Colorado College, from which he graduated in 2017 with a degree in psychology, per his LinkedIn. Now, he works for Plan B Entertainment, a production company co-founded by Brad Pitt behind films like Minari and The Departed.\n\nIn his personal life, Cole married his longtime girlfriend, Greenley Littlejohn, on Oct. 14, 2023. Harris officiated the ceremony, telling PEOPLE a month later that the moment \"meant so much for so many reasons.\"\n\n\"It was so wonderful that the kids asked me to do it,\" she said. \"For us, we think of marriage as being not just between these two people, but the coming together of families. So it was very much with that spirit that we all participated.\"\n\nShe added that in addition to giving advice to the couple -- such as checking in with one another frequently -- Harris hoped they knew they were supported.\n\n\"I want for those two [Cole and Greenley] to have a loving marriage where they are best friends and they know that it's not just them against the world, that our family supports them,\" she said. \"That the community of people that came together at the wedding supports [them].\"\n\nElla Emhoff was born on May 29, 1999, to Doug and Kerstin and was named after another jazz musician, Ella Fitzgerald. Ella was starting high school when her dad introduced her to Harris and was in college at The New School's Parsons School of Design when her stepmother was elected to be vice president.\n\nBefore she assumed her role, Ella helped Harris on the campaign trail, making occasional appearances and supporting her when she was sworn in in January 2021.\n\n\"I think it was also that intense wave of realization and anxiety that, 'Wow, I'm not looking at this from the outside. I'm looking at it from the inside. This is all happening to me too,' \" she shared in Glamour of what it felt like to join President Joe Biden's campaign in 2020 in support of Harris. \"I felt extreme love and excitement, but also a little bit of shock.\"\n\nIn May 2021, Ella graduated from college, with Harris marking the special occasion on Instagram.\n\n\"Congratulations to our daughter Ella on her graduation,\" she wrote in the caption. \"I am so proud of you. Keep dreaming with ambition and there is nothing you cannot achieve.\"\n\nSince then, Ella has pivoted into a career as a model and fashion designer. She was signed by IMG Models Worldwide in January 2021 and has modeled for brands such as Balenciaga. Ella even made her Met Gala red carpet debut in May 2021 wearing Adidas by Stella McCartney.\n\nIn January 2022, Ella announced she would be continuing to create knitwear -- which she often posts about on Instagram -- under her name. She also hosts a Soft Hands Knitting Club in New York City where she teaches others how to knit.\n\nLater that year, Ella was named as one of Harper's Bazaar's icons of the year for her impact on fashion.\n\n\"It's kind of shocking,\" she told PEOPLE of the acknowledgment in September 2022. \"This is an incredible honor and as someone who doesn't really think of herself like that it's nice reassurance. And makes me check myself and the way I perceive myself, so exciting.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In honor of Mother's Day, Vice President Harris writes about what it's like to be a stepmom -- or, as her kids call her \"Momala.\"\n\nWhen I met Doug, the man who would become my husband, I also met a man who was a divorced father of two children, Cole and Ella, named after John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald. As a child of divorce, I knew how hard it could be when your parents start to date other people. And I was determined not to insert myself in their lives until Doug and I had established we were in this for the long haul. Children need consistency; I didn't want to insert myself into their lives as a temporary fixture because I didn't want to disappoint them. There's nothing worse than disappointing a child.\n\nSo, we took it slow, and Doug and I put a lot of thought into when and how I would first meet the kids. And that meant waiting. As we waited, anticipation grew. When the day finally came, I had butterflies in my stomach. The plan was to go to a seafood hut off the Pacific Coast Highway called the Reel Inn, a favorite of the kids.\n\nOn my way to meet Doug, I picked up a tin of cookies and tied a ribbon in a bow around them. I took a few deep breaths. I was excited, and I was nervous. I rehearsed what I would say. Would the kids think the cookies were really nice or really weird? Was the ribbon too much? (The ribbon was probably a little extra, but over the years Cole and Ella have spared me by not telling me that.)\n\nCole and Ella could not have been more welcoming. They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in.\n\nTo know Cole and Ella is to know that their mother Kerstin is an incredible mother. Kerstin and I hit it off ourselves and are dear friends. She and I became a duo of cheerleaders in the bleachers at Ella's swim meets and basketball games, often to Ella's embarrassment. We sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional.\n\nA few years later when Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term \"stepmom.\" Instead they came up with the name \"Momala.\"\n\nOur time as a family is Sunday dinner. We come together, all of us around the table, and over time we've fallen into our roles. Cole sets the table and picks the music, Ella makes beautiful desserts, Doug acts as my sous-chef, and I cook.\n\nFlash forward two years -- and it truly felt like a flash -- I was being sworn into the United States Senate. Cole had already graduated and was off at college, but Ella was just entering her senior year of high school in Los Angeles. This new job meant that I would be splitting time between California and Washington, D.C., and the hardest part was going to be being away from my Ella. I knew I was inevitably going to miss more than a few swim meets.\n\nAnd as you might guess, it ended up being more than swim meets.\n\nOn June 8, 2017, FBI Director James Comey was asked to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his firing and the Russia investigation. It was the same day as Ella's high school graduation, a scheduling conflict that I was acutely aware of, but that the Senate Intelligence Committee -- and for that matter the rest of the country -- was not.\n\nI agonized over the scheduling conflict and ultimately took a deep breath and called Ella from D.C. She could not have been more understanding when I told her I wouldn't be able to make it back in time, but I still felt awful about it.\n\nI sought the advice of my female colleagues in the Senate. And it was Maggie Hassan, the senator from New Hampshire, who offered me some sage wisdom. \"Our kids love us for who we are and the sacrifices we make,\" she said. \"They get it.\"\n\nI believe you don't have to be a U.S. Senator or a candidate for President of the United States for that to ring true. Time is precious, and so many of us understand the struggle to seek balance.\n\nI ended up missing the graduation ceremony during the day but made it home in time for our time: Family dinner that night.\n\nAnd Maggie was right. Fortunately for me, both Ella and Cole do get it. They are my endless source of love and pure joy. I am so thankful to Doug, to Kerstin, and most of all, to Ella and Cole. And as our family embarks together on this new journey -- one that has taken me to South Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Nevada, and Michigan in the last few weeks alone -- I can say one thing with certainty, my heart wouldn't be whole, nor my life full, without them.", "source": {"uri": "elle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now that President Joe Biden officially dropped out of the 2024 Presidential race and publicly endorsed Vice President Harris, all eyes are on the Harris-Emhoff family again.\n\nPer Harris' memoir The Truth We Hold, Harris and her husband met back in 2013 on a blind date and she met his teenage kids two months later. Harris and Emhoff married a year later in 2014, and she became the loving stepmom to Cole and Ella.\n\nWhile Ella Emhoff has a higher profile than her older brother due to her modeling career, Cole is living a little bit more of a low-key life.\n\nHarris' stepson, Cole Emhoff, is a film assistant and producer and the firstborn son of Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, and his ex-wife, Kerstin.\n\nCole Mackin Emhoff was born on Sept. 15, 1994, to Doug Emhoff and Kerstin Emhoff (n\u00e9e Mackin), who is the co-founder and CEO of the production company Prettybird. Cole was born and raised in California.\n\nAccording to a 2019 essay Harris wrote for Elle, Doug and Kerstin actually named Cole Emhoff after jazz musician John Coltrane while Ella was named after Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nHe graduated from Colorado College in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. Per the college's website, he did a 2017 presentation entitled \"Fake News: How Cognitive Biases Interact with Social Networking Sites to Influence People's Perception of Misinformation.\"\n\nHe began his career as an assistant at William Morris Endeavor, a major entertainment agency, per YourTango. Since his first job, he has gravitated even more into the entertainment world like his mother.\n\nHe is now a film assistant, actor, and producer. Cole works for Plan B Entertainment, a production company co-founded by Brad Pitt. Per his IMDb profile, he has worked as an assistant on projects such as Minari and the 2022 version of Father of the Bride. Along with that, he produced a short called Peacocking, and acted in the 2017 short called Dance Lady Dance.\n\nSince 2023, Cole has been married to to Greenley Littlejohn, who is the Global Product Development Manager for Brand ID, per her LinkedIn. Not much is known about their romance, but we do know that they started dating around 2018 to 2019. Cole revealed in a February 2019 post that he and Littlejohn had moved in together and got some words of praise from his dad who commented, \"So proud of you, Cole.\"\n\nIn a May 2 Instagram post, Littlejohn revealed that Cole proposed to her in front of family and friends. The pair married on Oct 5, 2023, at the Vibiana in Los Angeles, California, in a ceremony officiated by Harris.\n\n\"It meant so much for so many reasons,\" she told People at the time. \"It was so wonderful that the kids asked me to do it. For us, we think of marriage as being not just between these two people, but the coming together of families. So it was very much with that spirit that we all participated.\"\n\nIn a 2020 interview with Glamour, Cole said that he bonded instantly with Harris. \"We would just have these real conversations at dinner, almost Socratic, where we would all bounce off each other,\" he revealed. \"It's so interesting when I hear her speak publicly or read about her policy position. I'm like, Okay, I've seen that reflected at the dinner table, so I know it's true to her.\"\n\nIn July, Harris revealed that Cole and Ella affectionately refer to her as \"Momala,\" which she considers her favorite title. \"It's the name the kids gave me, and I wear it proudly,\" she told People.\n\nAs we've seen on his Instagram, he clearly loves their family dog Otis; and he adores the two cats he and his wife share: cats named Sugar and Butter.\n\nWhile they haven't talked much about it, it's clear Cole and Ella Emhoff are quite close. They're on each other's social quite a bit, always go to important events for one another, and more.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Shyamala and Donald divorced when Kamala was seven.\n\nShe graduated from Howard University and the University of California, Hastings College of Law and began her career in the office of the district attorney of Alameda County. From there, she moved to San Fransico to take up the same position, before working for the city attorney's office.\n\nHarris was previously a US senator from 2017 to 2021 and the attorney general of California from 2011 to 2017. She was selected by Biden to be his running mate in the 2020 election, after she withdrew from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nAfter Biden's announcement on Sunday, she launched her own campaign for president with his endorsement.\n\nHarris met lawyer Doug Emhoff in 2013 after a mutual friend set them up on a blind date.\n\nBorn exactly one week before Harris on October 13, Emhoff is the son of Jewish parents Barbara and Michael Emhoff. He grew up in New Jersey but the family moved to California when he was 17.\n\nEmhoff attended California State University, Northridge and University of Southern California before becoming an entertainment lawyer. In 2000, he opened up his own firm and joined DLA Piper as a partner in 2017. He left the firm after Biden and Harris were elected to avoid conflict of interest concerns.\n\nHe was married for 16 years to Kerstin Emhoff, an American film producer. They had two children together, Cole and Ella.\n\nHarris and Emhoff tied the knot in 2014, with Maya Harris officiating the ceremony.\n\nAs mentioned, Harris is the stepmother to Emhoff's two children and, as a result, they are officially part of the second family of the United States and - if she is successful in her presidential campaign - will become the first family.\n\nCole was born in 1994 and, according to Harris's Elle essay, he was named after American jazz saxophonist John Coltrane.\n\nIn the piece, Harris mentioned how the family spend time together around the table for Sunday dinners. Cole's role in this is to set the table and pick the music.\n\nAccording to his IMDB page, he followed his mother's footsteps into the entertainment industry, having worked as an assistant for the 2022 Father of the Bride remake and for 2020's Minari. Cole is also credited as an actor in Dance Lady Dance, a short film from 2017.\n\nIn October 2023, Harris was the officiant at Cole's wedding to longterm girlfriend Greenley Littlejohn.\n\nIn a statement to People at the time, Harris said that being asked to officiate \"meant so much for so many reasons.\"\n\n\"For us, we think of marriage as being not just between these two people, but the coming together of families. So it was very much with that spirit that we all participated,\" she said.\n\n\"I love my husband. I love our marriage. I want for those two [Cole and Greenley] to have a loving marriage where they are best friends and they know that it's not just them against the world, that our family supports them. That the community of people that came together at the wedding supports (them).\"\n\nElla is a 25-year-old model, artist and fashion designer. Like Cole, her name comes from a legendary jazz performer, Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nShe graduated from Parsons School of Design in New York City in 2021 and now designs and sells jackets, hats, coats and knitted shorts. She also sells ceramics, paintings and drawings.\n\nOn Inauguration Day 2021, Ella garnered attention for a Miu Miu coat she wore and was signed with IMG Models worldwide, a New York-based agency, just a week later. She is also a member of the 3% Movement, which is focused on increasing the number of women creative directors in the US.\n\nIn Harris's Elle piece, she wrote that her stepdaughter was on her school's swim and basketball teams and enjoyed making dessert for the family's Sunday dinners.\n\nAccording to her essay, when Harris was sworn into the United States Senate, Ella entered her senior year of high school in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\"This new job meant that I would be splitting time between California and Washington, D.C., and the hardest part was going to be being away from my Ella,\" she wrote at the time.\n\nHerself and brother Cole have coined the nickname \"Momala\" for Harris.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors":

Don't overthink it,\" Harris wrote about her friend saying. \"Just meet him. I already gave him your number. He's going to reach out.\" (In a 2021 interview with CBS News, Harris revealed that she did Google Emhoff before their date.)\n\nA few days later, Emhoff texted Harris while at a basketball game. They briefly exchanged messages before planning to talk on the phone the next day. The next morning, Emhoff left Harris a voicemail that was \"long and a little rambling.\"\n\n\"The voicemail, which I still have saved to this day, was long and a little rambling. He sounded like a nice guy, though, and I was intrigued to learn more,\" Harris wrote.\n\n\"There was no pretense or posing with Doug, no arrogance or boasting,\" Harris wrote about their first meeting. \"He seemed so genuinely comfortable with himself. It's part of why I liked him immediately.\"\n\n2013: When Kamala met Doug's children, Cole and Ella\n\nEmhoff was previously married to Kerstin Emhoff, and they had two children, Cole and Ella, named after John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nIn a May 2019 piece for Elle, Harris shared her intention to take things slow when meeting Emhoff's children.\n\n\"As a child of divorce, I knew how hard it could be when your parents start to date other people,\" she wrote. \"And I was determined not to insert myself in their lives until Doug and I had established we were in this for the long haul.\"\n\nHarris said they waited \"about two months\" after their first date for her to meet the children, but the kids \"could not have been more welcoming.\"\n\n\"They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults,\" she wrote. \"I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in.\"\n\n2014: When Doug proposed to Kamala\n\nHarris recounted that Emhoff proposed to her while she was stressed about finding a pair of missing pants before a trip to Italy. After agreeing to order takeout, Emhoff popped the question, and Harris initially didn't realise it.\n\n\"I want to spend my life with you,\" Emhoff told her.\n\n\"I didn't register the significance of what he'd said at all. I didn't even look up. My mind was still on the black pants,\" she wrote.\n\n\"'No, I want to spend my life with you,' he said again,\" Harris recounted. \"When I looked up, he was getting down on one knee. He'd planned to propose in front of the Ponte Vecchio, but once he had the ring, he couldn't keep it secret.\"\n\nHarris wrote that she burst into tears and said yes.\n\n2014: When Kamala and Doug married\n\nHarris and Emhoff married on August 22, 2014, in a small ceremony officiated by Harris' younger sister, Maya. The Emhoff children and Harris agreed not to use the term \"stepmom,\" opting for \"Momala\" instead.\n\nHarris and Emhoff spent more time in Washington, D.C., after Harris was elected as one of California's senators.

Though she was raised in California, she is now a graduate of the elite Parsons School of Design and affectionately known as \"The First Daughter of Bushwick,\" in a nod to the hipster-filled Brooklyn neighborhood she reportedly calls home.\n\nThe Gen-Z creative first burst into the public eye when she appeared at President Joe Biden's inauguration in January 2021 dripped out in a sharply tailored and ornately bedazzled Miu Miu coat, alongside her older brother Cole, who works for a Los Angeles production company.\n\nThe youngest Emhoff was also spotted rocking a look by the high-end preppy fashion brand Thom Browne the night before Biden's inauguration. Michelle Obama had commissioned the same New York City designer for a dress to wear to her husband Barack's second inauguration in 2013.\n\nElla signed to the fashion powerhouse IMG Models shortly after the inauguration; the agency also boasts supermodels including Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, and Gisele B\u00fcndchen as clientele. She's since graced the runway for fashion labels such as Balenciaga, Miu Miu, and Proenza Schouler (as well as landing on the front row at shows she's not walking in).\n\nElla made her Met Gala debut in May 2021, alongside Inventing Anna star Julia Garner, in baggy trousers and a bejeweled ruby red mesh cutout top that masked the tattoo sleeves circling her arms.\n\n(\"With hair and tattoos and things like that, I think they're all in the realm of like, 'I don't understand it, but I want you to be who you want to be,'\" Ella said of her parents in a 2021 interview with The New York Times.)\n\nAnd she was included in the 2022 list of \"Bazaar Icons\" curated by the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar.\n\n\"These days, I think it's harder to feel iconic,\" she told the fashion magazine -- angst and ennui are, after all, hallmarks of the 20something existence. \"But I felt really iconic when I was a kid. I really had a lot of confidence, and I would do things that just felt like I'm the boss bitch of this world. I think whenever I try to feel iconic, I think back to little Ella and what would she do?\"\n\nToday, Ella she runs her own knitwear brand and crew, the Soft Hands Knitting Club. The often sold-out club meetings teach NYC residents how to create their own designs, and are frequently held at sustainable pop-up shops and women-owned businesses.\n\nIn June 2024, she signed with the Hollywood talent agency UTA, with The Hollywood Reporter noting her hopes to \"do more knitwear collaborations with fashion brands.\"\n\n\"Knitting and textile art in general has and always will be a therapeutic practice for me. I treat it as something to calm my anxiety,\" she explained in a 2023 interview. \"I feel very lucky that I'm able to mix what keeps me feeling centered and grounded as a human with my career.\"\n\nElla was in high school when she was first introduced to Kamala. She's said her parents and her stepmom have a healthy dynamic and operate like \"a three-person parenting squad.\" Ella and Cole have been affectionately calling the vice president \"Momala\" long before Drew Barrymore hard-launched the nickname during an effusive interview on her show this past April that soon went viral.\n\nElla has had a few of her own forays into politics, having stumped for her stepmom in previous campaigns. She also (briefly) sought to raise money for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in March, after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and ensuing war in Gaza sparked a humanitarian aid crisis.\n\nShe posted a sign of support for Harris' presidential candidacy on Monday, amplifying another viral trend: The \"brat\" meme popularized by British pop singer Charli XCX.

Notably, conservatives have long criticized her for not having any biological children.\n\nOne social media post shared a picture of Harris' stepdaughter and stated she \"has NO NATURAL CHILDREN because children cannot be conceived via the esophagus.\"\n\nThe wave of misogynistic attacks is not new. Comments made by Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance in 2021, in which he implied Harris was a \"childless cat lady\" who had no stake in the future of the country because she had no children, resurfaced in 2024.\n\nWhile Harris does not have biological children, she is a stepmother of two through her marriage to Doug Emhoff in 2014. Emhoff had two children from his first marriage, Cole and Ella, who were still teenagers when he began dating Harris. While they are not her biological children, Harris played a role in their upbringing, and according to most reports has a close relationship with them.\n\nThe actual nature of their relationship and whether they identify as her children, is a private family matter. However, given that they are not her biological children, we rate this claim as \"True.\"\n\nThe Emhoffs have affectionately referred to Harris with the nickname \"Momala.\" Harris has repeatedly described her close relationship with her husband's children, saying to supporters on Aug. 12, 2020, ahead of the 2020 presidential election: \"I've had a lot of titles over my career and certainly vice president will be great, but 'Momala' will always be the one that means the most.\"\n\nShe also referred to Cole and Ella as her kids: \"Family is everything to me too and I cannot wait for America to get to know my husband Doug and our amazing kids, Cole and Ella.\"\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Cole Emhoff described having to explain to Harris when he arrived home late one night:\n\nI was a senior when they got together, and I remember I saw a tweet that someone did. It was a photo of Kamala at the Kavanaugh hearing, and someone tweeted, like, \"I'd hate to have to look at that face and explain why I'm late for curfew.\" And I was thinking, \"I've literally had to do that.\"\n\nWhile it is true that Harris does not have biological children, she is reportedly close to her stepchildren and has a parental relationship with them.", "source": {"uri": "snopes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Snopes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_lady", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat lady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2024/07/kamala_and_doug.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754603", "eventUri": "eng-9754603", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-12", "textStart": 1461, "textEnd": 1474}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Though she was raised in California, she is now a graduate of the elite Parsons School of Design and affectionately known as \"The First Daughter of Bushwick,\" in a nod to the hipster-filled Brooklyn neighborhood she reportedly calls home.\n\nThe Gen-Z creative first burst into the public eye when she appeared at President Joe Biden's inauguration in January 2021 dripped out in a sharply tailored and ornately bedazzled Miu Miu coat, alongside her older brother Cole, who works for a Los Angeles production company.\n\nThe youngest Emhoff was also spotted rocking a look by the high-end preppy fashion brand Thom Browne the night before Biden's inauguration. Michelle Obama had commissioned the same New York City designer for a dress to wear to her husband Barack's second inauguration in 2013.\n\nElla signed to the fashion powerhouse IMG Models shortly after the inauguration; the agency also boasts supermodels including Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, and Gisele B\u00fcndchen as clientele. She's since graced the runway for fashion labels such as Balenciaga, Miu Miu, and Proenza Schouler (as well as landing on the front row at shows she's not walking in).\n\nElla made her Met Gala debut in May 2021, alongside Inventing Anna star Julia Garner, in baggy trousers and a bejeweled ruby red mesh cutout top that masked the tattoo sleeves circling her arms.\n\n(\"With hair and tattoos and things like that, I think they're all in the realm of like, 'I don't understand it, but I want you to be who you want to be,'\" Ella said of her parents in a 2021 interview with The New York Times.)\n\nAnd she was included in the 2022 list of \"Bazaar Icons\" curated by the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar.\n\n\"These days, I think it's harder to feel iconic,\" she told the fashion magazine -- angst and ennui are, after all, hallmarks of the 20something existence. \"But I felt really iconic when I was a kid. I really had a lot of confidence, and I would do things that just felt like I'm the boss bitch of this world. I think whenever I try to feel iconic, I think back to little Ella and what would she do?\"\n\nToday, Ella she runs her own knitwear brand and crew, the Soft Hands Knitting Club. The often sold-out club meetings teach NYC residents how to create their own designs, and are frequently held at sustainable pop-up shops and women-owned businesses.\n\nIn June 2024, she signed with the Hollywood talent agency UTA, with The Hollywood Reporter noting her hopes to \"do more knitwear collaborations with fashion brands.\"\n\n\"Knitting and textile art in general has and always will be a therapeutic practice for me. I treat it as something to calm my anxiety,\" she explained in a 2023 interview. \"I feel very lucky that I'm able to mix what keeps me feeling centered and grounded as a human with my career.\"\n\nElla was in high school when she was first introduced to Kamala. She's said her parents and her stepmom have a healthy dynamic and operate like \"a three-person parenting squad.\" Ella and Cole have been affectionately calling the vice president \"Momala\" long before Drew Barrymore hard-launched the nickname during an effusive interview on her show this past April that soon went viral.\n\nElla has had a few of her own forays into politics, having stumped for her stepmom in previous campaigns. She also (briefly) sought to raise money for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in March, after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and ensuing war in Gaza sparked a humanitarian aid crisis.\n\nShe posted a sign of support for Harris' presidential candidacy on Monday, amplifying another viral trend: The \"brat\" meme popularized by British pop singer Charli XCX.

And the kooky, all-too-cool creativity of her stepdaughter, 25-year-old Ella Emhoff, helps prove that, well, the coconut didn't fall too far from the tree.\n\nElla -- the daughter of Harris' husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and his former wife, film producer Kerstin Emhoff -- is a hustling multihyphenate, like so many of her generation: Fashion designer, model, \"multidisciplinary artist\" and yarn enthusiast. Though she was raised in California, she is now a a graduate of the elite Parsons School of Design and affectionately known as \"The First Daughter of Bushwick,\" in a nod to the hipster-filled Brooklyn neighborhood she reportedly calls home.\n\nThe Gen-Z creative first burst into the public eye when she appeared at President Joe Biden's inauguration in January 2021 dripped out in a sharply tailored and ornately bedazzled Miu Miu coat, alongside her older brother Cole, who works for a Los Angeles production company.\n\nThe youngest Emhoff was also spotted rocking a look by the high-end preppy fashion brand Thom Browne the night before Biden's inauguration. Michelle Obama had commissioned the same New York City designer for a dress to wear to her husband Barack's second inauguration in 2013\n\nElla signed to the fashion powerhouse IMG Models shortly after the inauguration; the agency also boasts supermodels including Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, and Gisele B\u00fcndchen as clientele. She's since graced the runway for fashion labels such as Balenciaga, Miu Miu and Proenza Schouler (as well as landing on the front row at shows she's not walking in).\n\nElla made her Met Gala debut in May 2021, alongside Inventing Anna star Julia Garner, in baggy trousers and a bejeweled ruby red mesh cutout top that masked the tattoo sleeves circling her arms.\n\n(\"With hair and tattoos and things like that, I think they're all in the realm of like, 'I don't understand it, but I want you to be who you want to be,'\" Ella said of her parents in a 2021 interview with The New York Times.)\n\nAnd she was included in the 2022 list of \"Bazaar Icons\" curated by the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar.\n\n\"These days, I think it's harder to feel iconic,\" she told the fashion magazine -- angst and ennui are, after all, hallmarks of the 20something existence. \"But I felt really iconic when I was a kid. I really had a lot of confidence, and I would do things that just felt like I'm the boss bitch of this world. I think whenever I try to feel iconic, I think back to little Ella and what would she do?\"\n\nToday, Ella she runs her own knitwear brand and crew, the Soft Hands Knitting Club. The often sold out club meetings teach NYC residents how to create their own designs, and are frequently held at sustainable pop-up shops and women-owned businesses.\n\nIn June 2024, she signed with the Hollywood talent agency UTA, with The Hollywood Reporter noting her hopes to \"do more knitwear collaborations with fashion brands.\"\n\n\"Knitting and textile art in general has and always will be a therapeutic practice for me. I treat it as something to calm my anxiety,\" she explained in a 2023 interview. \"I feel very lucky that I'm able to mix what keeps me feeling centered and grounded as a human with my career.\"\n\nElla was in high school when she was first introduced to Kamala. She's said her parents and her step mom have a healthy dynamic, and operate like \"a three-person parenting squad.\" Ella and Cole have been affectionately calling the vice president \"Momala\" long before Drew Barrymore hard-launched the nickname during an effusive interview on her show this past April that soon went viral.\n\nElla has had a few of her own forays into politics, having stumped for her stepmom in previous campaigns. She also (briefly) sought to raise money for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in March, after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and ensuing war in Gaza sparked a humanitarian aid crisis.\n\nShe posted a sign of support for Harris' presidential candidacy on Monday, amplifying another viral trend: The \"brat\" meme popularized by British pop singer Charli XCX. (\"Brat\" is also the title of the musician's recently-released album.) Shortly after President Biden endorsed Kamala as the Democratic nominee over the weekend, Charli tweeted that \"kamala IS brat,\" a term that means the vice president isn't afraid to buck conventional trends. Ella doubled down on Charli's characterization of her step-mom, sharing the post in an Instagram story on Monday with the caption: \"@charli_xcx gets it.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com",

In 2013, a friend of hers and a client of Doug's arranged a fateful blind date for them.\n\nThere were no games played between the pair, who still replay the voicemail a determined Doug sent Kamala ahead of their first date on their anniversaries.\n\nAt the time of their first date, they lived hundreds of miles away from each other with Doug based in Los Angeles and Kamala in San Francisco.\n\nDespite the distance, their first date went well and as Emhoff enthused on YouTube: 'We've been together ever since.'\n\nHis decisiveness let Kamala know he was serious about her and in her memoir she shared how he arranged their second date the morning after their first. Waste no time Sir!\n\nDoug sent her an email including his schedule for the next few months and said: 'I'm too old to play games or hide the ball... I really like you, and I want to see if we can make this work.' And work it did.\n\nKamala's memoir reveals that she initially 'slowed things down' when he wanted her to meet his teenage children.\n\n'As a child of divorce, I knew how hard it can be when your parents start to date other people,' she thoughtfully stated, explaining how she felt it was too soon.\n\n'We agreed to commit to each other for six months, and to re-evaluate our relationship at the end of it,' Kamala shared recounting their rather business-like agreement.\n\nHowever, things went from strength to strength and she did meet his two children, Ella and Cole.\n\nKamala previously told Elle she was 'already hooked don Doug' she stated that it was those two kids that 'reeled her in'.\n\nThey call her 'Momala' and we think that's gorgeous.\n\nShe once told CNN about the 'very modern family' they have as she enjoys a great relationship with Douglas' first wife, Kerstin Emhoff.\n\nAnd with that happy family set up, Doug and Kamala's next step was never in doubt.\n\nAfter about a year of dating, the high-powered duo got engaged and within five months of Doug's proposal, they said 'I do'.\n\nIn August 2014, Kamala and Doug celebrated their nuptials in Santa Barbara having a California courthouse wedding which the politician's sister Maya presided over.\n\nGushing about their love story last year, Doug tweeted: 'We met, fell madly in love (still are), got married and continue to live very happily ever after.'\n\nThe smitten statements are a two-way thing with Kamala telling NowThis: 'I love my husband.\n\n'He is funny, he is kind, he is patient, he loves my cooking. He's just a really great guy.'\n\nThe #DougHive is only swelling in size as he continues to support his wife's trailblazing career, and we have to say, we'll be thoroughly enjoying each and every loved-up post.", "source": {"uri": "evoke.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "EVOKE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_ladies_and_gentlemen_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second ladies and gentlemen of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerstin_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerstin Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber Relationships", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://evoke.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kamala-Harris-Husband-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754603", "eventUri": "eng-9754603", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-", "textStart": 2945, "textEnd": 2956}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

JD Vance criticizing several public figures, including Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.\"\n\n\"It's just a basic fact -- you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC -- the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,\" Vance told Tucker Carlson in a July 2021 interview.\n\nKerstin Emhoff, a film producer, shares two children with Doug Emhoff. The vice president has said her stepchildren refer to her as \"Momala.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Vance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his 2021 statement. Vance is a father of three.\n\nHarris has already faced rounds of attacks on her race and gender. Right wing media have been maligning Harris at an increased clip since President Joe Biden announced he was dropping from the race Sunday and endorsed Harris, slamming the vice president as a \"DEI\" candidate while criticizing everything from her romantic history to the way she laughs.\n\nButtigieg, who was criticized along with Harris in Vance's 2021 interview, told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the remarks came at a time when he and his husband, Chasten, \"had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have known that,\" Buttigieg said, \"but maybe that's why you shouldn't be talking about other people's children.\" (The Buttigiegs welcomed twins in late 2021.)\n\nHarris and Doug Emhoff married in 2014.\n\n\"The thing about blended families,\" Harris told CNN in 2020, \"if everyone approaches it in the way that there's plenty of love to share, then it works.\"\n\nIn a 2019 essay in Elle, Harris discussed becoming close friends with Kerstin Emhoff and sharing a blended family. \"Kerstin and I hit it off ourselves and are dear friends,\" Harris said. \"...

In a since-expired Instagram Story, Ella, 25, shouted out the popstar for her apparent endorsement of her stepmom's presidential campaign.\n\nShortly after it was announced that Harris would be running for the Oval Office, after President Joe Biden stepped out of the race, Charli tweeted, \"kamala IS brat.\" The tweet is a reference to her latest album, also called brat. With the record's release, tons of people have embraced the album's ideas and aesthetic, calling Summer 2024 \"Brat Summer.\"\n\nEmhoff posted a screenshot of the popstar's tweet, and she simply wrote, \"@charli_xcx gets it,\" per Page Six. Emhoff studied fine arts at New York City's Parsons School of Design, and she's been signed to the modeling agency IMG Models since January 2021. It seems safe to say that she's in the main demographic for young people who have been showing love for brat.\n\nCharli was one of the biggest celebrities showing support for Harris after she announced her intentions to jump into the presidential race. Emhoff has also tried to drum up support for her stepmom on her social media. She tried to get followers to register to vote in an Instagram Story on Wednesday, July 24. \"You already know what time it is. This is not the time to sit back and defer the responsibility. This is on all of us to show up, take action and vote for our future. We can be the change we want to see,\" she wrote, while sharing a link to register.\n\nEmhoff is the younger of Harris' two stepkids.

Vance, Kamala Harris Does Have Children -- But That Shouldn't Matter", "body": "It's not exactly news when a conservative white man takes below-the-belt shots at a liberal woman of color (in fact, I think they just call that \"Fox News's afternoon programming block\"), but recently resurfaced comments that Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance made in 2021, referring to the Democratic Party as being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives,\" still manage to feel beyond the pale. (Though he does not mention Vice President Kamala Harris -- now the increasingly likely Democratic presidential nominee -- by name, it's no secret that she has no biological children.)\n\nI probably shouldn't expect much better from Vance -- whose record is heavy on anti-choice, homophobic, and transphobic rhetoric and legislation -- especially in the post-Trump era of reflexive political name-calling. But it's hard not to see his comments as tapping into a deeper cultural anxiety about women who don't adhere to the June Cleaver fantasy of \"family values\" that many members of the GOP still profess to represent.\n\nThe funny thing is that Harris actually does embody those values. She's been married to attorney Doug Emhoff since 2014, and is stepmother to his two adult children, Ella and Cole, who refer to her as \"Momala.\" Harris has noted the strength of her relationship with Emhoff's ex-wife, producer Kerstin Emhoff, as well as her household's close-held routines, writing in 2019: \"Our time as a family is Sunday dinner. We come together, all of us around the table, and over time we've fallen into our roles. Cole sets the table and picks the music, Ella makes beautiful desserts, Doug acts as my sous-chef, and I cook.\"\n\nIt should go without saying that how a person creates or finds family has nothing to do with their value as a person, nor their fitness as a public servant -- but more to the point, would a male presidential candidate ever be raked over the conservative coals for failing to reflect the \"one man, one woman, 2.5 children\" family structure that American culture has idealized since the Cold War? (James Buchanan was famously a bachelor, after all.) There are certainly things to criticize about her record as a politician, but as a half-Black, half-Indian woman nearing the age of 60, Harris's White House family portrait was never going to look like the majority of those that came before it -- and in many ways, that's a good thing.", "source": {"uri": "vogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

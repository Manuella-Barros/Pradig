The former world No.1 was expected to miss the tournament he has won seven times after having knee surgery less than three weeks ago but now appears almost certain to play. His movement was not completely perfect in a 6-3 6-4 win over Medvedev at the Giorgio Armani Tennis Classic at Hurlingham, with Djokovic, who wore strapping on his right knee, showing a reluctance to push off from that leg when out wide, but he served well and struck the ball crisply. Asked about his fitness afterwards, the 37-year-old initially gave a big sigh before saying: \u201cI can tell you that I enjoyed myself really, really much today. TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.READ NOW \u201cI can tell you that pain-free tennis is the best tennis. I was pain-free and I\u2019m really glad. It was a great test obviously against one of the best players in the world. \u201cI\u2019ve played a couple of practice sets but I really wanted to test myself. The test was very successful so I\u2019m obviously really glad. It\u2019s been an intense three weeks after surgery, spending a lot of hours rehabbing. \u201cI kind of always wanted to give myself a chance to be in London. I think my surgeon is here. He\u2019s the MVP for sure the last three weeks. I\u2019m trying to take it day by day and see how far it goes.\u201dCamera IconNovak Djokovic plays a return during training at Wimbledon before his match at nearby Hurlingham. (AP PHOTO) Credit: AAP Djokovic has been leaning on fellow athletes who have suffered similar injuries, including American Taylor Fritz, who faced the same situation three years ago and recovered in time for Wimbledon. \u201cI asked him, I asked many athletes - (Stan) Wawrinka, Lindsey Vonn, Zlatan Ibrahimovic - and they were all very kind to share some of their experiences and give me some contacts of people who could help me out,\u201d Djokovic said. Medvedev did not sense any physical weakness in his opponent but thinks there could still be question marks about how Djokovic will handle the demands of Wimbledon. The World No 5 said: \u201cHe seems to be fine. You never know what he feels inside of him. \u201cIt\u2019s a five-set match on grass (at Wimbledon), never easy for the knee, so I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go during the matches. But he seemed to be moving well, even if I got him off guard a little bit.\u201d Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Email Us Copy the Link Register and have your say.

{"id": 239747946, "title": "Rays get edged in Pittsburgh", "text": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Jared Jones struck out eight, Oneil Cruz homered into the Allegheny River and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 on Saturday. Jones (5-6) overcame some early control issues to allow two runs over seven solid innings to bounce back from a pair of recent shaky starts. The 22-year-old right-hander hit Brandon Lowe and Amed Rosario in the first inning, catching Rosario\u2019s helmet with a 99-mph fastball that forced the third baseman to exit with facial lacerations. Jones then settled down and seemed to get better as the game went along, retiring the final six batters he faced. Asked what his goal was after seeing Rosario go down, Jones replied, \u201cNot wanting to hit a guy in the face again.\u201d \u201cThat was a really scary moment,\u201d Jones said. \u201cJust knowing I got to lock it back in and letting my stuff play through the zone early. I felt like we did a pretty good job of that.\u201d Aroldis Chapman gave up an RBI double to Yandy D\u00edaz with two outs in the ninth but got Isaac Paredes to ground out and earn his second save. Cruz became the fifth player to send a ball to the Allegheny River on the fly when he turned on a Zach Eflin (3-5) pitch in the first and deposited it into the water 445 feet from home plate. \u201cFor sure I hit balls farther in [batting practice],\u201d the 6-foot-7 shortstop said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t count. The ones that count are the ones you hit in the game. Today, I definitely hit it pretty good.\u201d Andrew McCutchen hit his first triple in more than three years for Pittsburgh. Bryan Reynolds singled to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 19 games. Rowdy Tellez and Nick Gonzales also delivered RBIs for Pittsburgh on a scorching day at PNC Park that began with a temperature of 95 degrees. Richie Palacios entered after Rosario\u2019s exit and produced two of Tampa Bay\u2019s five hits as the Rays were held in check by Jones and a pair of relievers less than 24 hours after getting a season-high 17 hits in a victory. Diaz\u2019s two-out RBI double in the ninth extended his hitting streak to a career-best 15 games and his on-base streak to 24. Hagerty High alum Eflin lost for the first time since May 1 when he couldn\u2019t quite match Jones despite retiring the last 14 batters he faced. \u201cHe really stepped up,\u201d Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash said of Eflin. \u201cYou want to win the game \u2014 didn\u2019t want to give up the runs \u2014 but what we needed coming into the game, he gave us that and more.\u201d Pittsburgh produced all the breathing room it would need in the third. The 37-year-old McCutchen \u2014 who believes he can still flash the speed of his prime when necessary \u2014 tripled off the right-field wall with one out, his first three-base hit since April 2021 while playing for Philadelphia and the 50th of his career. The 2013 NL MVP is one of 12 players to have at least 2,000 hits, 400 doubles, 50 triples, 300 home runs and 200 stolen bases, a list that includes Hall of Famers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Frank Robinson. \u201cIt was fun to see him run,\u201d Pirates manager Derek Shelton said of McCutchen. \u201cHe\u2019s still got an extra gear in there. He does.\u201d Reynolds, hitting .342 in June, followed with an RBI single. Tellez produced an RBI single of his own two batters later and Gonzales hit into a run-scoring forceout that gave Jones room to relax. Jones cruised through the later innings and exited to a loud ovation in his first start since getting roughed up for six runs in 4 2/3 innings last weekend against Colorado. \u201cHe had a difficult start there and I think it shows you he\u2019s resilient and that he\u2019s got really good stuff,\u201d Shelton said.

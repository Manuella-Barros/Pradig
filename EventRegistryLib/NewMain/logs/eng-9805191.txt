The statement didn't say what caused the accident.\n\nAt an event in southern Brazil, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva asked the crowd to stand and observe a minute of silence as he shared the news. He said that it appeared that all passengers and crew aboard had died, without elaborating as to how that information had been obtained.\n\nFirefighters, military police and the civil defense authority dispatched teams to the crash site in Vinhedo. Authorities sealed off the entrance to the residential area where the plane went down, as journalists outside watched as official vehicles including ambulances drove in and waited for updates.\n\n\"I thought it was going to fall in our yard,\" a resident and witness who gave her name only as Ana Lucia told reporters near the crash site. \"It was scary, but thank God there were no victims among the locals. It seems that the 62 people inside the plane were the real victims, though.\"\n\nVideo obtained by The Associated Press from a bystander and verified shows at least two bodies strewn about flaming pieces of wreckage.\n\nBrazilian television network GloboNews showed aerial footage of an area with smoke coming out of an obliterated plane fuselage. Additional footage on GloboNews earlier showed the plane drifting downward vertically, spiraling as it fell.\n\nThe Brazilian air force's center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents said in a statement it has a team en route to the crash site. In a separate statement, Brazil's Federal Police said it already had begun its investigation, and is dispatching specialists in plane crashes and the identification of disaster victims to help.\n\nVOEPASS staff at the Guarulhos airport told the AP that the company is notifying victims' family members and supporting them at a private room in the airport, but didn't specify how many victims.\n\nThe plane is an ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop, according to FlightRadar24, a flight tracking website, though VOEPASS didn't immediately confirm that.\n\nThat plane's manufacturer, French-Italian ATR, said in a statement that it had been informed that the accident involved that model of plane, and said company specialists are \"fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer.\"\n\nThe ATR 72 generally is used on shorter flights.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nVINHEDO, Brazil (AP) -- A plane with 62 people aboard crashed in a fiery wreck in a residential area of a city in Brazil's Sao Paulo state Friday, the airline said, but it was not immediately clear how many people were injured or killed.\n\nThe airline VOEPASS confirmed in a statement that a plane headed for Sao Paulo's international airport Guarulhos crashed inside a gated community in the city of Vinhedo with 58 passengers and 4 crew members aboard. The statement didn't say what caused the accident.\n\nAt an event in southern Brazil, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva asked the crowd to stand and observe a minute of silence as he shared the news. He said that it appeared that all passengers and crew aboard had died, without elaborating as to how that information had been obtained.\n\nFirefighters, military police and the civil defense authority dispatched teams to the crash site in Vinhedo. Authorities sealed off the entrance to the residential area where the plane went down, as journalists outside watched as official vehicles including ambulances drove in and waited for updates.\n\n\"I thought it was going to fall in our yard,\" a resident and witness who gave her name only as Ana Lucia told reporters near the crash site. \"It was scary, but thank God there were no victims among the locals. It seems that the 62 people inside the plane were the real victims, though.\"\n\nVideo obtained by The Associated Press from a bystander and verified shows at least two bodies strewn about flaming pieces of wreckage.\n\nBrazilian television network GloboNews showed aerial footage of an area with smoke coming out of an obliterated plane fuselage. Additional footage on GloboNews earlier showed the plane drifting downward vertically, spiraling as it fell.\n\nThe Brazilian air force's center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents said in a statement it has a team en route to the crash site. In a separate statement, Brazil's Federal Police said it already had begun its investigation, and is dispatching specialists in plane crashes and the identification of disaster victims to help.\n\nVOEPASS staff at the Guarulhos airport told the AP that the company is notifying victims' family members and supporting them at a private room in the airport, but didn't specify how many victims.\n\nThe plane is an ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop, according to FlightRadar24, a flight tracking website, though VOEPASS didn't immediately confirm that.\n\nThat plane's manufacturer, French-Italian ATR, said in a statement that it had been informed that the accident involved that model of plane, and said company specialists are \"fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer.\"\n\nThe ATR 72 generally is used on shorter flights. The planes are built by a joint venture of Airbus in France and Italy's Leonardo S.p.A. Crashes involving various models of the ATR 72 have resulted in 470 deaths going back to the 1990s, according to a database of the Aviation Safety Network.\n\nThe Capela neighborhood where the plane crashed sits in a district far from the center of the prosperous city that's home to 77,000 residents.\n\nThe plane departed from Cascavel, in the state of Parana.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Aircraft Crashes in Brazil - The Trent", "body": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil -- A passenger plane carrying 58 passengers and four crew members crashed in Brazil on Friday, August 9, 2024, according to a statement from the airline Voepass Linhas A\u00e9reas.\n\nThe aircraft, operating as flight 2283, had departed from Cascavel in the state of Paran\u00e1 and was en route to S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport when it went down near the city of Vinhedo, just outside S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe airline has not yet provided information on the cause of the crash or the condition of those on board.\n\nHowever, local media outlets have reported significant damage, with Brazil's Civil Defense confirming that the plane struck multiple houses during its descent.\n\nDramatic footage captured by Brazil's TV GloboNews showed the plane spiraling out of control before crashing, followed by images of fire and smoke rising from the crash site.\n\nThe area surrounding the crash was quickly engulfed in flames, as seen in videos shared on social media.\n\nAccording to flight tracking data from Flightradar24, the Voepass aircraft lost signal shortly before 1:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. ET) as it approached S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe cause of the loss of control remains unknown at this time.\n\nIn a statement, Voepass Linhas A\u00e9reas expressed deep concern and stated that they are cooperating fully with authorities to determine what led to the crash.\n\n\"There is still no confirmation of how the accident occurred or the current situation of the people on board,\" the airline said.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, while speaking at an event, referenced the plane crash, saying it \"appears\" all the passengers have died in the plane crash.\n\n\"I would like everyone to stand up so that we can observe a minute of silence because a plane has just crashed in the city of Vinhedo, in S\u00e3o Paulo, with 58 passengers and 4 crew members and it appears

It was not immediately clear how many people were injured or killed but the country's president said everyone on board was presumed dead.\n\nThe airline VOEPASS confirmed in a statement that a plane headed for Sao Paulo's international airport Guarulhos crashed inside a gated community in the city of Vinhedo with 58 passengers and 4 crew members aboard. The statement didn't say what caused the accident.\n\nAt an event in southern Brazil, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva asked the crowd to stand and observe a minute of silence as he shared the news. He said that it appeared that all passengers and crew aboard had died, without elaborating as to how that information had been obtained.\n\n\"Very sad,\" he wrote on social media. \"All my solidarity to the families and friends of the victims.\"\n\nFirefighters, military police and the civil defense authority dispatched teams to the crash site in Vinhedo, the government said in a statement.\n\nAuthorities sealed off the entrance to the residential area where the plane went down, as journalists outside watched as official vehicles including ambulances drove in and waited for updates.\n\n\"I thought it was going to fall in our yard,\" a resident and witness who gave her name only as Ana Lucia told reporters near the crash site. \"It was scary, but thank God there were no victims among the locals. It seems that the 62 people inside the plane were the real victims, though.\"\n\nVideo obtained by The Associated Press from a bystander and verified shows at least two bodies strewn about flaming pieces of wreckage.\n\nBrazilian television network GloboNews showed aerial footage of an area with smoke coming out of an obliterated plane fuselage. Additional footage on GloboNews earlier showed the plane drifting downward vertically, spiraling as it fell.\n\nThe Brazilian air force's center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents said in a statement it has a team en route to the crash site. In a separate statement, Brazil's Federal Police said it already had begun its investigation, and is dispatching specialists in plane crashes and the identification of disaster victims to help.\n\nVOEPASS staff at the Guarulhos airport told the AP that the company is notifying victims' family members and supporting them at a private room in the airport, but didn't specify how many victims.\n\nThe plane is an ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop, according to Flight tracker FlightRadar24, a flight tracking website, though VOEPASS didn't immediately confirm that.\n\nFlightRadar24 said in a social media post that in the area where the plane crashed, there was an \"active warning for severe icing\" between 12,000 feet and 21,000 feet. FlightRadar24 said the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet just before the crash.\n\nThat plane's manufacturer, French-Italian ATR, said in a statement that it had been informed that the accident involved that model of plane, and said company specialists are \"fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer.\"\n\nThe ATR 72 generally is used on shorter flights. The planes are built by a joint venture of Airbus in France and Italy's Leonardo S.p.A. Crashes involving various models of the ATR 72 have resulted in 470 deaths going back to the 1990s, according to a database of the Aviation Safety Network.\n\nThe Capela neighborhood where the plane crashed sits in a district far from the center of the prosperous city that's home to 77,000 residents.\n\nThe plane departed from Cascavel, in the state of Parana.\n\nThe crash comes less than a year after 12 people, including a baby, died in a plane crash in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nNathalie Cicari, who lives near the crash site, told CNN Brasil the impact was \"terrifying.\"\n\n\"I was having lunch, I heard a very loud noise very close by,\" she said, describing the sound as drone-like but \"much louder.\"\n\n\"I went out on the balcony and saw the plane spinning. Within seconds, I realized that it was not a normal movement for a plane,\" she told the broadcaster.\n\nCicari was not hurt but had to evacuate her house, which was filled with black smoke from the crash.\n\nTeams of firefighters, military police and state civil defense were deployed in the Capela neighborhood, in Vinhedo.\n\nThe doomed plane recorded its first flight in April 2010, according to the website planespotters.net.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki",

The statement didn't say what caused the accident.\n\nAt an event in southern Brazil, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva asked the crowd to stand and observe a minute of silence as he shared the news. He said that it appeared that all passengers and crew aboard had died, without elaborating as to how that information had been obtained.\n\nFirefighters, military police and the civil defense authority dispatched teams to the crash site in Vinhedo. Authorities sealed off the entrance to the residential area where the plane went down, as journalists outside watched as official vehicles including ambulances drove in and waited for updates.\n\n\"I thought it was going to fall in our yard,\" a resident and witness who gave her name only as Ana Lucia told reporters near the crash site. \"It was scary, but thank God there were no victims among the locals. It seems that the 62 people inside the plane were the real victims, though.\"\n\nVideo obtained by The Associated Press from a bystander and verified shows at least two bodies strewn about flaming pieces of wreckage.\n\nBrazilian television network GloboNews showed aerial footage of an area with smoke coming out of an obliterated plane fuselage. Additional footage on GloboNews earlier showed the plane drifting downward vertically, spiraling as it fell.\n\nThe Brazilian air force's center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents said in a statement it has a team en route to the crash site. In a separate statement, Brazil's Federal Police said it already had begun its investigation, and is dispatching specialists in plane crashes and the identification of disaster victims to help.\n\nVOEPASS staff at the Guarulhos airport told the AP that the company is notifying victims' family members and supporting them at a private room in the airport, but didn't specify how many victims.\n\nThe plane is an ATR 72-500 twin-engine turboprop, according to FlightRadar24, a flight tracking website, though VOEPASS didn't immediately confirm that.\n\nThat plane's manufacturer, French-Italian ATR, said in a statement that it had been informed that the accident involved that model of plane, and said company specialists are \"fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer.\"\n\nThe ATR 72 generally is used on shorter flights. The planes are built by a joint venture of Airbus in France and Italy's Leonardo S.p.A. Crashes involving various models of the ATR 72 have resulted in 470 deaths going back to the 1990s, according to a database of the Aviation Safety Network.\n\nThe Capela neighborhood where the plane crashed sits in a district far from the center of the prosperous city that's home to 77,000 residents.\n\nThe plane departed from Cascavel, in the state of Parana.\n\n-- -- -\n\nAP videojournalist

Dramatic footage from the scene showed the plane's fall and its destroyed fuselage in flames on the ground.\n\n\"There are no survivors,\" Ana C\u00e2ndida Briski, communications director of the nearby city of Valinhos, told CNN, adding that there were no ground victims.\n\nFlight tracking data shows that the Voepass Linhas A\u00e9reas dropped 17,000 feet in just one minute, but it is not clear what caused the twin-engine turboprop plane to fall. \"There is still no confirmation of how the accident occurred or the current situation of the people on board,\" according to a statement by airline Voepass.\n\nInterrupting a speech at an afternoon naval event to address the crash, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva called for a minute of silence to mark the apparent deaths of the flight's passengers and crew.\n\n\"I would like everyone to stand up so that we can observe a minute of silence because a plane has just crashed in the city of Vinhedo, in S\u00e3o Paulo, with 58 passengers and 4 crew members and it appears they all died,\" he said, in a video of his statement shared on X.\n\nSocial media videos of the crash showed the plane spiraling out of the sky before hitting the ground as people in the neighborhood shouted in fear. Another video showed the wreckage of the plane in flames on the ground.\n\nThe flight left Cascavel, in the Brazilian state of Parana, and was en route to Guarulhos, in S\u00e3o Paulo state, when it lost signal shortly before 1:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. ET), according to Flightradar24 data.\n\nIt began losing altitude a minute and a half before crashing. The plane had been cruising at 17,000 feet until 1:21 p.m. local time, when it dropped approximately 250 feet in 10 seconds. It then climbed approximately 400 feet in about eight seconds.\n\nEight seconds later, it lost just under 2,000 feet. Then, in approximately one minute, it began rapidly descending -- roughly 17,000 feet in just one minute.\n\nThe last data transmission from the plane was at 1:22 p.m. local time.\n\nOne resident recorded video of the aftermath of a plane crashing into her neighbor's house outside of S\u00e3o Paulo, telling CNN's Julia Vargas Jones she was eating lunch in her kitchen when she saw the plane going down.\n\nShe ducked down in terror and started praying, she said, calling it a \"moment of panic\" for the whole city. The private roads leading up to the properties are closed off to everyone, including residents. She said the woman told her first responders were in the area.\n\nThe crashed aircraft, registration PS-VPB, is an ATR 72-500 and has a total capacity of 74.\n\nFlight experts speaking to CNN said ATR 72s, which are constructed by a European consortium, have a checkered past. ATR 72's, as well as the company's similar, but smaller ATR 42 designation, have previously been involved in a number of accidents: There have been at least 15 incidents resulting in passenger deaths involving ATR turboprops recorded around the world.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The plane, an ATR-72 twin-engine turboprop, was en route from Cascavel in Paran\u00e1 to Guarulhos, S\u00e3o Paulo's main airport, when it crashed in the city of Vinhedo.\n\nThe incident unfolded with horrifying speed. Video footage circulating on social media shows the plane spiraling downward before crashing into a residential area. The crash resulted in a large fire, with black smoke billowing from what appeared to be the plane's fuselage amidst the houses. The immediate aftermath of the crash has not been fully determined, with authorities still working to ascertain the number of casualties and the exact cause of the accident.\n\nVoePass confirmed the crash but did not provide details about what might have led to the disaster. \"There is still no confirmation of how the accident occurred or the current situation of the people on board,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nThe airline's initial response focused on coordinating with local emergency services, who were quickly dispatched to the scene. Firefighters, military police, and civil defense teams are on-site, working to manage the situation and assist any possible survivors.\n\nThe crash has sent shockwaves throughout Brazil. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, while attending an event in southern Brazil, interrupted his speech to observe a minute of silence in honor of the victims.\n\nHe expressed his condolences, saying, \"Very sad. All my solidarity to the families and friends of the victims.\" His words echoed the grief and uncertainty felt by many as they await further news about the incident.\n\nThe crash site, located in a residential area, has posed additional challenges for the emergency response teams. Local hospitals have been alerted and are on standby to receive any survivors. However, the scale of the fire and the extent of the damage have raised concerns about the survival of those on board.\n\nAs investigations begin, Brazil and the global aviation community will be watching closely to understand what led to this devastating accident.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Paulo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voepass_Linhas_A\u00e9reas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voepass Linhas A\u00e9reas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloster_Meteor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gloster Meteor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR_72", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATR 72"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turboprop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteoroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascavel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cascavel"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cascavel"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarulhos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guarulhos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guarulhos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paran\u00e1_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paran\u00e1 (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paran\u00e1 (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinhedo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vinhedo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vinhedo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/1c92b324dffe5ba014e050efd82f606a/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/08/09/17232286082166.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805191", "eventUri": "eng-9805191", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Shocked residents could be heard shouting in panic as they watched the horrifying scene unfold.\n\nLocal emergency services quickly responded to the incident, but tragically, none of the 58 passengers and 4 crew members survived the impact. One resident in the area sustained injuries as the plane tore through the neighborhood, but there were no additional casualties on the ground.\n\nAccording to ABC News, the disaster struck just before 1:30 p.m. local time, shortly after the plane lost contact with air traffic control. The wreckage, still burning hours later, was cordoned off by authorities as they began the grim task of recovery and investigation.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, visibly moved, broke the news of the crash during a public event, asking attendees to join him in a moment of silence to honor the victims. \"It's a moment of great sorrow for all of us,\" he said, acknowledging the lives lost in the tragedy.\n\nResidents of Vinhedo described the event as surreal and horrifying. One woman, who witnessed the plane's descent while having lunch, recounted the sheer terror as she realized the aircraft was heading straight for her neighborhood. \"It was a moment of pure panic,\" she told CNN, recalling how she instinctively ducked for cover and began to pray.\n\nAuthorities have closed off the streets surrounding the crash site, and investigators from Brazil's civil aviation agency have been dispatched to determine what led to the plane's sudden and catastrophic failure.

Data from FlightRadar24 showed the aircraft cruising at 17,000 feet (5,190 meters) until it entered a seemingly uncontrollable flat spin while banking right for Sao Paulo and crashed to the ground in a residential area of Vinhedo two minutes later.\n\nVoepass said 58 passengers and four crew members were on board. Emergency services rushed to the scene but local authorities announced shortly afterwards that there were no survivors.\n\nVideo footage posted on social media captured the turboprop aircraft's final moments as it spiraled toward the ground.\n\nFootage from the crash site showed a pile of flaming wreckage. It is unclear whether there were any casualties on the ground.\n\nSpeaking at a military event in the southern city of Itajai, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva held a minute's silence for the victims of the crash.\n\nThe cause of the crash is still unknown. In aviation, a flat spin typically occurs when a plane's center of gravity shifts too far towards its tail, pitching its nose up and reducing airflow over the wings. With less air flowing over the wings, the plane loses altitude, and any subsequent horizontal rotation can cause it to enter an uncontrollable spin. With reduced air flow over control surfaces, recovering from such a spin can be extremely difficult, particularly on larger aircraft.

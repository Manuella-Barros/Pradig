Dr Clare Bailey Mosley spoke after the body of her 67-year-old husband was found close to a secluded beach resort on the sunshine island of Symi. His body was found behind a small wall and chain link fence which circles the secluded, picturesque resort of Agia Marina. He had veered off a rocky path which leads to the bar and it is believed he may passed out in the 40C heat or fallen on the dangerous terrain. If he had managed to make it another few yards, then he would have reached the sea and a gate into the resort. The distinctive purple umbrella he had been carrying at the time was close to him. Wife's heartbreaking statement Yesterday wife Clare said: \u201cI don\u2019t know quite where to begin with this. It\u2019s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together. I am incredibly proud of our children, their resilience and support over the past days. \u201cMy family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It\u2019s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you.\u201d She said Michael had died after taking the \u201cwrong route\u201d over a dangerous rocky terrain towards the secluded beach resort Agia Marina. \u201cWe\u2019re taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team. \u201cMichael was an adventurous man, it\u2019s part of what made him so special. We are so grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi who have worked tirelessly to help find him. \u201cSome of these people on the island, who hadn\u2019t even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked. We\u2019re also very grateful to The Press who have dealt with us with great respect. I feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends. Most of all, I feel so lucky to have had this life with Michael. Thank you all.\u201d 'It's him' Dr Mosley\u2019s was one of Britain\u2019s best known TV doctors. His body was found just 50 yards from the entrance of the beach bar. Police yesterday confirmed it was his body. Petros Vassilakis, a senior police official, said: \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d He was identified by his personal belongings and clothes. Just 24 hours earlier search teams, including Dr Mosley\u2019s children, had been within 200 yards of his body as they retraced his steps. Dr Mosley left wife Clare at St Nicholas beach on Wednesday afternoon at 1.30pm, heading towards the village of Pedi. CCTV picked him up walking through the village. The last sighting was security camera footage from a house at the end of the bay in Pedi which showed him striding up a hill towards Agia Marina. The walk from St Nicholas beach to where the body was found is around three miles and would have taken a couple of hours. Police are working on the theory he had been dead for \u2018several days\u2019. Yesterday afternoon emergency workers arrived at the bar to examine the scene and remove the body. They placed him on an orange stretcher before he was taken away in a small waiting boat. The body was found by staff at the beach bar after being alerted by the island\u2019s mayor. Eleftherios Papakalodouka had joined a Greek TV crew to film the coastline where the search was taking place when they spotted something \u201cunusual\u201d. Bar manager Ilias Tsavaris said he had been sent up to have a look following the alert when he saw the \u2018glint from a watch\u2019 and a body. He said: 'The mayor had been here to give interviews to the media and then left on a boat to return to Pedi. From the sea he saw something unusual and then he called the restaurant and asked them to check it out. \u201cI was sent up there and as I turned the fence to go up I saw a glint from a watch and then I saw the body at the same time. You don\u2019t see a dead body every day, it\u2019s not a warzone, it\u2019s summer and you\u2019re supposed to have fun and swim.\u201d Kids' heartbreaking trip to Symi Dr Mosley's grown-up children Alex, Jack, Dan and Kate had arrived at the island on Saturday to join their mother Clare in the search He was known for his bubbly personality and had released a string of best-selling books. He was well known for popularising the 5:2 diet. Dr Mosley and his wife landed on the small, 25-square-mile island last Tuesday to stay for a week with a couple who have a house in Symi Town. The two couples took a boat up the coast on Wednesday morning. They stopped at Saint Nicholas beach where he went for a swim in the sea before deciding to walk the 2.2 miles back to the house for his mobile. But when Dr Bailey and the couple returned they found he had not returned and raised the alarm. Tributes started to flood in yesterday after the tragic news of his death broke. Academic and broadcaster Alice Roberts who first worked with him on her 2009 TV series Human Journey: \u201cThe fragility of life is so shocking.

My thoughts are with his bereaved family.\" Mosley's co-presenter on Trust Me, I'm A Doctor, Dr Saleyha Ahsan described him as a \"national treasure\" and a \u201chugely talented\u201d man.

According to a report by TMZ, Lauren Pisciottahas has accused Kanye West of wrongful termination, among other things. The former personal assistant alleges that 'he (Kanye West) gave her the boot after sending her vile sexual texts and videos.'\n\nThe TMZ report also states that Lauren Pisciotta is suing the rapper for breach of contract, sexual harassment, and hostile work environment.\n\nLauren Pisciotta claims that Kanye West would masturbate during phone conversations with her and ask if she could hear or guess what he was doing. She reportedly also claims that he was fixated with the size of her boyfriend's penis.\n\nFor those unaware, Kanye West hired Lauren Pisciotta back in July 2021 after meeting her while putting his fashion line Yeezy together. Pisciotta also claimed to have worked with West on three songs from his 2021 album Donda.\n\nA year later, Pisciotta says West told her that he wanted her to be 'God-like,' asking her to delete her OnlyFans account, which she reportedly agreed to because he promised to pay her $1 million a year if she did so.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by LP\u2728 (@laurenpisciotta)\n\nSome personal texts between the two have also been made public. In one of the texts, shared by TMZ, Kanye West is seen writing to Lauren Pisciotta the following: \"See my problem is I be wanting to f*cu but then after I f*ck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f**ked while I'm f**king them. Then I want her to cheat on me...\"\n\nTMZ reported that 'it gets really vulgar after that - with more alleged texts sent from Lauren that describe Kanye's sexual fantasies with women, including a lot of explicit language.' One of them read: \"Is my d**k racist? It is. This f***ing racist d**k of mine. I going to beat this f***ing racist d**k for being f***ing racist. I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black asses and beat the s**t out of my racist d**k... Beating the s**t out of his big black c**k.\"\n\nAdditionally, according to the lawsuit, there were sexual videos and photos that were sent to Pisciotta, including at least two videos of West having sex with a model. The TMZ report also states that while dealing with Kanye West's alleged behavior, Lauren Pisciotta said she was promoted to Chief of Staff for his various companies, earning a $4 million salary. She was fired in October 2022, but claims she was offered a $3 million severance package, which she accepted, but has not received.\n\nSee Also: Kanye West Faces Backlash For Comments About Michelle Obama: 'Gotta F**k The President's Wife!'", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_work_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostile work environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(2008)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backlash (2008)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_in/photo/default/4cover_1myv.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

This latest suit comes two months after a former employee accused him of discrimination and harassment.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by The Blast, the rapper has been accused of sexual harassment and wrongful termination.\n\nPer the lawsuit, Kanye West's former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, worked in the music industry for approximately 15 years and has held positions in and as Artist Management and Representation, A&R, Marketing Consultant and Project Management.\n\nDue to her success, Ms. Pisciotta interacted professionally with many artists, including Kanye West, AKA Ye. She creatively collaborated with the rapper on the Yeezy Season I women's fashion line and placed three songs on \"Donda,\" his 10th studio album, which was eventually released in 2021.\n\nAround July 2021, Ms. Pisciotta was \"requested that she serve as [Ye's] Executive Assistant/Personal Assistant in connection with the business affairs of all defendants herein and the personal affairs\" of the rapper.\n\nAt the time, Ye stated to Ms. Pisciotta that \"he was impressed with her prior tenures as [his] employee, and they agreed on a salary for Ms. Pisciotta of $1,000,000 per year,\" but required she be available \"24/7.\"\n\nShe accepted the salary.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Kayne West was \"aware\" of the accuser's \"strong social media presence, comprised of Ms. Pisciotta's Instagram and an OnlyFans accounts, the latter of which was run entirely by an independent management company, and he did not have any issue or objection to it.\"\n\nHer social media generated approximately $1,000,000 annually.\n\nPer the suit, Ye later \"boasted\" to friends that Ms. Pisciotta was \"an OnlyFans Superstar.\"\n\n\"[Her] social media presence included but was not limited to Instagram and OnlyFans and content of, among other things, professional bikini and lingerie photographs as a result of professional and tasteful photoshoots,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nIn and around August 2022, Kanye West reportedly asked Ms. Pisciotta to be \"God like\" and asked her to delete her OnlyFans account. If she agreed, he said he would pay her $1,000,000.\n\nShe decided to move forward, thereby giving up the annual sums generated from her OnlyFans. Ye allegedly never paid her.\n\nMs. Pisciotta also claims Kanye West began to send a series of text messages, including one that read:\n\n\"See my problem is I be wanting to f-ck but then after I f-ck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f-cked while I'm f-cking them. Then I want her to cheat on me ...\"\n\nAnother text she claims she received from Ye reads:\n\n\"Is my d-ck racist? It is. This f-cking racist d-ck of mine. I going to beat this f-cking racist d-ck for being f-cking racist. I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black as--es and beat the sh-t out of my racist -ck ... Beating the h-t out of his big black c-ck.\"\n\nThe suit then claims that Kanye West \"engaged in a systematic, severe and persuasive and offensive campaign of unlawful harassment based on [Ms. Pisciotta's] sex, including sexual harassment, in violation of various provisions of FEHA.\"\n\nMs. Pisciotta claims that he m-sturbated in front of her, and over-shared intimate sexual details, photos, texts and videos of sex acts, \"including without limitation acts that [Ye] was engaged in and other pictures and videos of Instagram models, current and former YEEZY, LLC employees and various men and women.\"\n\nOn or about October 21, 2022, Ms. Pisciotta was terminated from employment and was offered $3,000,000, which she accepted.

Several teachers have alleged that the school has multiple health and safety violations, which they claim West has ignored.\n\nAn attorney for West denied the claims and asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. \"None of it is true and the allegations do a disservice to the Donda Academy's current staff and students and their parents who will attest to their positive experience,\" attorney Gregory Suhr said in court docs obtained by NBC News in June 2023.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_simpson@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kaitlin Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_work_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostile work environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donda Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kanye-West-Sued-for-Sexual-Harassment-by-Former-Assistant.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 64, "textEnd": 70}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The musician and fashion designer was sued for sexual harassment by his former assistant according to TMZ. Lauren Pisciotta also accuses West of breach of contract, wrongful termination, and hostile work environment.\n\nPisciotta, a former OnlyFans model, was hired by West in July 2021 after they met when West was putting together a fashion line. She also says she collaborated with him and worked on three songs on West's Donda album.\n\nPisciotta says that West approached her after these collaborations and asked her to delete her OnlyFans account, citing his desire for her to be \"God like.\" West promised to pay her a $1 million per year if she did, so Pisciotta agreed. However, according to Pisciotta, things went left shortly after. She claims that she received a series of vulgar texts from West, like this one:\n\n\"See my problem is I be wanting to f*ck but then after I f*ck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f*cked while I'm f*cking them. Then I want her to cheat on me ...\"\n\nAnd this one:\n\n\"Is my d*** racist? It is. This f*cking racist d*** of mine. I going to beat this f*cking racist d*** for being f*cking racist.

She claims West was also fixated on the size of her boyfriend's penis. The lawsuit states that Pisciotta received a slew of text messages, sexual videos, and sexual photos from West, including two videos of him having sex with a model. After all of this, Pisciotta was promoted to Chief Staff for West's companies with a salary of $4 million. It was short-lived, however, as Pisciotta was fired in October 2022.

That year, Pisciotta said that West hired her as his \"Executive Assistant/Personal Assistant\" and offered her an annual salary of $1 million dollars on the condition that she was available to him \"24-7,\" which she accepted as a full-time employee of the artist.\n\nAt the time, Pisciotta claimed she was making $1 million annually from OnlyFans and through other social media platforms. Although West had no objection to her OnlyFans account at first, per the suit, in 2022, he allegedly stated that he wanted Pisciotta to be \"God like\" and asked her to delete her account in exchange for $1 million. After she deleted her account, Pisciotta said she received a barrage of explicit messages from West, and that at one point, he masturbated in front of her.\n\nIn one text message, per the filing, West allegedly wrote: \"See my problem is I be wanting to fuck but then after I fuck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been fucked while I'm fucking them,\" before adding \"Then I want her to cheat on me.\"\n\nPisciotta also alleged the West would instruct her to deliver him a sexual enhancement \"honey\" before his sexual encounters, was \"fixated on the penis size\" of her boyfriends, and would also send her photos and videos of himself having sex with a model.\n\nIn another message, West allegedly asks Pisciotta, \"Is my dick racist?\" and adds, \"I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black asses and beat the shit out of my racist dick.\"\n\nPisciotta also claimed that when speaking with West under the guise of discussing work-related matters, he would masturbate while on the phone with her.\n\nIn another disturbing claim, the suit describes an incident that allegedly took place during an overnight flight to Paris where other Yeezy employees were present. Pisciotta claimed that after West said that he needed to talk to her, he shut the door to his room on the plane, trapping the two of them inside as the door was unable to be opened from inside. West then allegedly laid down on his bed as she sat in a chair across from him, and he began to masturbate under the covers until he fell asleep.\n\nAround September 2022, the suit states that Pisciotta was promoted to Chief of Staff for his various companies, and was told she would receive an additional $3 million for her promotion. However, the following month, Pisciotta stated she was fired and allegedly offered a $3 million severance package, which she accepted but did not receive.\n\nIn addition to sexual harassment, breach of contract, and wrongful termination, Pisciotta is also suing West and his affiliated Yeezy companies for fraud, unpaid wages, and intentional infliction of emotion distress.\n\nThis isn't the first time West has been publicly affiliated with explicit content. In November 2022, Rolling Stone reported that multiple former Yeezy employees claimed West showed them pornography and inappropriate photos of his then-wife Kim Kardashian, among other alleged tactics of intimidation and control. In the past, West has referred to a \"full-on pornography addiction\" that \"destroyed my family\" and to sex as a design inspiration.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charisma_madarang@rollingstone.com", "name": "Charisma Madarang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisciotta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kanye-west-lawsuit-assistant.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Lauren Pisciotta, who worked as West's assistant for two years, filed the lawsuit on Monday, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Pisciotta claims that West sent her lewd text messages, including pornographic videos, and performed sex acts while on the phone with her. She alleges that on one occasion, West \"trapped\" her in a private room on his plane and masturbated in front of her.\n\nPisciotta alleges that she was initially hired by West in 2021 to work on the first season of his Yeezy women's fashion line, with an annual salary of $1 million. According to the lawsuit, West initially allowed Pisciotta to continue her OnlyFans business, but in 2022, he allegedly asked her to delete her account in exchange for an additional $1 million.\n\nAfter Pisciotta closed her OnlyFans account, she claims that West bombarded her with explicit text messages and videos. The lawsuit further alleges that around September 2022, Pisciotta was promoted to Chief of Staff for West's various companies but was abruptly fired soon afterward, with her $3 million severance package never being paid.\n\nIn addition to sexual harassment, breach of contract, and wrongful termination, Pisciotta is also suing West and his Yeezy businesses for fraud, unpaid wages, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThis is not the first time West has faced accusations of lewd behavior. Last November, multiple employees of his Yeezy fashion line told Rolling Stone that he had played pornographic films during staff meetings and shown an intimate photograph of his then-wife Kim Kardashian in job interviews.\n\nWest has not responded to the latest allegations, and his lawyer has not yet provided a comment to the BBC, which has been unable to independently verify the filing of the lawsuit. The rapper, who has faced numerous controversies in recent years, including the termination of his lucrative contract with Adidas over antisemitic comments, has previously acknowledged a \"full-on pornography addiction\" that he said \"destroyed\" his family.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "entertainment_desk@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Entertainment Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intentional infliction of emotional distress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/kanyee1717498769-0/kanyee1717498769-0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

In April, a former employee at West's private school, Donda Academy, alleged in a lawsuit that the star wanted to install a jail so that students \"could be locked in cages.\"\n\nPisciotta is suing West over sexual harassment, wrongful termination, and breach of contract. She is also suing West and his affiliated Yeezy companies over intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud and unpaid wages.\n\nIn the court filing, Pisciotta said she was already making $1 million per year at the time of West's offer through social media platforms, including OnlyFans, which is favored by adult content creators. She said that while West did not initially voice an objection to her OnlyFans account, he asked her in 2022 to delete it in exchange for $1 million, as he wanted her to be \"God like,\" Rolling Stone reported.\n\nPisciotta said she obliged with her then-employer's request, and he began sending her sexually explicit messages.\n\n\"See my problem is I be wanting to f**k but then after I f**k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f****d while I'm f*****g them,\" read one message the filing said West sent to Pisciotta.

She added that West was \"fixated on the penis size\" of the men she dated.\n\nThe former employee said in the filing that when she spoke with West on the phone about work matters, he would masturbate. She also said that on a flight to Paris with other Yeezy employees, he said he needed to speak with her in his room, where he shut the door, which could be opened only from the outside. Pisciotta said West then masturbated under the covers until he fell asleep as she sat on a chair opposite him.\n\nPisciotta said in her suit that she was promoted to chief of staff for West's various companies around September 2022 and was informed that she would be paid an additional $3 million for her position. According to the complaint, she was fired the following month. She said that while she accepted an offer of a $3 million severance package, she was never paid.\n\nIn November 2022, West faced sexual harassment accusations after a Rolling Stone article detailed allegations that he showed pornography and explicit photos and videos of his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, in meetings with Yeezy and Adidas staff.\n\nIn April, Trevor Phillips, a former Yeezy and Donda Academy staffer, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that West made antisemitic remarks, compared himself to Adolf Hitler and showed preferential treatment to white staff members.\n\nDonda Academy, a Christian K-12 school in Simi Valley, California, is named after West's late mother, Professor Donda West. On its website, the school said its mission was to \"prepare students to become the next generation of leaders.\"\n\nThe school has been plagued by controversy since its 2022 opening. In October 2022, Jason Angell, Donda Academy's principal, said in an email that the school was abruptly closing. It reopened soon afterward. Though Phillips' lawsuit said the school eventually closed in August 2023, it added that \"on information and belief, Donda Academy still operates to this day.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_smith@newsweek.com", "name": "Ryan Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intentional infliction of emotional distress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donda Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donda West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simi_Valley,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simi Valley, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Simi Valley, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2403342/kanye-ye-west-sued.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4ea30299883a20e78c0bf23e859eaecd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

However, soon after assuming the role, Pisciotta claims that the \"Real Friends\" artist began sending her inappropriate sexual messages, making crude requests of her.\n\nInside the eyebrow-raising complaint, Pisciotta alleged that Ye once requested that she deliver him sexual enhancement \"honey\" before one of his sexual encounters and would often send videos of himself having sexual intercourse with women.\n\nIn one message, Pisciotta claimed that she received a text from the Grammy Award-winning rapper asking, \"Is my d-ck racist?\" In a follow-up message, he allegedly stated, \"I'm going to stare at pictures of white women with black asses and beat the shit out of my racist d-ck.\"\n\nPer the lawsuit, while working for the \"Good Life\" rapper, Pisciotta alleged that the celeb would masturbate on the phone with her as they tried to discuss business matters. In a startling moment on a flight destined for Paris, Pisciotta claimed that Ye requested her presence in his room, locking them both inside as the door proved inoperable from within. Pisciotta alleged that she sat on a chair directly across from Ye's bed, where he lay masturbating under the covers until he fell asleep.\n\n\"She also claimed that he got angry after she shut down any advances to 'date or have sex' with him,\" Page Six noted.\n\nPisciotta was terminated in October 2022, just a month after being promoted to Chief of Staff for various business endeavors of the rapper. She was allegedly offered a $3 million salary for her promotion, which she allegedly never received, the lawsuit states. Pisciotta also claimed she was promised a $3 million severance package by Ye, which was never fulfilled.\n\nThe former assistant is seeking compensation for breach of contract and a hostile work environment.

She says she agreed to the terms.\n\nLauren Pisciotta says she had 15 years experience in the music industry before working with West\n\nAccording to her lawsuit, West was initially comfortable with her continuing her OnlyFans business.\n\nHowever, in 2022, he allegedly stated that he wanted Pisciotta to be \"God like\" and asked her to delete her account in exchange for a further $1 million.\n\nAfter she closed the account, she claims she was bombarded with explicit text messages from West, including pornographic videos.\n\nMs Pisciotta also claims he masturbated while talking to her on the phone and that, on one occasion, he pleasured himself in front of her after \"trapping\" her in a private room on his plane.\n\nAround September 2022, she was promoted to Chief of Staff for his various companies, but was abruptly fired soon afterwards, her lawsuit claims.\n\nHer severance package was allegedly never paid.\n\nIn addition to sexual harassment, breach of contract, and wrongful termination, Pisciotta is also suing West and his Yeezy businesses for fraud, unpaid wages, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThis is not the first time the rapper has been accused of lewd behaviour.\n\nLast November, multiple employees of his Yeezy fashion line told Rolling Stone he had played pornographic films during staff meetings, and showed an intimate photograph of his then-wife Kim Kardashian in job interviews.\n\nWest has not responded to the allegations at the time, and has maintained his silence ever since.\n\nIn the past, the star has referred to a \"full-on pornography addiction\" that \"destroyed my family\".\n\nHe once told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that it had played a major role in his life since childhood.\n\nThe star has already faced two other lawsuits this year.\n\nIn April, he was accused of racial discrimination and harassment by a former security guard at his now-closed school, the Donda Academy.\n\nBenjamin Deshon Provo claimed he had faced discrimination because he is Muslim and was ordered to cut his dreadlocks or be fired.\n\nWest has yet to respond to the allegations.\n\nIn February, the star was also sued by the estate of Donna Summer for using a sample of her song \"I Feel Love\" without permission. The case was later settled out of court.\n\nThe musician was one of the most successful and prolific rappers of the 2000s and 2010s, with multi-platinum hits like Gold Digger, Stronger and All Of The Lights.\n\nHowever, his recent career has been beset by controversies.\n\nMost notably, his lucrative contract with Adidas was terminated in November 2022 over antisemitic comments West made on social media.\n\nDespite that, the star returned to the top of the US charts earlier this year both with the hit single Carnival, and its parent album Vultures.", "source": {"uri": "tvcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVC News Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisciotta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racial discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_of_the_Lights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All of the Lights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zane Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donna Summer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace_Discrimination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace Discrimination", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tvcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/images-64.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

It's entirely his own doing, especially after his outspoken antisemitic rants horrified the world.\n\nIt's sadly no surprise to hear that someone who used to work for him is taking him to court.\n\nIn this case, the lawsuit accuses Kanye of wrongful termination, of sexual harassment, and of unpaid termination.\n\nAccording to court documents that Page Six obtained, Lauren Pisciotta is suing Kanye West.\n\nThe filings detail that she began working for him in July of 2021. At that time, he was preparing to launch his Yeezy fashion line.\n\nPisciotta is an influencer. As such, the legal documents explain, Kanye offered her $1 million (as an annual salary) to work as is assistant. She would need to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to do the job.\n\nIn her lawsuit, she shares that she was making another $1 million through her OnlyFans account at that time.\n\nHowever, in 2022, Kanye West allegedly insisted that she become more \"God like,\" by which he meant to delete her account. He allegedly offered to raise her salary to $2 million per year to compensate for the lost income. The lawsuit accuses him of not actually adjusting her income despite their agreement.\n\nThe bit about asking her to delete her OnlyFans is weird and controlling. It's also hypocritical given Kanye West's apparent porn studio aspirations.\n\nKanye's alleged failure to deliver the promised raise to Pisciotta is even more serious. That sort of thing can happen as an honest mistake, but any responsible employer should immediately work to rectify it with apologies.\n\nHowever, the filing says that Kanye began sending Lauren Pisciotta vulgar text messages. The sort of content that is inappropriate for an employer to send to an employee.\n\n\"See my problem is I be wanting to f-k but then after I f-k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f-ked while I'm f-king them. Then I want her to cheat on me,\" one of the inappropriate texts allegedly reads.\n\nThat is, at best, oversharing that is inappropriate for any workplace.\n\nHowever, in addition to burdening Pisciotta with explicit details of his sexual fantasies, he allegedly sent her photos and videos of his actual sexual activities with various women. (If this is true, it's possible that he did not have permission to share this media with others)\n\nAccording to Pisciotta, she received inappropriate photos of \"current and former\" Yeezy employees from Kanye West. And the incidents apparently went beyond what he sent to her.\n\nOther accusations include Ye allegedly masturbating while speaking to her on the phone, asking her about her sex life (including the penis sizes of her boyfriends), and forcing her \"to remove her cardigan while she was in the office because he said 'it was covering too much.'\"\n\nPerhaps the most alarming item in the lawsuit is the allegation that Kanye locked them in a room together and then masturbated beside her before he fell asleep. Pisciotta also reports in the lawsuit that he became angry when she declined to \"date or have sex\" with him.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Lauren Pisciotta received a promotion. She was Chief of Staff for several of Kanye West's companies, and would allegedly receive a $4 million salary. However, within a month, he fired her.\n\nPisciotta's lawsuit notes that she was offered a $3 million severance ... but never received it.

A former Yeezy employee named Lauren Pisciotta has sued Kanye, accusing him of sexual harassment. As per the lawsuit documents, Ye sent her disturbing text messages to Lauren, and he has also been accused of stalking her. Keep scrolling for the deets.\n\nYe is often embroiled in controversies due to his antisemitic views and erratic public behavior. He and his wife Bianca Censori even got banned in Venice for their NSFW activity on a public boat. He is accused of controlling his wife and making her wear exposing attire. Sources have reported Bianca's family's concern more than once to media outlets. PR experts once explained that his shenanigans are because he wants to stay relevant and in the news.\n\nAccording to Y! Entertainment, The Blast obtained documents where Kanye West has been accused of sexual harassment and wrongful termination by his former Yeezy assistant Lauren Pisciotta. As per reports, Lauren has worked in the music industry for about 15 years and has been in positions in Artist Management and Representation A&R, Marketing Consultant, and Project Management. The lawsuit reveals Lauren collaborated with Ye on the Yeezy Season I women's fashion line and placed three songs on 'Donda,' his 10th studio album, released in 2021. In that same year, Lauren was requested to serve as Executive Assistant/Personal Assistant in connection with the business affairs of all defendants and personal affairs. They agreed on a salary of $1,000,000 per year for Lauren.\n\nHowever, as per the documents, Lauren Pisciotta was required to be available 24/7 and accepted the offer.\n\nAs per the documents, Lauren had a solid social media presence, including her Instagram and an OnlyFans account. Ye was aware of that and did not have any problem with it. Lauren's social media generated around $1,000,000 annually. The lawsuit claimed that Kanye West boasted to his friends that Pisciotta was an OnlyFans Superstar.\n\nIt stated, \"[Her] social media presence included but was not limited to Instagram and OnlyFans and content of, among other things, professional bikini and lingerie photographs as a result of professional and tasteful photoshoots.\"\n\nIn 2022, Kanye West asked Lauren Pisciotta to delete her OnlyFans account, and as per the lawsuit, Ye claimed to pay her $1,000,000 annually if she agreed. Lauren gave up her OnlyFans account, but Ye allegedly never paid her. The lawsuit also claimed, \"[Kanye West] engaged in a systematic, severe and persuasive and offensive campaign of unlawful harassment based on [Ms. Pisciotta's] s*x, including sexual harassment, is in violation of various provisions of FEHA.\"\n\nApart from that, she also claimed that Ye masturb*ted in front of her and shared explicit s*xual details, pictures, texts and videos of s*x acts, \"including without limitation acts that [Ye] was engaged in and other pictures and videos of Instagram models, current and former YEEZY, LLC employees and various men and women.\" In 2022, Lauren Pisciotta was terminated and offered $3,000,000, but she claimed they never paid her. The document read, \"Defendants then reneged on their commitment to pay the severance to Plaintiff.\" She is suing Ye for at least $4,000,000 on account of breach of contract, sexual harassment, wrongful termination, and a hostile work environment.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Lauren Pisciotta also claimed that Kanye West sent her disturbing texts and as transcibed by TMZ one of the texts read, \"See my problem is I be wanting to f-ck but then after I f-ck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f-cked while I'm f-cking them. Then I want her to cheat on me ...\"\n\nAnother said, \"Is my d-ck racist? It is. This f-cking racist d-ck of mine. I going to beat this f-cking racist d-ck for being f-cking racist. I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black as-es and beat the sh-t out of my racist -ck ...

The latest suit against the disgraced rapper comes from his former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, who details a distressing pattern of sexual harassment over the course of the one year she worked on season one of his Yeezy women's fashion line and collaborated on his Donda album, from 2021 until 2022. (According to the BBC, Pisciotta does not have any formal credits on the record.) The court documents were reviewed by Rolling Stone.\n\nPisciotta says she met West in 2021, during which time he offered her a $1 million salary to be his \"Executive Assistant/Personal Assistant,\" on the condition that she be available to him \"24-7.\" At the time, Pisciotta claims she was making around $1 million annually on OnlyFans, which West was okay with at first. Eventually, however, he allegedly asked her to delete the account in exchange for $1 million, because he wanted her to be \"God like.\" This is when the alleged harassment started.\n\nAccording to the filing, West then began to send his employee a barrage of sexually explicit text messages and occasionally masturbated while discussing work-related matters on the phone with her. Per Rolling Stone, some of these graphic messages read as follows:\n\nPisciotta also claims that West was \"fixated on the penis size\" of her boyfriends and once sent a video of himself having sex with a model. She was also asked to deliver a sexual enhancement \"honey\" before his sexual encounters.\n\nIn a further escalation, Pisciotta alleges that once on an overnight flight to Paris with other Yeezy employees present, West locked the two of them in his room on the plane (the door could not be opened from the inside), where he proceeded to lie down on his bed and masturbate under the covers, while Pisciotta sat down in a chair across from him.\n\nPisciotta is also suing for a $3 million severance package which she says she never received after she was fired in 2022. Overall, the filing alleges sexual harassment, breach of contract, wrongful termination, fraud, unpaid wages, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThis is far from the first allegation leveled at West from his time at Yeezy, which was formally dropped by Adidas in 2022. In a lengthy New York Times report from 2023, former staffers detailed a decade of harassment, including West drawing swastikas on shoes and telling a Jewish staffer to \"hang a photo of Hitler in his kitchen and kiss it every day to practice unconditional love.\" In 2022, Rolling Stone also published a report alleging that West regularly played hardcore porn in meetings, and showed interviewees explicit content featuring his then-wife, Kim Kardashian.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Now, he's in huge trouble again, facing a lawsuit from his ex-assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, who is also an OnlyFans model. Pisciotta, who once served as West's personal and executive assistant, is taking legal action against him for alleged sexual harassment and wrongful termination. According to Radar Online, she claimed that after she started working for him, he bombarded her with a barrage of offensive texts and videos.\n\nOne of the purported texts read, \"See my problem is I be wanting to f** but then after I f* I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f*ed while I'm f**ing them. Then I want her to cheat on me...\" Meanwhile, another text read, \"Is my d** racist? It is. This f*ing racist d* of mine. I going to beat this f*ing racist d* for being f*ing racist. I'm going to stare at pictures of white women with black asses and beat the s* out of my racist d* ... Beating the s* out of his big black c**.\"\n\nAccording to TMZ, the situation took a turn for the worse with claims of increasingly explicit texts from West in which he detailed his sexual fantasies involving women. Pisciotta alleged that West approached her about a year into her job with an unusual proposition. He wanted her to embody a 'God Like' image and requested that she delete her OnlyFans account, offering to pay her $1 million annually if she agreed. Pisciotta said she accepted his offer.\n\nIn another shocking news, Pisciotta alleged that West engaged in highly inappropriate behavior, including masturbating during phone calls and asking her if she could guess what he was doing. She also claims that he later promoted her to Chief of Staff across his various businesses with a promised salary of $4 million. However, in October 2022, Pisciotta says she was abruptly fired. Despite being offered a $3 million severance package, she asserted that she never received the payment.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Pisciotta detailed multiple incidents with the Bound 2 singer, including him allegedly forcing her to remove her cardigan while she was in the office because he said 'it was covering too much.' In another instance, he allegedly locked them in a room together and masturbated next to her before falling asleep. She also claimed that he got angry after she shut down any advances to date or have sex with him, as reported by Page Six.\n\nThis latest lawsuit adds to his growing list of troubles, including a February lawsuit for using an uncleared sample on his latest album. Meanwhile, West has seen a rapid decline in his reputation. Adidas, the brand behind his famous Yeezy shoes, severed ties with him after his repeated antisemitic outbursts. Additionally, Donda Academy, a school he established in honor of his late mother, shut down amid accusations of mistreatment of staff, according to the Mirror.\n\nSEXUAL ASSAULT: If you are being subjected to sexual assault or know of anyone who is, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673).", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisciotta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Online", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar Online"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donda Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bound 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/697521/uploads/03457340-223c-11ef-9e32-ef069fd2641c_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

She is also suing the rapper and his various companies, including Yeezy, for fraud, unpaid wages and intentional infliction of emotional distress, according to Rolling Stone, which viewed the court documents.\n\nPisciotta reportedly collaborated with West on his Yeezy women's clothing line as well as on his 2021 album Donda. She said she was hired as his assistant in 2021, with a million-dollar annual salary, under the condition that she would be available to him \"24/7,\" Rolling Stone reports.\n\nPisciotta, who was already making the same annual income off OnlyFans and on social media, according to the lawsuit, said West was initially fine with her endeavor on the side. However, he then told her that he wanted her to be \"God like\" and asked her to delete her account, in exchange for an extra $1 million, the suit states. She complied. However, she claims West then began allegedly sexually harassing her.\n\nAccording to the suit, one of the texts from West to Pisciotta read, \"See my problem is I be wanting to fuck but then after I fuck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been fucked while I'm fucking them. Then I want her to cheat on me.\"\n\nIn another text, per the suit, he asked Pisciotta, \"Is my dick racist? I'm going to stare at pictures of white women with black asses and beat the shit out of my racist dick.\"\n\nPisciotta claims West was \"fixated on the penis size\" of her partners and that he would masturbate during phone conversations with her, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nAnd she alleges that during a flight to Paris, West informed her that he needed to talk to her and essentially trapped them in his room on the plane after he closed the door, which was unable to be opened from inside.

She also contends that a multimillion-dollar severance package was never paid.\n\nCourt papers containing Pisciotta's lawsuit against West were filed Monday, according to multiple news outlets.\n\nIn the complaint, Pisciotta alleges she had worked in the music industry for 15 years, collaborated with West on season one of his Yeezy women's fashion line, and contributed to three songs on his Donda album.\n\nThe plaintiff claims that West hired her as his \"executive assistant/personal assistant\" and offered her an annual salary of $1m on condition that she was available to him \"24/7\".\n\nPisciotta, a former OnlyFans model, says that she was making $1m annually from her account on the platform.

Meanwhile, Adidas continues to market a billion dollars worth of West's Yeezy-designed stock - but without the brand name.\n\nBefore Pisciotta's lawsuit, West had referred to a \"full-on pornography addiction\" that \"destroyed my family\" and had previously been accused of lewd behaviour, too.\n\nLast year, former employees of his Yeezy fashion line told Rolling Stone he played pornographic films during staff meetings and showed an intimate photograph of Kim Kardashian, his former wife.\n\nRepresentatives of West have not responded to Pisciotta's lawsuit, according to reports.

The former employee is accusing the Donda founder of masturbating in her presence.\n\nAccording to legal documents, Pisciotta was already making \"seven figures\" on OnlyFans when she was asked to work with Ye in 2021. She claims West offered her $1,000,000 to drop her adult-content job and become his \"God like\" executive/personal assistant. Pisciotta said that the job description consisted of being on-call for the Chicagoan 24/7.\n\nThe woman says that when she began working for Yeezy, he started to behave inappropriately, including sending her explicit text messages and pleasuring himself. Pisciotta claims that he sent her one message that read: \"See my problem is I be wanting to f**k but then after I f**k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f**ked while I'm f**king them. Then I want her to cheat on me.\"\n\nIn another message, she alleges that the ex-husband of Kim Kardashian wrote: \"Is my d*ck racist? I'm going to stare at pictures of white women with black a**es and beat the sh*t out of my racist d*ck.\"\n\nAdditionally, the former assistant says West was \"fixated\" on knowing the size of her boyfriend's penis and would unsolicitedly send her footage of him sexually engaging with models.\n\nPisciotta recalled two times witnessing the 46-year-old pleasuring himself - once while on the phone with her, and another time when he allegedly locked himself in a room with her during a private flight to Paris. She says the Grammy-winner then laid down on a bed and masturbated under covers until he fell asleep.\n\nAccording to Pisciotta, Ye let her go in October 2022 after she allegedly turned down a $4,000,000 offer to be his Chief of Staff.\n\nThe adult-content creator is now suing West for wrongful termination and breach of contract.

However, she states that she was terminated in October 2022. Although she claims to have accepted a $3 million severance package, she asserts that she has not yet received it.\n\nREAD ALSO: UAE: Sharjah set to build new stadiums on mounttains for Kalba and Khorfakkan", "source": {"uri": "me.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable ME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_work_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostile work environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharjah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_package", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severance package"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_me/photo/default/kanye-west_yc5x.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 286, "textEnd": 294}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

On this occasion, a former assistant who alleges sexual harassment, breach of contract, unjustified dismissal and hostile work environment, reported the TMZ portal, notes EFE.\n\nLauren Pisciotta worked as the artist's personal assistant between July 2021 and October 2022, when she was fired. According to the model, West kicked her out after sending her text messages and sexual videos.\n\nTMZ highlighted that Pisciotta was an OnlyFans model who posted photos in bikini and lingerie. Her success with them led her to earn a million dollars a year.\n\nWest met her at a time when he had launched his clothing line and hired her, according to the portal. The outlet cites the legal document, in which Pisciotta also alleges that she worked with the rapper on three songs from his album 'Donda'.\n\nPisciotta points out that in July 2022 West asked her to delete her OnlyFans account, promising that he would pay her one million dollars a year, the same amount she earned from her lingerie photos, and she accepted.\n\nShortly after, she claims, the artist began sending her racy text messages, masturbating when they talked on the phone and asking her if she could hear or guess what he was doing, according to TMZ.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit echoed by that website, there were a large number of text messages, sexual photographs and videos, including two in which the rapper had sexual relations with a model.\n\nWest then appointed Pisciotta as chief of staff for his various companies, with a salary of $2022 million, but in October XNUMX he fired her.\n\nWest offered her compensation of three million dollars, which she accepted and which he never paid.\n\nOn April 2, another former employee of West sued him, as well as his Yeezy clothing brand, and Donda, the private school he owns, for racial discrimination, harassment and wrongful termination, among others.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by Trevor Phillips, an African-American who claims he suffered abuse from the singer since he began working with him in 2022 for his Yeezy brand.\n\nIn April 2023, West was also sued for racial discrimination by two former African-American teachers who claimed they were unfairly fired.

A former assistant has sued him for sexual harassment, breach of contract and wrongful termination. According to 'Page Six', Lauren Pisciotta, who has served the singer for two years, has alleged that the star sent her lewd texts and performed sex acts while on the phone with her. She also said that the rapper fired her in 2022, but did not pay the $3 million severance package that was agreed upon.

She said in the lawsuit that West hired her to work on the first season of his Yeezy women's fashion line. But they worked together on three tracks from his Donda album, though Pisciotta did not have any formal credits on the record. The rapper later hired her as his assistant, with an annual salary of $1 million.\n\nPisciotta has also said that initially the Donda singer had no problem with her OnlyFans business, but later asked her to delete it, be 'God-like' and offered her $1 million in exchange. She has alleged in the lawsuit that after she deleted it, Kanye West sent her numerous explicit texts and pornographic videos. Kanye West has not responded to these allegations, he has maintained silence.\n\nThe rapper is already facing two other lawsuits.

In the lawsuit, Benjamin Deshon Provo claimed to be discriminated against for being a Muslim and was asked to cut his dreadlocks or be fired.\n\nThe estate of Donna Summer sued the rapper in February for using a sample of her song \"I Feel Love\" without permission.

Most notably, his lucrative contract with Adidas was terminated in November 2022 over antisemitic comments West made on social media.\n\nDespite that, the star returned to the top of the US charts earlier this year both with the hit single Carnival, and its parent album Vultures.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_of_the_Lights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All of the Lights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zane Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donna Summer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace_Discrimination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace Discrimination", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/8c179c311706edae8456aafd5807cd95", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

During this time, she had also continued her OnlyFans work, per the complaint.\n\nAfter a year working as his assistant, she claimed that the \"Carnival\" musician told her that he wanted her to be \"God like\" and asked her to delete her OnlyFans account, promising to pay her an additional $1 million to make up for her loss in income if she did so, to which she agreed, she claims in the complaint.\n\nHowever, soon after Pisciotta closed out her account, she alleged that West began sending her lewd messages, in which he explicitly detailed sexual acts that he wanted to engage in, along with pornographic photos and videos.\n\nShe also alleged that West would masturbate while he had phone conversations with her, would ask her questions about her boyfriends' penis sizes, and in one instance asked her to remove her cardigan in the office because it \"was covering too much.\" In one other incident she detailed in the complaint, she claimed that the rapper trapped her in a private room on his plane and pleasured himself in front of her.\n\nPisciotta said she was eventually promoted to Chief of Staff of his various companies in September 2022, which came with a $4 million salary, but added that he fired her a month later. She said she was offered $3 million in severance pay, but never received it.\n\nPisciotta is also suing West and his Yeezy businesses for fraud, unpaid wages and intentional infliction of emotional distress, according to the complaint.\n\nWest's representatives did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThis isn't the first time that the rapper has faced pornography allegations by his workers. Former Yeezy staffers previously alleged that he played pornographic films during staff meetings, discussed porn and even showed an intimate photograph of then-wife Kim Kardashian during job interviews, according to a November 2022 article by Rolling Stone.\n\nWest also faces a separate lawsuit filed in April 2024 from one of his former employees who claimed that he suffered \"severe discrimination, harassment\" while working for the star's Yeezy brand and at his Donda Academy school.\n\nHe has not responded to either of the other allegations.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_work_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostile work environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carnival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intentional infliction of emotional distress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/bUqzzHj0r-vh_e3Hh4BJrJf63es=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(716x267:718x269)/Kanye-West-performs-onstage-at-the-Power-106-powerhouse-show-060424-c4878a8ce19449b8bd0513f1f5c68549.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

However, the following month, she claimed that she was fired and offered a $3m severance package, which she did not receive.\n\nShe is suing West for sexual harassment, breach of contract and wrongful termination, and is also suing West and his affiliated Yeezy companies for fraud, unpaid wages, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThe Independent has contacted West's representative for comment.\n\nIn 2022, the Vultures rapper was accused of sharing an explicit image of his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, with Adidas employees during a job interview while he was still married to the reality TV star.\n\nAn investigation by Rolling Stone also reported that Ye allegedly showed an explicit video of Kardashian, as well as sex tapes he made of himself with other women, to several Adidas co-workers.\n\nThe claims were made in an open letter by \"prominent former members of the Yeezy team\", which also alleged that Adidas bosses were aware of the musician's \"problematic behaviour\" but failed to intervene because they had \"turned their moral compass off\".\n\nA spokesperson for Adidas said at the time: \"Adidas does not tolerate hate speech and offensive behaviour and therefore has terminated the Adidas Yeezy partnership.\n\n\"We have been and continue to be actively engaged in conversations with our employees about the events that lead [sic] to our decision to end the partnership. They have our full support and as we're working through the details of the termination, we have been clear that we want to keep our employees' talent and skills within the organisation.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roisin_o_connor@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Roisin O'Connor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas_Yeezy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas Yeezy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intentional infliction of emotional distress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2fbb305a5caba8f2f3d7a5d2c41b0125", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Plaintiff was unable to leave as the door had locked and jammed behind her.\"\n\nA rep for West, who now legally goes by the name Ye, did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, West hired Pisciotta in July 2021 after they met while she was working in connection with his fashion line. She says she agreed to work for him as a \"full time employee\" in return for a $1 million salary.\n\nAt the time she was hired, Pisciotta says she maintained a successful page on OnlyFans - a social media site in which subscribers can pay to access sexually explicit content from individual creators. Pisciotta says the page was generating more than $1 million per year, and West \"did not have any issue or objection to it\" when she was hired.\n\nBut a year later, she says West told her that he wanted her to be \"God like\" and asked her to delete the page in return for a promise of a $1 million payment. Though she agreed to do so, her lawyers claim she didn't see any of that money: \"Ye never paid plaintiff as promised.\"\n\nPisciotta's lawsuit came with pages of texts allegedly sent by West, many of them sexually graphic. In one, he allegedly sent a video of him having sex and then asked \"What u think of this vid.\" In another, he referenced an earlier outing at a bowling alley: \"I just thinking back to the bowling alley thinking of what the headline could have been,\" the rapper wrote in one of the alleged texts. \"Ye arrested for fucking the shit out of his assistant on the bowling alley floor.\"\n\nIn another incident, the lawsuit says West told a male guest that he could have sex with Pisciotta in exchange for allowing West to have sex with another woman.\n\nIn October 2022, Pisciotta says she was terminated, shortly after she had been promoted to chief of staff and offered a huge raise. Though she was allegedly offered a $3 million severance payment, she claims West and his companies later \"reneged on their commitment to pay the severance.\"\n\nIn technical terms, the lawsuit includes claims of breach of contract, wrongful termination, sexual harassment, retaliation, gender discrimination, fraud and various other employment law violations.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_donahue@billboard.com", "name": "Bill Donahue", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisciotta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live Nation Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_alley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling alley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kanye-west-yeezy-2015-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

According to TMZ, Pisciotta claims that Kanye fired her after sending inappropriate sexual texts and videos. She is suing for breach of contract, sexual harassment, and hostile work environment. Kanye hired Lauren in July 2021 after meeting her while working on his fashion line, Yeezy. She states that she collaborated with him and contributed to three songs on Donda.\n\nA year later, she says he expressed a desire for her to be 'God-like'. Allegedly, he requested her to delete her OnlyFans account, promising to pay her $1 million annually if she complied.\n\nAccording to the report, Lauren alleges that Kanye engaged in disturbing behavior during their phone conversations, including masturbating and asking if she could hear or guess what he was doing. She also claims he had an obsession with the penis sizes of her boyfriends.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the situation escalated with more explicit texts allegedly sent by Kanye, detailing his sexual fantasies involving women with explicit language. One of them read, \"Is my d*** racist? It is. This f***ing racist d*** of mine. I going to beat this f***ing racist d*** for being f***ing racist. I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black asses and beat the s*** out of my racist d*** ... Beating the s*** out of his big black c***.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Kanye sent Lauren sexual videos and photos, including footage of him engaging in sexual activity with a model. Despite these allegations, Lauren stated that she was promoted to the position of chief of staff for Kanye's various companies and was earning a salary of $4 million.

She also worked on some clothing lines for his Yeezy clothing brand.\n\nIn 2021, the year West released Donda, he asked her to become his \"Executive Assistant/Personal Assistant\" on an annual salary of $1 million. She duly agreed to the terms, which stated that she had to be available \"24-7\".\n\nAccording to a new report obtained by Rolling Stone, Pisciotta claims that she was already making $1 million per annum through her OnlyFans account and social media endeavours. West initially had no issues with her OnlyFans dealings. However, he later allegedly asked her to be \"God-like\" and delete her account in exchange for $1 million. After this, West began to make advances via text message.\n\nIn one of the text messages, the rapper allegedly wrote, \"See my problem is I be wanting to fuck but then after I fuck I want a girl to tell me how hard they been fucked while I'm fucking them.\" Adding, \"Then I want her to cheat on me.\"\n\nPisciotta also alleged that West often \"fixated on the penis size\" of her past lovers. \"Is my dick racist?\" she claims he wrote in another explicit message. \"I'm going to stare at pictures of white women with black asses and beat the shit out of my racist dick.\" West also allegedly sent Piscotta pornographic videos and images featuring himself and an unnamed model.\n\nIn perhaps the most concerning part of the report, West allegedly trapped Piscotta in his private room during a flight to Paris with several other Yeezy employees. He then reportedly got her to sit opposite him while he lay down and masturbated under the covers. Eventually, he fell asleep, and Piscotta left the room.\n\nAlongside the sexual harassment claim, Piscotta is suing the 'Stronger' rapper for breach of contract. According to the suit, she was promoted to Chief of Staff for West's various business endeavours and informed that she would receive a $3 million bonus. However, a month later, Piscotta claims that she was sacked and offered $3 million in severance, which she apparently still hasn't received.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_potter@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Jordan Potter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breach of contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis_size", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human penis size"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stronger_(Kanye_West_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stronger (Kanye West song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/04/Kanye-West-2024-Ye-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

She also revealed that she co-wrote three songs for the rapper's album Donda, which was released in 2021.\n\n35-year-old Lauren Pisciotta was born on August 18, 1988. She is 5ft 9in tall. Lauren has a younger sibling named Taylor.\n\nLauren is an American social media celebrity, fitness model, and artist manager.

She also mentioned she was sent pictures and videos showing West engaging in s*xual activity.\n\nIn April 2023, West was confronted with numerous lawsuits about the Donda Academy. Numerous educators reported that numerous health and safety infractions at the school had gone unnoticed. The lawyer for the rapper refuted the accusations and requested the judge to dismiss the case. The lawyer said, \"None of it is true and the allegations do a disservice to the Donda Academy's current staff and students and their parents who will attest to their positive experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vanshika_sharma@thesportsgrail.com", "name": "Vanshika Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisciotta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pisciotta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niykee_Heaton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niykee Heaton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheerleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donda Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/WHAT-HAS-KANYE-WEST-SAID-ABOUT-ILLUMINATI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622115", "eventUri": "eng-9622115", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 413, "textEnd": 419}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-08-", "textStart": 661, "textEnd": 670}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

This Is SICK! - Perez Hilton", "body": "Another week, another lawsuit filed against Kanye West.\n\nThis time the plaintiff is his ex-assistant Lauren Pisciotta, who is taking him to court for sexual harassment, creating a hostile work environment, breach of contract, and wrongful termination. And even before any alleged breach, their contract and the story behind it is sketchy as hell.\n\nOK, so per the lawsuit, first reported by TMZ, Lauren explains how she was a successful OnlyFans model. So successful, in fact, she claims she was making $1 million a year! Wow!\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by LP\u2728 (@laurenpisciotta)\n\nIn July 2021, Ye hired her to help him out with his Yeezy fashion line. She says she helped on three Donda tracks, too, though we don't know in what way. Look, we can't say why he hired her -- but we would be blind not to notice she very much fits some physical qualifications... We mean, she looks SO MUCH like Bianca Censori she could be her sister. Not to mention a few others Ye dated after Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe man clearly has a type. And hiring an OnlyFans model who's your exact type to be your \"assistant\"? Yeah, sorry, that's already a little sketchy to us. But it was a good deal for her, a side hustle for her OF career, making connections in show business, that kind of thing. So she took it.\n\nRelated: Bianca Censori's Family Think Ye Has Been 'Using Her' To Promote Porn All This Time!\n\nHowever, she says, a year into working with Kanye, the rapper told her he wanted her to be more \"God like\" and shut down her OnlyFans account. Sound familiar? Like when he told Kim to stop dressing so sexy? KIM KARDASHIAN, whom he'd featured nude in a music video??\n\nHow dare he, right? Where does he get the right? Well, he tried to buy the right, allegedly telling Lauren he would pay her the million bucks per year she'd be losing out on. RED FLAG! We mean, that is some controlling, patriarchal, not-at-all-professional s**t right there. But Lauren agreed to it.\n\nNow that he had her complete attention, Kanye allegedly used it to sexually harass Lauren. She included many explicit texts in her filing, claiming Ye sent her extremely intimate messages like:\n\n\"See my problem is I be wanting to f**k but then after I f**k I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f**ked while I'm f**king them. Then I want her to cheat on me...\"\n\nYeesh. Not a conversation to have with an employee! In another he even talks about masturbation, saying:\n\n\"Is my d**k racist? It is. This f**king racist d**k of mine. I going to beat this f**king racist d**k for being f**king racist. I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black asses and beat the s**t out of my racist d**k ... Beating the s**t out of his big black c**k.\"\n\nWow. So \"God like\"!\n\nLauren says he also full-on masturbated while on the phone with her -- pointing it out to her by making her guess what he was doing. She says he also became obsessed with asking about her boyfriend's penis size. She says he sent many sexual videos as well, including at least two which showed him having sex with another woman.\n\nAgain, these are the texts of a terrible, controlling ex-boyfriend -- NOT AN EMPLOYER!\n\nBut that's what Kanye was to her. In fact, she says, he soon promoted her to his Chief of Staff. LOLz! Remember when Ye was supposedly running for president? This isn't that, it's just a made-up position. But it's a made-up position for which she was now promised $4 million!\n\nInstead, just a few months later, in October 2022 she was fired. She says Ye promised her a $3 million severance, which she agreed to. But he never paid that either!\n\nIt's not yet clear how much Lauren is asking for, but we're guessing it's the millions he owes her and THEN SOME! And with the evidence she reportedly has, we can't imagine she'll have too much trouble getting it.\n\nWhat do YOU think of this latest lawsuit, Perezcious paralegals?

She's suing for breach of contract, sexual harassment, and hostile work environment.

She reportedly also claims he was fixated on the penis size of her boyfriends.\n\nKanye reportedly hired Lauren in July 2021 after meeting her when he was putting together his fashion line, Yeezy. She says she also collaborated with him and worked with him on three songs on Donda. A year later, she says he told her he wanted her to be 'God-like'. He asked her to delete her OnlyFans account and she reportedly agreed as he promised to pay her $1 million a year if she did so.\n\nShe claims, shortly thereafter, Kanye began to send her a series of text messages, including one, shared by TMZ, that read, \"See my problem is I be wanting to f*** but then after I f*** I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f***ed while I'm f***ing them. Then I want her to cheat on me ...\"\n\nTMZ reported that 'it gets really vulgar after that - with more alleged texts sent from Lauren that describe Kanye's sexual fantasies with women, including a lot of explicit language'.

I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with black asses and beat the s*** out of my racist d*** ... Beating the s*** out of his big black c***.\"\n\nMoreover, according to the lawsuit, there were sexual videos and photos that were sent to Lauren, including at least two videos of Kanye having sex with a model.\n\nWhile dealing with Kanye's alleged behaviour, Lauren said she was promoted to chief of staff for his various companies and was earning a $4 million salary.

She's seeking coverage of all legal fees, compensatory and punitive damages, penalties to be applied under relevant labor laws and any other damages the court may deem appropriate.\n\nIt's the third lawsuit the rapper has faced this year.

bombarded her with explicit messages, sexual videos and photos.\n\nLauren Pisciotta also alleges the 'Heartless' singer masturbated and performed sex acts while on the phone with her, according to US media.\n\nShe also said, on one occasion, he locked her in a room on his private plane and masturbated in front of her.\n\nShe also claims the rapper was fixated on the penis size of her former boyfriends.\n\nWest is yet to respond to any of the allegations made against him.\n\nAccording to court documents, Pisciotta was hired in July 2021 when she ran a successful OnlyFans profile and they collaborated together on three songs on his album Donda, according to TMZ.\n\nShe described how a year later West asked her to stop using OnlyFans, offering her a yearly salary of $1million (\u00a3780,000) if she agreed, which she did.\n\nPisciotta was later promoted to Chief of Staff for his various companies and her salary increased to $4m (\u00a33.14m).\n\nIn October 2022, Pisciotta claims she was fired and offered a $3m (\u00a32.35m) severance package, which she accepted but alleges never recieved.\n\nShe's suing for breach of contract, sexual harassment, wrongful termination

public outings have prompted concern among Censori's friends and family, with some reportedly concerned that she is being 'controlled'.\n\nSources close to Censori - an Australian architect - have suggested the rapper, who legally changed his name to Ye, allegedly chooses what food she eats and what clothes she is allowed to wear.\n\nWest has also faced public backlash for rants, including

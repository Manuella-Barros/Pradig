on this island or whether it is in the government in London\".\n\nHe said it was important to stand united against racism.\n\n\"We will not be led into the gutter by far right activists whether they

Current deputy mayor Jason Barr and Shauna Cusack, who both put themselves forward for the post, resigned over the \"undemocratic\" manner of the selection.\n\nSpeaking on BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Ms Seenoi-Barr said despite the abuse and death threats, the majority of people in Derry stood with her.\n\n\"It is an honour to be considered mayor and be selected, it is a lifetime opportunity,\" she said.\n\n\"It was obviously a disappointment that two of my colleagues who I have worked with the last three years decided to resign, but I'm focused on the way forward.\n\n\"I was elected by the people of Derry who have really taken me into their hearts and been kind to me and I want to be able to serve them properly.\n\n\"It's not about making history, but it is about delivering for the people and representing the people that elected me.\"\n\nShe said her selection was an \"open process... a robust interview, very competitive\".\n\nShe added: \"I was very prepared for the interview, I work very hard for my community.\"\n\nThe SDLP conceded communication with its representatives was poor and said is will change how it appoints civil leadership positions in the future.\n\nThe party is expected to propose an amendment at its next annual general meeting to \"regularise the process\".\n\nMs Seenoi-Barr has received hundreds of messages of congratulations, including from party leader Colum Eastwood and First Minister Michelle O'Neill.\n\nHer selection was also widely reported in Kenya.\n\nSenator Ledama Olekina posted on X: \"Please join me in congratulating my baby sister Councillor Lilian Seenoi for being elected as the first black Maasai Mayor of the City of Derry.\"\n\nIn response to the abuse she has received, Ms Seenoi-Barr said: \"Since I put myself forward to represent my community, since I came to this country, I've been experiencing racism.\n\n\"But obviously it's beyond what I had been experiencing.\n\n\"The death threats have been extremely hurtful to my family and to myself too.\n\n\"But I'm more focused on the positives, I have had enormous support across the island.\"\n\nShe joined the SDLP team on Derry City and Strabane District Council in June 2021 after being co-opted in the Foyleside ward.\n\nShe retained her seat in last year's council local elections.\n\nCondemning the racist abuse, Mr Eastwood said: \"We will not be led into the gutter by far-right activists, whether they are coming from America, Dublin or Derry online.\"", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

aimed at Northern Ireland's first black mayor | The Irish Post", "body": "Lilian Seenoi-Barr is set to become the first black mayor in Northern Ireland (Image: SDLP)\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood has condemned a 'deluge of abuse' aimed at incoming Mayor of Derry, Lilian Seenoi-Barr.\n\nThe SDLP councillor for Foyleside was recently selected by the party to serve as the next Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council.\n\nWhen she succeeds Sinn F\u00e9in's Patricia Logue on June 3, Ms Seenoi-Barr will become Northern Ireland's first black mayor.\n\nHowever, speaking at Stormont on Friday, Mr Eastwood revealed the incoming mayor had been subjected to abuse from around the world since her selection was announced.\n\nThe MP for Foyle also condemned far-right activists targeting Taoiseach Simon Harris' home as he urged politicians to be careful with their language.\n\n\"We saw last night that there were far-right protestors outside the Taoiseach's own family home, which is utterly disgraceful,\" said Mr Eastwood.\n\n\"We've also seen this week the new first ever black mayor of Derry facing an enormous deluge of abuse from around the world, right up to and including very serious death threats.\n\n\"This kind of stuff is allowed to happen because politicians don't mind their language and I think all of us have to be very careful about that, whether it's on this island or whether it's in the government in London.\n\n\"It's important that all of us stand against that level of racism and show that this is a different kind of place and we will not be led into the gutter by far-right activists -- whether they're coming from America, Dublin or Derry -- online.\"\n\nThe process behind Ms Seenoi-Barr's selection has been criticised by some SDLP councillors, with the party not holding a membership ballot to choose the next mayor.\n\nCouncillors Shauna Cusack and current Deputy Mayor Jason Barr, who were both in the running for the role, resigned from the party this week over the selection process.\n\nHowever, both have stressed their grievance was with SDLP management and have offered their support to Ms Seenoi-Barr.\n\n\"Please know it's business as usual, only difference is it's me myself and I,\" said Mr Barr, who will continue as an independent councillor for Sperrin.\n\n\"Can I finally add that I wish Lilian a very successful tenure in her position of Mayoress for our council area, a position I have no doubt in saying, she will go above and beyond.\"\n\nMs Cusack, who will likewise continue as an independent councillor for Foyleside, condemned the racist abuse directed at Ms Seenoi-Barr.\n\n\"Finally, I would like to please implore those blaming the person not the process, to welcome Lilian as your new Mayor,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"To reject and condemn any ugly, racist or hurtful language, this is not what Derry people are and it's certainly not showing solidarity.\n\n\"I'm sure Cllr Lilian Barr will make the role her own and work for everyone with the energy and ambition she is renowned for.\n\n\"I wish her and the Party the very best going forward.\"\n\nIn a statement to members, the party defended the selection process, which required all candidates to be interviewed.\n\nIt admitted there may have been failures in communication over the process but added that appointments have previously been made without balloting members, citing the nomination of Mr Barr himself as Deputy Mayor in 2023.\n\nSpeaking about her appointment, Ms Seenoi-Barr, who is originally from Kenya, said she is proud to call Derry her home.\n\n\"The people of this city have taken me into their hearts and everywhere I go I never fail to be amazed at the warmth, kindness and generosity of the people who live here,\" she said.\n\n\"Having initially come to Derry as a refugee facing an uncertain future, I can now truly say that my family have found their home.\n\n\"I am proud to be a Maasai woman and a Derry girl.\"\n\nMs Seenoi-Barr was co-opted as an SDLP councillor for Foyleside in 2021 and retained her seat in the 2023 election.", "source": {"uri": "irishpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

I had a really, really good childhood. I played a lot with my siblings and my cousins. I went to a village primary school until primary four.\n\n\"When I left primary four, I went to Narok town to be with my mum. My first four years were spent with my auntie.\n\n\"My mother was a businesswoman. She ran a big supermarket in Narok, so she was quite busy, and my aunt brought us up in our early years.\"\n\nFollowing high school, she attended university in Kenya, where she studied women's reproductive health.\n\n\"I really wanted to understand women's issues. I wanted to understand the biology of a woman's body.\n\n\"I also studied community development because I knew community development was key engaging with our community, to try and change the perspective on women's issues.\n\n\"I was always focused on empowering the Maasai child, amplifying their voice and giving them the choice I was given by my parents, which enabled me to make good decisions.\n\n\"I was inspired by my parents' ways of bringing up their children and I wanted to instil those values in the Maasai community and the Maasai people - that is why I focused on those women's empowerment programmes I was running in Kenya.\"\n\nOn reflection, she realised her parents had moved their family from Ol Ombokishi to Narok specifically to protect them from certain Maasai traditions.\n\nShe explained: \"When you are young and you are in the village, as a result of peer pressure, you might be influenced into things like early marriage or female genital mutilation.\n\n\"My parents really wanted us to be independent minded. They wanted us to focus on our own education and to grow up in an environment where we were enabled to make our own decisions and to have that voice.\"\n\nMs Seenoi-Barr's decision to leave Kenya was heavily influenced by the fact she was a mum of a young boy, Brian, who had autism.\n\nShe added: \"It was a very dangerous job I was doing back home. The rescuing of girls was quite intimidating and quite dangerous.\n\n\"When I was doing it by myself, I didn't care much about the implications but when I had my son, there were threats made towards both of us and, as a mum, I had to think twice about what was most important. Was it to continue the work or to protect my child, who really required my protection?\n\n\"At that time in Kenya, although things are changing now, any people with disabilities were regarded as a bad omen by the community.\n\n\"In terms of the work I was doing, there were people who did not welcome progress and they used my son's autism as a weapon to try and excite people towards me. So, I had to leave. I came to Northern Ireland in 2010 as a refugee at the age of 28,\" said Ms Seenoi-Barr, who subsequently met and married her husband Patrick.\n\nWhen she first came to Derry, she said she had not been planning to stay.\n\n\"I was planning to have a small holiday but unfortunately things just turned really bad back home,\" she said.\n\n\"Luckily I knew people in Derry before I came here. I had met a group of volunteers from Derry and Donegal who had travelled to Kenya. They were members of Seeds and the Changaro Trust. They built schools for the Maasai community.\n\n\"Changaro Trust invited me to Derry. Meanwhile the threats were ongoing, and I was getting a lot of hostile calls. Changaro decided to host me here.\n\n\"They were telling me I couldn't go back and they helped me to bring my son here. We then looked for refugee status and I was successful, actually within a very short time because the threats I was facing were very clear.\"\n\nShe highlighted that many of today's refugees have had the same experiences.\n\nShe added: \"They are going through a very hard time back in their countries but just because they cannot prove it as I did, they are staying in the system for a very long time.\"\n\nOnce she got her refugee status, she described Derry as 'becoming her home'.\n\n\"I made my home here and obviously I had a lot of challenges trying to settle with my son, but the people of Derry really stood up for me,\" she said.\n\n\"I remember, the first woman I ever met was Brenda Stevenson. At that time, she was an SDLP councillor, and she was also a speech therapist. Brenda really helped me get a school for my son.\n\n\"I was so inspired by the way people in Derry stood up for others. One of the things I know about Derry people is they just can't let anyone suffer. I was really supported.\n\n\"I then met another lady called Kathleen Bradley who helped me enormously. She worked for Dove House at that time. She helped me get a house and really supported me.\"\n\nMs Seenoi-Barr, who will become Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council at June's annual general meeting, said she was delighted South Belfast MP Claire Hanna had clarified the SDLP's mayoral selection process.\n\nShe added: \"I put my name forward when we were asked to express our intentions, because this year was the party's year to have a mayor. I engaged with that open process, and I was selected after very robust interview.\"\n\nFollowing her announcement as mayor-designate, two fellow councillors who had been in contention described the process as \"undemocratic\".\n\n\"Since the announcement was made, I have been deeply humbled by the warmth and kindness of people in Derry,\" she added.\n\n\"The racist abuse to which I have been subjected does not represent the people of Derry and I am not focusing on it.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

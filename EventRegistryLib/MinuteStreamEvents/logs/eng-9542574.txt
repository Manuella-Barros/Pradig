But the Duke of Sussex's spokesperson said Prince Harry hopes to see his father soon.\n\nThe Duke's spokesperson confirmed Harry would not be meeting with King Charles as he travels over the pond from the US. Harry arrived in London earlier today, May 7, as part of the 10th anniversary event for the Invictus Games, reports MirrorOnline.\n\nThe service will be held tomorrow at St Paul's Cathedral in the English capital. The annual games was set-up by Harry so injured servicemen and women could compete in sports.\n\nREAD MORE: Motorists warned overloading car with belongings could result in \u00a31,000 fine\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp, click the link to join\n\nIt was thought Harry might visit with King Charles during his visit to Britain but this now seems like it is not possible. A spokesperson for the Duke said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty''s full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry arrived in the capital today, travelling without his wife Meghan Markle or their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. It is believed he is undertaking several Invictus Games commitments this afternoon and has been seen visiting Armoury House in East London, where he took part in a panel discussion hosted by former BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin at a one-day summit, called the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation.\n\nIt is less than a mile from where Queen Camilla is carrying out an engagement at a primary school, where she is unveiling a Coronation Library. Earlier today the King was also seen leaving Windsor Castle to head to London, where he has been holding audiences this afternoon at Buckingham Palace. Tomorrow, he is expected to be at a Buckingham Palace garden party - just days after his return to public duties amid his cancer treatment.\n\nHarry has had a frosty relationship with his dad, especially since he was highly critical of his royal relatives in his controversial memoir Spare - and and was particularly scathing about his stepmother Camilla. But according to sources, the monarch had been keen to see his son, who now lives in California.\n\nA source said last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's trip to the UK is his second to Britain this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his ailing father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House. It marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.\n\nA reunion with his estranged older brother Prince William also does not seem to be on the cards either. An insider said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry will meet up with Meghan later in the week when the pair embark on a tour of Nigeria, where they are expected to meet with military staff. The service at St Paul's is scheduled two days after Harry's son Prince Archie celebrates his fifth birthday.\n\nActor Damian Lewis is set to recite the Invictus poem during the service. Representatives from Invictus Games participating nations, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community, will also be in attendance.", "source": {"uri":

He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\" Royal sources insisted that despite having a busy diary next week, Charles intends to see his estranged son.\n\nHarry looks set to stay in the UK for three days. It will be his second time in Britain this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his ailing father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House.\n\nHarry is not expected to see his older brother Prince William\n\nIt marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US. Charles, who returned to public duties last week, is expected to be in London on Tuesday for cancer treatment.\n\nAides said his movements are dependent on how he is feeling on any day. Harry's contact with his dad has \"remained positive\", a source revealed. The Duke has sent messages of support during his cancer battle. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.\n\nHowever, despite potentially seeing his father, a reunion with his estranged older brother Prince William does not seem to be on the cards. An insider said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nThe service at St Paul's is scheduled two days after Harry's son Prince Archie celebrates his fifth birthday. Actor Damian Lewis is set to recite the Invictus poem during the service. Representatives from Invictus Games participating nations, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community, will also be in attendance.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lewis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32101029.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mirror-Group-Newspapers-phone-hacking-trial-High-Court-London-UK-06-Jun-2023.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nYet, it seems the timing isn't quite right for a reunion between the once-close siblings as a source said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time\".\n\nThe brothers have seen each other only a few times since Harry stepped back from royal duties and relocated to the US.\n\nA notable occasion was their grandfather Prince Philip's funeral in 2021, shortly after Meghan and Harry's explosive Oprah interview that shook the public's view of their royal relations and led Harry to suggest that his father and brother were \"trapped\" in the monarchy.\n\nIn his memoir, Harry disclosed that post-funeral, he and William had a heated exchange, during which Charles implored them not to make his \"final years a misery\".\n\nThe duke wrote that William, who has alternated between being his \"beloved brother\" and \"arch nemesis\", couldn't fathom why Harry chose to leave the UK.\n\nThe brothers reunited once more when they revealed a statue in honour of their mother Diana in July 2021, on what would have been her 60th birthday, and then again to commemorate the late Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022.\n\nA few months later, the brothers were drawn together again in shared sorrow as they mourned their late grandmother together, even managing to share a light-hearted moment amidst the sadness.\n\nAs they readied themselves to trail their grandmother's coffin through London's streets, both brothers were reminded of the time they had done the same for their mother when they were just children.\n\nHarry recounted in an ITV interview a few weeks later: \"Just recently my brother and I were walking the same route, and we sort of joked to each other and said, 'At least we know the way'.\n\n\"It was very similar. The only difference was the levels of emotion. Because our grandmother had finished life.\n\n\"There was more, I think, of a celebration and respect and recognition to what she had accomplished. Whereas our mother was taken away far too young.\"\n\nHarry is currently in the UK to attend a special service at St. Paul's Cathedral marking 10 years of the Invictus Games - a sports competition for wounded ex-servicepeople that Harry established in 2014.\n\nThe duke is making the journey alone, with Meghan remaining in California, before the couple set off for Nigeria on what some are calling an unofficial royal tour.\n\nReports suggest that no senior members of the House of Windsor will be present at the anniversary service of a cause dear to Prince Harry's heart.\n\nIt is also likely that Harry will once again stay in a hotel during his UK visit, rather than residing in one of the many Royal estates.\n\nIn the previous year, Harry and Meghan were asked to leave their UK residence, Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor.\n\nWithout a personal abode in the UK, Harry reportedly requested to stay in Windsor Castle in September 2023, but was denied - allegedly due to the last-minute nature of the request.\n\nSince then, Harry has been staying in hotels during his visits to his home country, amidst an ongoing disagreement with the Home Office regarding his security while in Britain.\n\nThe Sussexes lost their taxpayer-funded police protection when they stepped down as working royals, and it is now up to the royal and VIP Executive Committee to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the duke will receive police protection.\n\nSo far, the legal battle has not been in Harry's favour, but his legal team has indicated their intention to \"challenge the decision\".\n\nIn a positive turn amidst the health challenges confronting the Royal Family, King Charles has received the green light from his medical team to resume certain \"public-facing\" royal engagements.\n\nThis comes as they are satisfied with the progress he's made in his recovery.\n\nInitially restricted to managing state affairs privately, Charles won't immediately return to a full schedule of duties and his future commitments will \"remain subject to doctors' advice\".\n\nThe King's gradual comeback is set to lighten the load on Prince William, who has been juggling his role as a prominent working royal with family duties, especially considering Kate's health issues.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The Duke of Sussex's spokesperson said that due to King Charles' full diary a meeting is not possible.\n\nHarry will attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games at London's St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday May 8. Speculation had been mounting that the Prince, who was highly critical of the Royal Family in his book Spare would meet the king, even if it was for a short time, especially as his dad is undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nHowever, the Sun reported a spokesperson for Harry has responded to \"speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week\".\n\nThey said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry flew to the UK alone without Meghan or their children Archie and Lilibet. But Meghan will join Harry on his visit to Nigeria later this week, it's understood.\n\nIt's understood Harry will not see his brother Prince William - but had been \"keen\" to see his dad while visiting. Charles, 75, resumed public duties last week for the first time since beginning cancer treatment.\n\nHe is now expected to attend the year's first Buckingham Palace garden party. The duke is expected to give a reading at a service of thanksgiving marking a decade since the inaugural Invictus Games London in 2014.\n\nIt will be the first major event he has attended in Britain for some time.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are currently in California with their kids, Archie and Lilibet, celebrating the fifth birthday of their little prince.\n\nAccording to Quinn, many Royal aides are happy that Meghan is skipping the UK portion and meeting Harry in Nigeria for their Royal visit afterward.\n\nKing Charles Wants To Connect More With Prince Archie And Princess Lilibet\n\nQuinn also revealed to the news outlet that amid the disconnect between Harry's family and the rest of the royals, King Charles is still trying to connect with his grandkids and is \"desperate\" for a good relationship with them.\n\nHowever, the monarch is reportedly not a fan of \"new technology\" and is \"uncomfortable\" with making video calls.\n\nHe said, \"If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry, it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan.\"\n\nHarry, Meghan, and Archie previously video-called the palace in April 2020 to wish the late Queen Elizabeth a happy 94th birthday.\n\nAfter Harry and Meghan retired as senior royals in 2020, there was a disconnect between their family and the rest of the Royal family. Since then, the couple has addressed the conflict in multiple projects, which has caused an even bigger divide.\n\nPrince Harry And King Charles Will Meet During The Duke's Visit\n\nBefore his UK trip this week, sources revealed that Harry was \"very keen\" to see his father. He and Charles have reportedly maintained \"regular contact\" after the monarch was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February this year.\n\nAs he receives treatment for the cancer, Charles has finally resumed his public duties and will be present at Buckingham Palace's first garden party on Wednesday.\n\nThe party and Harry's Invictus Games anniversary service are scheduled to conclude around 6 pm, giving father and son the opportunity to meet physically for the first time since February.\n\nA source told The Sun, \"It's clear he is keen to see his father as he continues his recovery, and most people expect another reunion of some kind next week.\"\n\nHarry and Charles' meeting will reportedly not include Prince William, who's going to be busy with engagements in Cornwall and Scilly this week.\n\nThe Waleses Are Reportedly Interested In Having A 'Truce' With The Sussexes\n\nWilliam and Kate have been at loggerheads with Harry and Meghan after they were left feeling \"betrayed\" by revelations from Harry's 2023 memoir \"Spare.\"\n\nBoth families have seemingly snubbed each other on occasions where they had been tipped to reunite and have not spoken with each other since Queen Elizabeth II's funeral in 2022.\n\nHowever, a source recently told US Weekly that the Prince and Princess of Wales want a \"truce\" and are \"open\" to reconciling with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe source explained that William and Kate are considering mending their broken relationship with Harry and Meghan because of their children, as they don't want their feud to be passed on to \"the next generation.\"\n\nThe source stated, \"They want a relationship with Meghan and Harry, and they don't want the acrimony to carry over to the next generation.\"\n\nThe insider added that Meghan and Harry feel the same way: \"Obviously, the Duke and Duchess want their kids to have a relationship with their cousins.\"\n\nPrince Harry And Meghan Markle Are Visiting Nigeria\n\nAfter Harry's UK trip, he and Meghan will reportedly visit Nigeria. Social media users have shared that they're \"overwhelmed with joy\" for the visit and promised a warm welcome to the couple during their time in the country.\n\nThe visit comes two years after Meghan revealed that a genealogy test she did \"a couple of years\" ago revealed she is \"43 percent Nigerian.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Chief of Defence Staff invited the Duke and Duchess of Sussex when he met Harry at the last Invictus Games in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nOn X (formerly Twitter), one user shared their joy for the visit. They wrote, \"Harry and Meghan are coming to Nigeria in May! We cannot wait to welcome them! And our good sis is coming home for the first time.

This time around, sources have claimed that Harry and King Charles definitely intend to see one another again, but there may not have been much movement towards reconciliation with William, with Harry said not to have reached out to his brother ahead of his visit.\n\nA lot has changed since Harry's last visit to the UK, with Princess Kate's own cancer news sending shockwaves across the nation. Harry and Meghan are said to have reached out privately to Kate after learning the emotional announcement just before it was publicly revealed.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex also made a public statement of support for Kate after the announcement, wishing \"health and healing\" for the Princess of Wales, and backing Kate's emotional appeal for privacy as she continues her treatment and focuses on her recovery. While Harry and William did not meet during Harry's last visit to the UK, some commentators have appealed for the brothers - who have long had a strained relationship - to reconcile amid the health challenges facing the royal family.\n\nHarry and Meghan backed Kate's appeal for privacy as she undergoes cancer treatment\n\nHowever, it is not clear yet whether or not Harry and William will reunite while he is in the UK, nor whether the Duke of Sussex will see Kate who he has previously called \"more sister than in-law, the sister I'd never had and always wanted\" in his memoir Spare.\n\nSources told The Mirror that Harry and Charles have stayed in touch since they last saw one another and they plan to meet up while he is in the UK. They said: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHowever, the timing apparently isn't right for the two once-close brothers to reunite. \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time,\" explained a source.\n\nThe brothers have come together a handful of times since Harry stepped back as a working royal and moved across the Atlantic. Notably, the pair reunited for their grandfather Prince Philip's funeral in 2021, which came only weeks after Meghan and Harry sat down with Oprah for a bombshell interview that rocked the public perception of their relationship with the other royals and saw Harry claim that his father and brother were \"trapped\" within the monarchy.\n\nHarry revealed in his memoir that after the funeral he and William had a tense showdown, during which Charles begged them not to make his \"final years a misery\". The duke claimed that William - who has been both his \"beloved brother\" and \"arch nemesis\" over the years - said he had no idea why Harry had decided to leave the UK.\n\nThe brothers came together again when they unveiled a statue dedicated to their mother Diana in July 2021, on what would have been her 60th birthday, and then again to celebrate the late Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022. Only a few months later the brothers were brought back together in further grief, as they mourned the late monarch together, and even managed to share a joke together in the dark moment.\n\nHarry and William have reunited in important moments for the Royal Family despite having a strained relationship\n\nAs they prepared to follow their grandmother's coffin through the streets of London, both brothers were reminded of the moment they had done the same thing for their mother, when they were only children. Harry explained in an interview with ITV a few weeks later: \"Just recently my brother and I were walking the same route, and we sort of joked to each other and said, 'At least we know the way'.\n\n\"It was very similar. The only difference was the levels of emotion. Because our grandmother had finished life. There was more, I think, of a celebration and respect and recognition to what she had accomplished. Whereas our mother was taken away far too young.\"\n\nHarry is visiting the UK to attend a special service at St. Paul's Cathedral to mark 10 years of the Invictus Games - a sports competition for wounded ex-servicepeople that Harry founded in 2014. The Duke is making the trip solo, with Meghan staying behind in California, before the couple head to Nigeria for what some have deemed an unofficial royal tour.\n\nIt has been reported that no senior members of the House of Windsor will be attending the anniversary service of the cause so close to Harry's heart and that he will likely be staying once again in a hotel during his time in the UK, rather than one of the many royal residences.\n\nLast year, Harry and Meghan were \"evicted\" from their UK home of Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor. Without a place to call home of their own in the UK, Harry is reported to have asked permission to stay in Windsor Castle in September 2023, only to have his request rejected - reportedly on the grounds that it was made too last minute.\n\nHarry is set to return to celebrate 10 years of the Invictus Games\n\nAfter this, Harry has stayed in hotels while back in his home country, amid an ongoing dispute with the Home Office over his security whilst he is on British soil. The Sussexes had their taxpayer-funded police security pulled when they stepped back as working royals, and it is now decided by the Royal and VIP Executive Committee on a case-by-case basis whether the Duke will get police security. So far, the legal battle has not gone Harry's way, but his legal team has indicated they intend to \"challenge the decision\".\n\nIn a boost amid the health crises faced by the House of Windsor, King Charles has been given permission by his doctors to return to some \"public-facing\" royal duties, because they are pleased with the progress he's made in his treatment so far. Initially, Charles was limited to conducting business of state behind closed doors, and while he won't be back to a full programme immediately - his engagements will \"remain subject to doctors' advice\". The monarch's return to duty will see some of the burdens eased on Prince William, who has had to balance being one of the most senior royals available to work with his familial responsibilities given his wife's health struggles.\n\nDo you have a story to tell?

He will be attending a \"service of thanksgiving\" at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, 8 May. The Invictus Games Foundation was founded by the Duke in 2014 as a multisport event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women, both serving and veterans.\n\nHowever, Prince Harry will not be seeing his father, King Charles during his trip.

A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex revealed that Prince Harry will not be seeing King Charles due to his full schedule. The spokesperson went on to say that Prince Harry is understanding of his father's commitments.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" a spokesperson for Prince Harry said to People.\n\nPrince Harry joined a panel during his trip to the UK on Tuesday 7 May. As per People, the discussion, \"The IGF Conversation: Realizing a Global Community,\" is set to reflect on the global community of service personnel as well as the families that the Invictus Games has fostered.\n\nThe Mirror reports that Prince Harry was seen visiting Armoury House in East London. The publication also reports that this was less than 1.6km from where his step mother, Queen Camilla was carrying out an engagement at a primary school. Queen Camilla was unveiling a Coronation Library.\n\nKing Charles was reportedly seen leaving Windsor Castle headed to London, where he had been holding audiences at Buckingham Palace.

The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Archie could have had wildly different name as Harry and Meghan 'couldn't decide'\n\nHarry arrived in the capital on Tuesday, travelling without his wife Meghan Markle or their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. It is believed he is undertaking several Invictus Games commitments on Tuesday afternoon and has been seen visiting Armoury House in East London, where he took part in a panel discussion hosted by former BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin at a one-day summit, called the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation.\n\nIt is less than a mile from where Queen Camilla is carrying out an engagement at a primary school, where she is unveiling a Coronation Library. Earlier on Tuesday, the King was also seen leaving Windsor Castle to head to London, where he has been holding audiences at Buckingham Palace. On Wednesday, he is expected to be at a Buckingham Palace garden party - just days after his return to public duties amid his cancer treatment.\n\nHarry has had a frosty relationship with his dad, especially since he was highly critical of his royal relatives in his controversial memoir Spare - and was particularly scathing about his stepmother Camilla. But according to sources, the monarch had been keen to see his son, who now lives in California.\n\nA source said last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's trip to the UK is his second to the UK this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his ailing father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House. It marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.\n\nA reunion with his estranged older brother Prince William also does not seem to be on the cards. An insider said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry will meet up with Meghan later in the week when the pair embark on a tour of Nigeria, where they are expected to meet with military staff.\n\nThe service at St Paul's is scheduled two days after Harry's son Prince Archie celebrates his fifth birthday. Actor Damian Lewis is set to recite the Invictus poem during the service. Representatives from Invictus Games participating nations, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community, will also be in attendance.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The anniversary is being marked with a panel on Tuesday and a service at St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, where Harry will give a reading and Homeland actor Damian Lewis will recite the Invictus poem. (The writer of the poem, William Henley, is commemorated with a memorial bust in the Crypt of the cathedral.)\n\nRelated: Meghan Markle Won't Join Prince Harry in the U.K. Next Month Before Heading to Nigeria Together\n\nThe Duke of Sussex most recently visited the U.K. in February following the news of King Charles' cancer diagnosis. Prince Harry flew from California to see his father at Clarence House in London, where they had a brief private meeting.\n\nA royal source said there were \"no plans\" for brothers Prince Harry and Prince William to get together while the Duke of Sussex was in the U.K. in February. At the time, Kate Middleton was recuperating from her January abdominal surgery. On March 22, the Princess of Wales revealed that post-operative tests from the procedure \"found cancer had been present\" and she had started chemotherapy.\n\nSpeaking about the reunion with his father on Good Morning America shortly after, Prince Harry was asked how he first learned about the monarch's cancer news. He replied, \"I spoke to him. I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could.\"\n\n\"Look, I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that,\" Harry said in the interview.\n\nRegarding his outlook on the King's health, Prince Harry said, \"That stays between me and him.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Yeah, I'm sure. Throughout all these families, I see it on a day-to-day basis, the strength of the family unit coming together.\"\n\n\"I have my own family, as we all do,\" he continued. \"My family and my life in California is as it is. I've got other trips planned that would take me through the U.K. or back to the U.K., so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle moved to her home state of California after they stepped back as working members of the royal family in 2020 and ultimately settled in Montecito. Although Prince Harry has returned to the U.K. on several occasions, including for charity events and court cases he's pursuing, he rarely reunites with King Charles or other family members.\n\nFollowing his trip to the U.K., Prince Harry and Meghan will visit Nigeria. PEOPLE previously confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have accepted an invitation to visit the African country next month on behalf of its Chief of Defense Staff, the highest-ranking military official.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

This afternoon, he visited Armoury House in East London, where he took part in a panel discussion hosted by former BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin at a one-day summit, called the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation.\n\nHis trip to the UK had fuelled rumours he could have a reunion with his father the King as both are in London today and tomorrow.\n\nCharles and Harry won't reunite this week\n\nHarry has only seen his father, with whom he has a rocky bond, once since he was diagnosed with cancer. But any hopes of a reunion were dahsed today when a spokeperson for the Duke said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\"\n\nHowever, tellingly, the statement added that a future meet-up could be on the cards very soon. It added: \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry arrived in the capital today, travelling without his wife Meghan Markle or their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. His visit in East London today saw him take part in a panel discussion hosted by former BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin at a one-day summit, called the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation.\n\nPrince Harry at an Invictus Games event this afternoon in London\n\nIt is less than a mile from where Queen Camilla is carrying out an engagement at a primary school, where she is unveiling a Coronation Library. Earlier today the King was also seen leaving Windsor Castle to head to London, where he has been holding audiences this afternoon at Buckingham Palace. Tomorrow, he is expected to be at a Buckingham Palace garden party - just days after his return to public duties amid his cancer treatment.\n\nHarry has had a frosty relationship with his dad, especially since he was highly critical of his royal relatives in his controversial memoir Spare - and and was particularly scathing about his stepmother Camilla. But according to sources, the monarch had been keen to see his son, who now lives in California.\n\nHarry speaks with Pikemen and Musketeers during the Invictus event today\n\nA source said last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's trip to the UK is his second to Britain this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his ailing father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House. It marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.\n\nA reunion with his estranged older brother Prince William also does not seem to be on the cards either. An insider said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\" Harry will meet up with Meghan later in the week when the pair embark on a tour of Nigeria, where they are expected to meet with military staff.\n\nThe service at St Paul's is scheduled two days after Harry's son Prince Archie celebrates his fifth birthday. Actor Damian Lewis is set to recite the Invictus poem during the service.

The Duke of Sussex made the journey from California to London without Meghan Markle by his side, as he prepares to attend a service at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, a sporting event he founded for wounded servicemen and women.\n\nRoyal editor Chris Ship broke the news on X, formerly Twitter, sharing: \"[Harry] landed here ahead of his St Paul's Cathedral service tomorrow to mark 10 years of the @WeAreInvictus which he founded in 2014. He's doing some Invictus related events today.\"\n\nThe duke is set to reunite with Meghan later this week for a tour of Nigeria, where engagements with military personnel are anticipated.\n\nIn addition to the service at St Paul's, where Prince Harry will deliver a reading, there is speculation about a potential meeting with King Charles, despite their strained relationship.\n\nThe Duke's candid memoir 'Spare' released last year, did not shy away from criticising his Royal family members, including a notably harsh portrayal of Queen Camilla.\n\nA source has disclosed: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nDespite a packed schedule next week, Royal insiders have confirmed that Charles is keen to meet with his son, who has been somewhat estranged.\n\nHarry is expected to remain in the UK for a three-day visit. This trip marks his second visit home this year, following a brief February visit to see Charles after the public learned of the King's cancer diagnosis.\n\nDuring that time, Harry was only able to spend 30 minutes with his father at Clarence House.\n\nThis meeting signalled a potential thawing in their relationship, which suffered after Harry and Meghan stepped back from Royal duties in 2020 and relocated to America. Charles, who resumed his Royal engagements last week, is slated to be in London on Tuesday for his cancer treatment.\n\nRoyal aides have noted that Charles' attendance at events is contingent on how he feels each day. The communication between Harry and his father has \"remained positive\", as revealed by a source.\n\nThe Duke has been sending supportive messages throughout his father's illness. In a recent interview on American television, Harry expressed his hope that the King's diagnosis might lead to a \"reunifying effect\" for the family.\n\nDespite the possibility of Prince Harry seeing his father, it appears a reconciliation with his estranged brother, Prince William, is not on the horizon. A source revealed: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nThe service at St Paul's Cathedral will take place two days after Harry's son, Prince Archie, marks his fifth birthday.

The anniversary is being marked with a panel on Tuesday and a service at St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, where Harry will give a reading and Homeland actor Damian Lewis will recite the Invictus poem. (The writer of the poem, William Henley, is commemorated with a memorial bust in the Crypt of the cathedral.)\n\nRelated: Meghan Markle Won't Join Prince Harry in the U.K. Next Month Before Heading to Nigeria Together\n\nThe Duke of Sussex most recently visited the U.K. in February following the news of King Charles' cancer diagnosis. Prince Harry flew from California to see his father at Clarence House in London, where they had a brief private meeting.\n\nA royal source said there were \"no plans\" for brothers Prince Harry and Prince William to get together while the Duke of Sussex was in the U.K. in February. At the time, Kate Middleton was recuperating from her January abdominal surgery. On March 22, the Princess of Wales revealed that post-operative tests from the procedure \"found cancer had been present\" and she had started chemotherapy.\n\nSpeaking about the reunion with his father on Good Morning America shortly after, Prince Harry was asked how he first learned about the monarch's cancer news. He replied, \"I spoke to him. I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could.\"\n\n\"Look, I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that,\" Harry said in the interview.\n\nRegarding his outlook on the King's health, Prince Harry said, \"That stays between me and him.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Yeah, I'm sure. Throughout all these families, I see it on a day-to-day basis, the strength of the family unit coming together.\"\n\n\"I have my own family, as we all do,\" he continued. \"My family and my life in California is as it is. I've got other trips planned that would take me through the U.K. or back to the U.K., so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle moved to her home state of California after they stepped back as working members of the royal family in 2020 and ultimately settled in Montecito. Although Prince Harry has returned to the U.K. on several occasions, including for charity events and court cases he's pursuing, he rarely reunites with King Charles or other family members.\n\nFollowing his trip to the U.K., Prince Harry and Meghan will visit Nigeria. PEOPLE previously confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have accepted an invitation to visit the African country next month on behalf of its Chief of Defense Staff, the highest-ranking military official.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nPrince Harry returned to his home country for celebrations surrounding the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, which had its inaugural competition for wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veterans 10 years ago in London. The anniversary is being marked with a panel on Tuesday and a service at St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, where Harry will give a reading and Homeland actor Damian Lewis will recite the Invictus poem. (The writer of the poem, William Henley, is commemorated with a memorial bust in the Crypt of the cathedral.)\n\nThe Duke of Sussex most recently visited the U.K. in February following the news of King Charles' cancer diagnosis. Prince Harry flew from California to see his father, 75, at Clarence House in London, where they had a brief private meeting.\n\nA royal source said there were \"no plans\" for brothers Prince Harry and Prince William to get together while the Duke of Sussex was in the U.K. in February. At the time, Kate Middleton was recuperating from her January abdominal surgery. On March 22, the Princess of Wales revealed that post-operative tests from the procedure \"found cancer had been present\" and she had started chemotherapy.\n\nSpeaking about the reunion with his father on Good Morning America shortly after, Prince Harry was asked how he first learned about the monarch's cancer news. He replied, \"I spoke to him. I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could.\"\n\n\"Look, I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that,\" Harry said in the interview.\n\nRegarding his outlook on the King's health, Prince Harry said, \"That stays between me and him.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\nAs for whether King Charles' diagnosis could have a \"reunifying effect\" on the royal family, Harry, who was connecting with Invictus Games competitors and their families in Canada at the Winter Training Camp at the time, said: \"Absolutely. Yeah, I'm sure. Throughout all these families, I see it on a day-to-day basis, the strength of the family unit coming together.\"\n\n\"I have my own family, as we all do,\" he continued. \"My family and my life in California is as it is. I've got other trips planned that would take me through the U.K. or back to the U.K., so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle moved to her home state of California after they stepped back as working members of the royal family in 2020 and ultimately settled in Montecito. Although Prince Harry has returned to the U.K. on several occasions, including for charity events and court cases he's pursuing, he rarely reunites with King Charles or other family members.\n\nFollowing his trip to the U.K., Prince Harry and Meghan will visit Nigeria.

But according to sources, the monarch had been keen to see his son, who now lives in California.\n\nA source said last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's trip to the UK is his second to Britain this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his ailing father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House. It marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.\n\nA reunion with his estranged older brother Prince William does not seem to be on the cards either. An insider said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry has travelled to the UK without wife Meghan Markle or his children He will meet up with her later in the week when the pair embark on a tour of Nigeria, where they are expected to meet with military staff.\n\nThe service at St Paul's is scheduled two days after Harry's son Prince Archie celebrates his fifth birthday.

Harry only spent 24 hours in his home country, and reports alleged he only met with King Charles and Queen Camilla for 40 minutes.\n\nPrior to that, the Duke of Sussex hadn't been back to England since the King's coronation in May 2023.\n\nHarry and his wife Meghan Markle's decision to step down as senior working royals in 2020 caused a huge stir within the royal family, and their subsequent move to the United States seemingly put even more distance, both physical and emotional, between Harry and his father.\n\nHarry and Meghan's children have little to no relationship with their grandparents and the King would reportedly love to see them more.\n\nA source close to the royal household told PEOPLE: \"hopefully [Harry] will bring the grandchildren at some point, as that would be lovely for all of them,\" particularly in the wake of Charles' cancer battle.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's 2021 interview with Oprah seemingly added fuel to the fire in terms of their already-tumultuous relationship.\n\nHarry attended his grandfather Prince Philip's funeral in the UK and had a conversation with his father, brother and sister-in-law, following which a source told The Sun that \"Harry, William, and Charles focused on reaching some form of peace and stability within the family moving forward.\n\n\"The conversations were focused less on what has happened and what was said with Oprah and more on how to move forward as a family. And that is not an easy path, it requires time and understanding.\"\n\nThe source added: \"Charles felt aggrieved at how the family's personal affairs and family dramas were expressed in such an 'insensitive' way.\"\n\nPrior to the late Queen Elizabeth's death in 2022, sources told The Mirror that the Sussexes were invited to spend the summer with the King at his Balmoral estate, but they declined the invitation.\n\n\"The Prince of Wales reiterated his invitation for Harry and Meghan, and the whole family if they wished, to come and stay with him this summer while he is at his home on the Balmoral estate.\n\n\"He thought it might be a good opportunity for everyone to take stock and relax, but the invitation was declined,\" a source claimed.\n\nThe release of Harry and Meghan's Netflix docuseries as well as Prince Harry's memoir Spare both unveiled some details and revelations about the royal family, and as a result the King was \"distraught\", according to a source who spoke to Us Weekly.\n\n\"[Charles is] angry and outraged that Harry's aired so many embarrassing and damaging assertions, and it's put him in a terrible position with [Queen Consort] Camilla of course now that she's been dragged into the equation.\n\n\"That's really crossed the line in more ways than one, but there are so many egregious comments and revelations from Harry that his father doesn't know where to start. He has hope that in time the dust will settle and Harry will soften his heart toward his family, at least he hopes so.

Harry, who stepped back from the royal family in 2020, will make an appearance at the Service of Thanksgiving and stay briefly in the UK before he later joins wife Meghan Markle as the couple make a joint appearance in Nigeria.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry's grievances 'pathetic' in face of Kate Middleton's 'very real' problem - expert\n\nREAD MORE: Reason Prince Harry is unlikely to bring Archie and Lilibet to the UK after Meghan Markle snub\n\nPrince Harry is visiting the UK solo for a celebration of the Invictus Games The Duke of Sussex is likely to stay in a London hotel over a royal residence\n\nHarry's UK visit also marks the first time that Harry will have returned to the UK since he flew to the country in February after King Charles' cancer diagnosis was revealed. Harry flew to see his father and was in the country for just 25 hours following the health update, where it was rumoured he saw the King only for a brief 30-minute meeting, which is believed to be their first proper private conversation for 15 months.\n\nDuring his brief stay and despite the royals having a wealth of lavish properties in London, Harry opted to stay in a London hotel instead. He did the same thing when he was in London for the Well Child Awards back in September and it's likely the Duke will again stay in a hotel over a royal residence this week when he stays in the UK. Whilst the exact hotel is not widely known, it's thought to be The Goring Hotel with rooms available at around \u00a38k per night and he could likely rebook this again for his Invictus trip.\n\nHarry is effectively homeless when he visits his home country of the United Kingdom, following his eviction from Frogmore Cottage last year, with him reportedly denied permission to stay there during last year's trip. However, there are believed to be rooms at Buckingham Palace, Clarence House, Kensington Palace and Windsor Castle that are typically made available to him should he wish to use them.\n\nIt's been said that a meeting between Harry and his brother Prince William and wife Princess Kate is unlikely\n\nIt was thought that when Harry was in the UK he might meet with his older brother Prince William and Princess Kate, but a meeting has now been ruled out between them. William and Kate - who is currently receiving cancer treatment - are said to have no intention of seeing Harry. An alleged friend of the couple told the Daily Beast: \"Both sides understand each other's position clearly. William and Catherine felt completely betrayed by Harry's memoir. They don't speak to Harry and Meghan, and they are certainly not about to start when Catherine is at her most vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an insider told The Mirror's Royal Editor Russel Myers: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

Amid his strained relationship with the royals, none are expected to attend the celebration - but what about behind closed doors?\n\nThere has been speculation that Harry will spend some time with his father, the King. The father-and-son relationship has become fraught following Harry's decision to step down as a working royal, and the allegations made in his tell-all memoir, Spare.\n\nPrince Harry saw his father earlier this year during a fleeting visit The pair back in 2019\n\nLast week, a source told the Mirror: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nRoyal sources insisted that despite having a busy diary this week, Charles intends to see his estranged son. Aides said his movements are dependent on how he is feeling on any day. Harry's contact with his dad has \"remained positive\", a source revealed.\n\nThey last saw each other in February after the King's cancer diagnosis was made public. Harry flew back to the UK but only spent 30 minutes with his father on the whirlwind trip, which saw him spend just over 24 hours in his home country.\n\nHarry went straight to Clarence House to see King Charles and he was photographed arriving at his father's residence at about 3.15 in the afternoon with a police escort. Yet just 30 minutes later, the King and Queen were seen waving to crowds as they left Clarence House, signifying that the meeting between father and son was over and didn't last long.\n\nFollowing that fleeting visit, Harry told US TV that he was lucky to spend time with his dad and talked about how ill health could have a reunifying effect on families.\n\nHarry and Meghan with Charles at Trooping the Colour in 2018\n\nOn Wednesday, the day of the Invictus service, Charles is scheduled to have his weekly audience with the Prime Minister before attending the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season, medical advice permitting. He is also understood to have various appointments and engagements scheduled for the rest of the week.\n\nNevertheless, Harry will no doubt hope to see his father again, should their diaries permit. And it is thought that Charles will make time to see him if he is able. Royal author Ingrid Seward believes Harry will reunite with his father as the King will want to \"make an effort to see his son\".\n\nDuring an appearance on GB News, Ingrid said: \"I don't think we're going to see William and Harry together. But I do think that King Charles will make an effort to see his son. He'll want to see him. They'll both be in London at the same time, I believe, because it's the Prime Minister's meeting. So there is no real reason why Harry shouldn't see his father.\"\n\nGiven that Harry and Meghan live permanently in the UK, Charles rarely gets the opportunity to see his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet. Just like the late Queen, he met Lilibet for the first time in June 2022 when the Sussexes travelled back to Britain for the Platinum Jubilee. To date, it remains the only time they have met in person.\n\nHarry's has had a rocky relationship with his royal relatives\n\nThat meeting was reportedly \"very emotional\" for Charles, not least because it was the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's first visit to the UK since they stepped down from royal duties and moved to the US in 2020, taking their young son Archie with them.\n\nA senior royal source was quoted as saying that Charles and Camilla were delighted to see Harry and Meghan in the UK again. \"The Prince and the Duchess were absolutely thrilled to see them. The Prince, of course, hasn't seen his grandson Archie for a bit of time and so it was very, very, very special to have some time with him. He hadn't met Lili, his granddaughter, and so to meet her was very emotional, a very, very wonderful thing.\"\n\nSince then, relations between the Sussexes and the rest of the royal family have become more distant. Citing security concerns, Harry and Meghan have chosen not to return with their children since June 2022; the couple later attended the Queen's funeral together, while Harry went to Charles's Coronation on his own. Similarly, he has been alone for his visits to London for court hearings.\n\nThe King made his return to public duties just last week after taking some time out for his cancer treatment. He poignantly met fellow cancer patients and bravely told them how he felt receiving his own diagnosis.\n\nCharles candidly described the experience of being told he had the disease when he visited University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in London, and he also reassured those who asked about the state of his health, saying \"I'm well\" during his first public-facing event since being diagnosed in early February.\n\nThe head of state went on impromptu walkabouts meeting staff at the centre who had stopped to catch a glimpse of the couple. He sympathised with one cancer patient as she received her chemotherapy with many others in a day unit, telling Lesley Woodbridge, 63 as he held her hand: \"It's always a bit of a shock isn't it, when they tell you.\" A clearly emotional Charles went on to say: \"I've got to have my treatment this afternoon as well.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace recently confirmed that the King is still undergoing cancer treatment and it was too early to say how long it would continue. But a spokesperson said: \"His Majesty's medical team are very encouraged by the progress made so far and remain positive about the King's continued recovery\". Charles' diary of forthcoming events will not be a full summer programme, with his attendance announced nearer the time \"subject to doctors' advice\", according to the Palace.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?

A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex claimed that it is \"not possible\" for him to see his father due to the king's \"full\" schedule. \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" said Prince Harry's Spokesperson. The statement expressed that Prince Harry is \"of course\" understanding of King Charles' royal commitments, and he \"hopes to see him soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "wataugademocrat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Watauga Democrat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Event_Planning_and_Production", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Event Planning and Production", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wataugademocrat.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/10/310e9056-59c1-5419-b3fb-e3e792f92099/663b5f118f14c.image.jpg?crop=612%2C321%2C0%2C11&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

He looks set to meet up with his father King Charles, with the pair both scheduled to be in London together on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, it appears there will be no reunion between feuding brothers Harry and Prince William as their relationship continues to be frosty. A source said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry is not expected to meet with Prince William\n\nAnd reflecting on the brothers' seemingly ongoing rift following William's wife Kate revealing her cancer diagnosis, former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond told OK!: \"As regards to William, that does appear to be a terminally damaged relationship. In a way, it seems the boot is now very much on the other foot. Previously it was Harry who was the 'victim' looking for an apology for all his perceived grievances.\n\n\"Now those grievances must seem utterly trivial, even to Harry, in the face of a very real problem: cancer. Catherine and William are involved in a frightening fight and I don't think they have the will or the strength to confront someone, even a brother, who picked a fight over issues that seem pathetic by comparison.\"\n\nHarry with his father King Charles\n\nHarry is expected to be in the UK until Thursday when he will meet up with wife Meghan Markle in Nigeria, where the couple are invited to take part in cultural activities. They are expected to meet military staff during the trip, which is linked to the Invictus Games. It is their first trip to the African nation, which holds a special place in Meghan's heart having revealed last year she is \"43 per cent \u00adNigerian\".\n\nHowever, while in London, the signs point towards Harry meeting up with his father. A source said: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\" Royal sources insisted that despite having a busy diary next week, Charles intends to see his estranged son.\n\nIt will be Harry's second time in Britain this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House. It marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US.\n\nAides said the King's movements are dependent on how he is feeling on any day. Harry's contact with his dad has \"remained positive\", a source revealed. The Duke has sent messages of support during his cancer battle. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_Bond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennie Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32513626.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Party-At-The-Palace.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

For the anniversary of the Invictus Games, Harry returns to his old home, although he usually cites security concerns as the reason he cannot be in Great Britain more often.\n\nThere could have been many reasons why Harry had come to London. King Charles III and Harry's sister-in-law and Princess Kate are both suffering from cancer, with at least Charles reportedly visiting Harry briefly in February.\n\nBut now it's clear: there will be no meeting with his father on Harry's final trip to London. A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex officially confirmed this. Royal experts are now analyzing the situation.\n\nHarry arrived in the UK on Tuesday. The Duke of Sussex wants to attend a mass there to mark the anniversary of the Invictus Games. The first ever Veterans Games were held in London in 2014, and this year the competitions themselves and the foundation behind them celebrate their 10th anniversary.\n\nThe question of whether Harry will take advantage of the opportunity to meet the King has preoccupied the British press and royal fans for weeks. A spokesperson for Harry has now commented on this. as \"daily MailHe writes and says in a statement:\n\nThe statement continued that Harry \"of course understands his father's agenda and other priorities.\" The prince also hopes to be able to meet his father soon.\n\nRoyal experts agree that the fact that Charles will not welcome Harry is a clear sign. \"Whatever the regulatory hurdles, this will be viewed as a snub.\"Richard Fitzwilliams is sure of it, according to the Daily Mail.\n\n\"This is a huge snub,\" said Michael Cole, a former royal correspondent for the BBC. \"The fact that the king will not meet his youngest son, Prince Harry, even though the two men are only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, is an indication.\" About how deep the gap really is.\"\n\nExperts agree that Charles's decision not to meet Harry is a clear reference to the Duke of Sussex.\n\nCole is sure that Harry is not welcome at court right now. He believes that \"Harry will see it for what it is: the clearest possible indication of the pain he has caused.\" His bitter conclusion:\n\nThe expert believes that even the Duke of Sussex may now understand the message behind it.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the situation develops in the end and whether Charles does not have time to meet Harry.\n\nWhile nothing is known about a meeting between Harry and his brother William or Kate, it is still possible that Harry will meet members of the royal family upon his return. British media are speculating that Zara Tindall and Harry's cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, could attend the anniversary celebration of the Invictus Games.

And given his fractured relations with the Royal Family, he is likely feeling some trepidation.\n\nThere has been much speculation about whether Harry will reunite with his older brother, Prince William and sister-in-law Princess Kate, during his time in the UK. But, it seems that decision has been made for him.\n\nWilliam and Kate - who is receiving cancer treatment - are said to have no intention of seeing Harry for one simple reason; he has broken their trust.\n\nAn alleged friend of the couple told the Daily Beast: \"Both sides understand each other's position clearly. William and Catherine felt completely betrayed by Harry's memoir. They don't speak to Harry and Meghan, and they are certainly not about to start when Catherine is at her most vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an insider told The Mirror's Royal Editor Russel Myers: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nAnother insider claimed that the brothers haven't managed to have a breakthrough in their tense relationship - despite Harry and Meghan sending well-wishes to Kate following her cancer news. \"A 'get well soon' message is neither here nor there. But the whole situation doesn't use up a huge amount of their mental energy any more. William and Kate have accepted it and moved on,\" they told the Daily Beast.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is set to make a public appearance on Wednesday when he gives a reading at St Paul's Cathedral in honour of the Invictus Games. Actor Damian Lewis is expected to recite a poem at the event.\n\nA statement published on the Invictus Games' social media accounts read: \"The Invictus Games Foundation will celebrate 10 years of changing lives and saving lives with a 'Service of Thanksgiving' at St Paul's Cathedral on May 8th. We will be joined by our Patron, Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, actor Damian Lewis and members of the worldwide Invictus Community to mark the occasion.\"\n\nIt is understood that Prince Harry hopes to meet up with his father King Charles during his trip. A source told The Mirror: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nThe trip to London will mark Harry's first visit to the city since he dashed back to the UK in February in the hours after the King's cancer diagnosis was made public. At that time, Harry spent just 30 minutes with his dad on a whirlwind trip that saw him spend just 24 hours in his home country.\n\nAfter his February trip, Harry told US TV that he was lucky to spend time with his father and talked about how ill health could have a reunifying effect on families.\n\nOn the day Harry is in London for the Invictus service, the publication says Charles has his weekly audience with the Prime Minister. He is also expected to appear at the first of the annual Buckingham Palace garden parties.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?

Flying solo and without his wife, Harry is now in the UK alone to celebrate the Invictus Games.\n\nITV's royal editor From Chris Ship confirmed at 1pm this afternoon: \"Prince Harry is in the UK. He landed here ahead of his St Paul's Cathedral service tomorrow to mark 10 years of the @WeAreInvictus which he founded in 2014.

Meghan will not accompany Harry to the St Paul's Cathedral in London tomorrow. But she will be with Harry for their visit to Nigeria later this week.\"\n\nHarry is scheduled to give a reading during the event on May 8. The service will take place at St Paul's Cathedral, the same place his parents got married. Meghan has turned down her invitation to the event after she was warned by veterans that the Invictus Games 'lost meaning' with her involvement.\n\nAs well as Prince Harry set to give a reading during the service, actor Damian Lewis will also recite a poem. The Duke of Sussex was last seen in the UK in February for a brief visit to see King Charles after his cancer diagnosis, with this visit to the UK his first since learning of Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe service held in the city is for the Invictus Games' 10th anniversary. Prince Harry co-founded the international multi-sport event first held in 2014. The games are for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women, both serving and veterans.\n\nIn recent years, the Duke of Sussex has kept his distance from the United Kingdom, which follows on from him and his wife Meghan stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. Shortly after they revealed they would be stepping back, the couple decided to move from their home in Windsor, England to Montecito in California.\n\nSince moving across the pond, the couple have built up their brand, with them taking part in various projects. Since departing the Royal Family, the couple has teamed up with the likes of Spotify, Penguin Random House, and Netflix.\n\nWith two new Netflix shows in the works, one about polo and one about gardening and cookery, the couple are currently working hard on making names for themselves in Hollywood. Meghan is even working on hard-launching her own lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

'There's been much media speculation that father and son would meet. While that always looked like guessing, I'd have guessed they would meet too.'\n\nHarry is understood to have various Invictus Games commitments today, according to ITV . Tomorrow, he is set to give a reading at a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral marking a decade since the inaugural competition in London in 2014.\n\nPrince Harry at Armoury House in London this afternoon for an Invictus Games discussion called 'Realising a Global Community' hosted by Louise Minchin, ahead of the service\n\nHarry at Armoury House in London today for an Invictus Games panel with Louise Minchin\n\nHarry at Armoury House in London today for an Invictus Games panel with Louise Minchin\n\nPrince Harry at Armoury House in London this afternoon for an Invictus Games discussion\n\nPrince Harry is seen at Armoury House in London today attending an Invictus Games event\n\nOrganisers had said there was no confirmation of any other royals attending, or if Harry's wife Meghan Markle or children Archie and Lilibet would also be in the UK.\n\nBut Harry arrived in London by himself today, and is expected to join the Duchess on a tour to Nigeria later this week with Meghan set to fly there from the US by herself.\n\nAnd Harry is not anticipated to see his brother Prince William , who is scheduled to be away from the capital on Thursday and Friday, or his sister-in-law Kate Middleton whose cancer treatment continues following her revealing the diagnosis in March.\n\nEarlier today, Charles was photographed being driven from Windsor Castle before arriving at Clarence House in London soon after. The King later held an audience nearby at Buckingham Palace with the Prime Minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka.\n\nThe Duke has invited William and other senior members of the Royal Family to the service but none of them are expected to attend, sources told Page Six in the US.\n\nAmong the royals who could attend include his cousins Zara Tindall and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, but there has been no confirmation of this.

The games, which Prince Harry founded after his time in the British Army as an air controller -- are held each year in support of sick and wounded service members.\n\nIn photos posted online, the Spare author can be seen making his grand entrance into the event and greeting eventgoers before stepping on stage for a panel. While inside, the group took part in the \"IGF Conversation: Realising a Global Community\" discussion ahead of the kickoff of the games.\n\nWhile the event has been held in Germany, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands in previous years, this year's festivities -- the 10th of their kind -- just so happen to take place in Harry's home country. 2025's event will be set in Vancouver.\n\nThis year, all eyes will be on the second son of the late Princess Diana and King Charles III as he has been living across the pond in the U.S. with Meghan and their two children. While they stepped back several years ago now, recent illnesses in the royal family -- including both Kate Middleton and King Charles receiving cancer diagnoses -- have caused many to wonder if Prince Harry might reconsider his decision to leave.\n\nAfter news broke that his father was undergoing cancer treatment, ET confirmed that Charles' younger son had rapidly flown to the U.K. to visit with his father, albeit for a brief period of time -- reportedly just a few hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, a rep for the Duke of Sussex shared with ET that despite their proximity to each other, Prince Harry would not be visiting his father on this trip due to his packed schedule for the Invictus Games.\n\nA spokesperson for Prince Harry told ET, \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\"\n\nThe rep added, \"The duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nIt's another case of \"so close but so far\" with his immediate family in England after Harry and Prince William both attended a memorial event for their mom -- Harry virtually and William in person -- and narrowly avoided each other. The royal rift seems to be worse than ever for the brothers a full year after barely acknowledging each other during their father's coronation.\n\nThe ice may be thawing, however, as ET learned back in March that Meghan, 42, and Harry privately reached out to Prince William, 41, and the Princess of Wales, 42, following her cancer diagnosis.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-05/GettyImages-2151906473.jpg?h=ed3ca141", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 310, "textEnd": 320}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

And the King, who has just returned to public duties following his cancer diagnosis, is at Buckingham Palace today for meetings and an expected appearance at a garden party.\n\nDuring his visit to Britain, it had been thought Harry could meet with his father, with whom he has a rocky bond, but it seems it is not possible. A spokesperson for the Duke said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry pictured in London yesterday\n\nAnd historian and royal expert Dr Tessa Dunlop believes the rebuff from Harry will feel \"all too familiar\" to him. She told the Mirror: \"Today, the King doesn't have time to fit the Duke of Sussex into his schedule. Oof. What a gut punch for Prince Harry. Charles - still receiving treatment for cancer and having recently returned to limited public duties - has numerous legitimate excuses that exempt him from a rendezvous.\n\n\"Meanwhile Harry's spokesperson insisted the Duke 'is of course understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.' But for the prince, the rebuff will feel all too familiar. Lest we forget, Harry grew up in boarding school with warring parents and a father who all too often had other priorities.\n\n\"Before the King's cancer diagnosis, the Duke of Sussex admitted in Spare that Charles wasn't cut out to be a single parent - distracted as he was with royal duties and other relationships. Now, once more, Harry finds himself bottom of the list. Other commitments come first.\n\nCharles and Harry won't reunite this week\n\n\"Compounding the Duke's displacement came news yesterday that Prince William has been handed the role of colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps when it was Harry who flew with them in Afghanistan. Ouch. Many will say the Prince brought all this on himself.\n\n\"Why should the frail King prioritise his youngest son? Certainly, the Sussexes' tell-all publications and broadcasts went well outside acceptable royal and familial lines. But if not redemption now, then when?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tessa added that despite the seeming differences between father and son, there is proof they still have much in common. She said: \"After a very fleeting window of opportunity with Charles in the wake of the King's February cancer announcement, Harry told ABC he was 'grateful' for the time he spent with his father.\n\n\"It was a glimmer of hope for a more amicable future and many presumed a further meeting would be forthcoming in the wake of today's Invictus Games anniversary celebration. Instead, the Duke will give a reading in St Paul's Cathedral, the epic venue of his parents' fated wedding, with no significant members of the royal family by his side.\n\n\"It is painfully ironic that Harry is back in London, working for a good cause, in a venue intrinsically associated with the British royal family. Today, every step of the way, he will shadowbox his former life, trapped in the web of monarchy that is apparently impossible to escape, only now he is outside the institution, looking in.\n\n\"Meanwhile the Prince's father will be down the road, blocked by ill health, and what a Sussex spokesperson described as a 'full programme.' Here's hoping the King manages to find time to at least watch his son on television. There he will see that beyond all the mistakes and pain, Harry, in his capacity as Invictus founder and inspiration, continues to change lives for the better. Proof surely that the two men still have much in common?\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_duties", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public duties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessa_Dunlop", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tessa Dunlop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boarding school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32762719.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2SOCIAL-IMAGE-Mirror-exclusive-right-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

However, it appears that a reunion is off the cards.\n\nThe reason Prince William and Kate, who is currently undergoing cancer treatment, are reportedly steering clear of Harry is straightforward: a breach of trust.\n\nREAD MORE -Tom Cruise's rarely-seen daughter who lives a humble life in Croydon\n\nREAD MORE -King Charles' four-word response to Harry's olive branch as he asks to meet\n\nA source close to the couple disclosed to the Daily Beast: \"Both sides understand each other's position clearly. William and Catherine felt completely betrayed by Harry's memoir. They don't speak to Harry and Meghan, and they are certainly not about to start when Catherine is at her most vulnerable.\"\n\nAdding to this, an insider conveyed to The Mirror's Royal Editor Russel Myers: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nAn insider has revealed that despite Prince Harry and Meghan extending their best wishes to Kate after her cancer diagnosis, there's been no significant thaw in the frosty relations between the brothers. \"A 'get well soon' message is neither here nor there. But the whole situation doesn't use up a huge amount of their mental energy any more. William and Kate have accepted it and moved on,\" they disclosed to the Daily Beast.\n\nPrince Harry is scheduled to make an appearance this Wednesday, where he will deliver a reading at St Paul's Cathedral to honour the Invictus Games.

We will be joined by our Patron, Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, actor Damian Lewis and members of the worldwide Invictus Community to mark the occasion.\"\n\nIt's reported that during his visit, Prince Harry is keen to catch up with King Charles. A source confided to The Mirror: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's journey to London will be his first since he hurriedly returned to the UK in February, following the public announcement of the King's cancer diagnosis. During that brief visit, Harry spent a mere 30 minutes with his father, staying in his home country for just 24 hours.\n\nFollowing his February visit, Harry shared with US television that he felt fortunate to have spent time with his father, discussing how health crises can bring families closer together.\n\nOn the day of Harry's presence in London for the Invictus service, reports suggest that Charles has his regular meeting with the Prime Minister.

The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex's relationship with his father has been notably cool, particularly after the release of his explosive memoir 'Spare', where he didn't hold back on his criticisms of the Royal Family, including sharp words about his stepmother, Queen Camilla. Nonetheless, sources close to the situation have indicated that King Charles was eager to reunite with his son, who has made his home across the pond in California.\n\nAn insider revealed last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nIn his second UK visit this year, Harry stopped by for a brief encounter with his cancer-stricken dad, Charles, at Clarence House. Allocated just 30 minutes, the visit occurred a day after Charles' illness was made public.\n\nThe visit served as a healing step in their strained relationship, stemming from Harry and Meghan's decision to abandon royal duties in 2020, relocating to America. During a recent US television interview, Harry expressed optimism that his father's diagnosis would cultivate a \"reunifying effect\" among the family.\n\nChances of a reunion with his estranged elder brother, Prince William, however, appear slim. An inside source revealed: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry ventured to the UK solo without Meghan Markle and their children. He will reunite with Meghan later in the week as they set off on a tour to Nigeria where a meeting with military staff awaits.\n\nSt Paul's service coincides two days after the fifth birthday of Harry's son, Prince Archie. British actor Damian Lewis is slated to recite the Invictus poem during the service, which will see wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veterans among those present.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

It is his first time back home since February, and the Duke of Sussex may make time to visit his sick father.\n\nHowever, Harry's desire might not come to fruition because his stepmother, Queen Camilla, doesn't trust him. According to royal expert Angela Levin, no one in the palace wants to see the estranged Duke except King Charles. In her words,\n\n\"King Charles will because he's a father, and fathers love their children even if they go way off and behave very badly.\"\n\nLevin told GB News that a time constraint might make it impossible for Harry to visit the King. However, the biggest obstacle to the father-son meeting is the Queen. The expert stated in good confidence that Camilla isn't on board with Harry seeing his father.\n\n\"I also know that Queen Camilla will not Harry talk alone to his father. He can't be trusted and I think King Charles is vulnerable.\"\n\nLevin added, \"He [Harry] might say something about his health, which you can absolutely bet will go around everybody because it will make Harry a lot of money.\"\n\nPrior to Levin's shocking revelation, another royal expert shared that the King was open to reconciling with Prince Harry. However, the reconciliation will not involve his daughter-in-law, Meghan Markle, as it is believed she would \"overshadow the message of service.\"\n\nAlso, the King is reportedly not over the Duchess of Sussex's wrongs and can't build trust with her yet. \"Meghan is toxic,\" author Richard Fitzgerald disclosed. \"I'm not saying the Sussexes would launch any attacks on the Royal Family at this sort of time. But what is very, very, clear is that if they want to build trust, they have a long way to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fiyin_olowokandi@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Fiyin Olowokandi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Charles-Queen-Camilla-and-Prince-Harry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 564, "textEnd": 569}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Since its inception, the Invictus Games have been held in various cities, including Orlando, Toronto, Sydney, D\u00fcsseldorf, and The Hague.\n\nFollowing his London visit, Prince Harry will

charity and beginning his carefully managed comeback after the monarch's own cancer diagnosis sidelined him for three months.\n\nThe event was the king's first formal public engagement since Feb. 6, when Buckingham Palace announced that he would be taking a break from public duties to focus on his treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla met with patients and

A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said, \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nSince the King returned to public duties last week, Buckingham Palace is very carefully managing the King's diary to minimize any and all risks to the monarch's health. Although he is back in the public eye, Buckingham Palace was quick to reiterate that this isn't a full return to royal duties, and that the King's cancer has not gone.\n\nHis health remains in the balance, with some sources telling me he isn't as well as he would like us to believe, hence why this isn't the full return that royal watchers and the King himself would have wanted.\n\nThe palace has also said that it will not comment on matters relating to Prince Harry. The optics on this are pretty terrible and this a real setback for royal unity. Where perhaps we thought we had seen a thawing in relations earlier on this year, when Prince Harry dashed back to the U.K. to see the King after his cancer diagnosis, things are looking as frosty as ever between the King and his youngest son. A public reconciliation is not on the cards - not yet, anyway.\n\nAs the public and media's eyes are set on Prince Harry and the celebrating 10 years of the Invictus Games, the absence of Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, adds layers of intrigue to the unfolding narrative of their relationship with the rest of the Royal Family.\n\nThe anticipation of how these developments might influence reunions within the Royal Family, amidst a continuous global fascination with Harry and Meghan news (jam wars anyone?), underscores the global intrigue surrounding their movements and decisions. This scenario, set against the prestigious backdrop of London's St. Paul's Cathedral, magnifies the intersection between personal milestones and royal duties, hinting at significant implications for royal unity and public perception.\n\nMeghan Markle's decision not to accompany Prince Harry during this visit to London has led to speculation as to the reason why she has decided to stay away. It perhaps could be due to security concerns, as the Sussexes now rely on costly private security measures instead of government-funded security. Or maybe she just doesn't feel like being cannon fodder for the tabloid newspapers who haven't been very kind to her in the past.\n\nMedia coverage of Meghan's attendance at high-profile events, like Beyonc\u00e9's concerts, is often perceived as an attempt to bask in reflected glory rather than focusing on her achievements. Her involvement in the Invictus Games also remains uncertain, with initial plans for her participation having been altered.\n\nKing Charles III has recently extended an invitation to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their children to join him at Balmoral Castle. This gesture is viewed as a significant opportunity for a family reunion and a test of Prince Harry's commitment to his family ties. In response, the ball is now in Prince Harry's court to accept or decline this invitation, a decision that will significantly indicate his intentions towards his family.\n\nAlthough we know there will be no reunion this time around, the anticipation around it is high. Furthermore, Prince Harry's recent interviews indicated his openness to reconciliation, stating his willingness to move past previous disagreements. Sitting down with journalist Tom Bradby last year, during the press run ahead of the release of his book \"Spare,\" Prince Harry said he wants his father and his brother back, but as \"a family, not an institution.\"\n\nHowever, the relationship between Prince Harry and Prince William remains strained, with private expressions from Harry showing a desire to resolve issues directly with his brother. This ongoing narrative of reconciliation and potential family reunions plays a crucial role in shaping the public and media's perception of the Royal Family, as they navigate their complex and slightly messy interpersonal dynamics amid public and private life.\n\nThe public and media perception of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has been significantly shaped by various incidents and their responses to Royal Family dynamics. The release of Omid Scobie's book \"Endgame\" has added fuel to the ongoing royal racism controversy, implicating figures such as King Charles and the Princess of Wales.\n\nAdditionally, the couple's candid remarks about the Royal Family have further strained their relationships within the royal household. British tabloids have played a pivotal role in shaping the couple's decision to step back from royal duties, often presenting them in a contentious light. The narrative around Prince Harry and Meghan continues to evolve as they navigate their roles outside the traditional royal framework, with each public appearance and project adding layers to public and media perception.\n\nDespite ongoing tensions, Prince Harry and Meghan continue to attend major U.K. events, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining connections with the Royal Family. These events include the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee, her funeral and the King's coronation, highlighting their ongoing ties to significant royal occasions.\n\nHowever, recent developments have strained these efforts. Prince Harry's legal battle against the U.K. government over security arrangements has highlighted his challenges with the royal establishment since stepping back from official duties. This has inevitably affected his and Meghan's ability to participate freely in family and public events.\n\nFurthermore, King Charles III's recent health challenges and the Princess of Wales' recovery have limited their public engagements. This situation could have provided an opportunity for Prince Harry to step in and support the Royal Family, yet the security ruling has likely closed this window, complicating any potential for increased involvement.\n\nThe ruling on security arrangements not only affects Prince Harry's visits but also impacts the frequency of visits by Meghan and their children, Archie and Lilibet. This decision could deepen their disconnection from Royal Family engagements, affecting the unity and public perception of the family's cohesion.\n\nIt's clear that the potential reunion of Prince Harry and Meghan with the Royal Family is laden with both anticipation and complexity. The upcoming anniversaries, engagements, and possible meetings signify more than just familial gatherings; they represent pivotal moments for reconciliation and future dynamics within the royal household. The significance of these interactions extends beyond personal relationships, highlighting the impact on public and Royal Family perceptions amidst ongoing global interest in royal affairs.\n\nThe journey of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, marked by their decision to step back from royal duties and their efforts towards fostering understanding and unity, reflects broader themes of resilience, public scrutiny, and the quest for privacy. As they navigate these challenges, the importance of their roles within the broader context of Royal Family dynamics and public perception remains a topic of keen interest and speculation. Their efforts towards reconciliation and the implications of their actions for the unity of the Royal Family underscore the enduring fascination with and significance of royal narratives in today's society.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki",

Harry was expected to take on the role before stepping back from his royal duties in 2020.\n\nIn a fresh snub to Harry, the engagement was announced just hours after it was revealed he would not be seeing his father during his trip to the UK. He's here to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nThe publication also shared claims Harry made multiple attempts to arrange a visit with his father prior to the announcement.\n\nA source claimed: \"Harry is normally 5,000 miles away in California but by happy coincidence on Wednesday they will be just two miles apart. It's clear he is keen to see his father as he continues his recovery. Most people expect another reunion of some kind next week.\"\n\nHowever, this is not to be the case.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex shared: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities. He hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nIt comes after a source has claimed that the Prince and Princess of Wales are \"seething\" with Harry's upcoming tour of Nigeria, especially since his wife, Meghan Markle, isn't present for his whirlwind visit to the UK.\n\nA source told Closer: \"William and Kate are livid that Meghan and Harry are taking on this Africa tour and acting like they're royals again.\n\n\"In their eyes, they're just picking and choosing what suits them and benefits their bank balance and image. Their latest 'royal roadshow' has left them both seething.\"\n\nRoyal commentator Charlotte Griffiths previously told GB News why she believed Meghan would miss the UK trip.\n\nShe explained: \"If Meghan was to come to the UK, it would be really difficult. It would bring up terrible memories of the past for her.

Meghan Markle's decision not to fly to the UK next week has reportedly left Prince Harry feeling conflicted between his wife and his return to Britain.\n\nIt has been reported that Meghan is not flying back with him over security reasons, but sources claim Harry also understands how it would be difficult for her to return to England and reunite with his family after more than 18 months.\n\nThe 39-year-old prince is due to arrive alone on May 8 for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, but it was originally believed he would be joined by Meghan and their kids, in part to show their support for King Charles and Kate Middleton, who are both undergoing cancer treatment and to attend a ceremony to mark 10 years of the Invictus Games.\n\nBut a return to Britain might understandably be difficult for Meghan, given her difficult history with the royals - including the fall-out from Harry's revelatory biography, Spare, and the couple's deeply personal interview with Oprah Winfrey back in 2021.\n\nA source told OK!, \"Harry is extremely loyal to Meghan and would never want to put her in an awkward position, and he understands why she would find it difficult to return to Britain - too much has happened to make her feel comfortable.\"\n\nHarry is keen to put the past behind him and extend an olive branch, claims the source. \"He wants to see his father at this difficult time, and offer support to Charles and Kate, who he was once very close to.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan are believed to have \"reached out\" to Kate, 42, and Prince William after the Princess of Wales' released her emotional video announcing her cancer treatment in March. The gesture was seen as a peace offering between the two couples - with relations with William, 41, thought to be particularly strained.\n\nOur source added, \"In an ideal world, they would still be close to the royals and get support from them, but too much has happened, and they are both just sad that it's all turned out like this.\n\n\"Harry hopes that it can all be sorted out one day. He would never want to be in the position where he would have to choose between his wife and his family.\"\n\nThere have been some strong signs recently of attempts to repair things, particularly between Harry and his dad, King Charles. When Charles, 75, announced in February that he had cancer, his youngest son flew from his California home to meet him face-to-face in London. Meanwhile, Meghan hasn't stepped foot in the UK since Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth III, died in September 2022.\n\nOur source said that Meghan was initially excited to have a bigger family when she married Harry, but later felt they had no option but to \"walk away\" when relations began to \"sour\".\n\n\"They were determined to get their side of the story across and knew of the ramifications of that,\" they claimed. \"But Harry has had a bit of wake-up call in recent months, with the news of both his dad's and Kate's cancer, and it has made him realise that life is fragile.\"\n\nIt was initially widely reported that Meghan would join Harry next week, and would bring their two young children - Prince Archie, who turned five on May 6, and Princess Lilibet, two, - for the Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral But the former Suits actress made a \"dramatic U-turn\", reportedly fearing for her family's safety after the exact date and time of the service was leaked.\n\nHowever, she has been confirmed - by a national Royal Correspondent - as Harry's plus-one for his trip to Nigeria, which immediately follows the Invictus Games ceremony in the UK. The source said her decision to accompany Harry to West Africa proved their relationship was still \"strong\".\n\n\"She has vowed to support him and while she won't be in the UK, she will be by his side in Nigeria and proving how strong they are as a couple and also what the royal family are missing out on,\" the source said. \"She says they don't have to do everything together and it's important for them to have separate interests. Like any couple, they need time apart.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry have both been incredibly vocal about the way they feel they're treated in the UK. Harry's shock statement released by Kensington Palace back in 2016, when they were boyfriend and girlfriend, referred to the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" aimed at Meghan, and said: \"He knows commentators will say this is \"the price she has to pay\" and that \"this is all part of the game\". He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his.\"\n\nThen in his Netflix docuseries, titled Harry and Meghan, he discussed his family's reaction, saying: \"What people need to understand is, as far as a lot of the family were concerned, everything that she was being put through, they'd been put through as well, so it was almost like a 'rite of passage'.\"\n\nAccording to our source, Meghan is stuck between a rock and a hard place but will likely stand firm in her decision not to step foot on UK soil. \"Meghan couldn't win either way - if she went to the UK with him, she would be accused of interfering. This is just something Harry has to do for himself. There has always been a lot of drama surrounding their marriage - but this has only made them stronger.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitya_underwood@ok.co.uk", "name": "Mitya Underwood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suits (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32730148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SOCIAL_HMjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 582, "textEnd": 587}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 3273, "textEnd": 3278}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He's already touched down in London, England, ahead of a special service on May 8, 2024. There won't be the Duke of Sussex's wife, Meghan Markle, or any other British royals along to mark the occasion. This, an expert says, will be a \"telling\" reflection of what he's \"done.\"\n\nOn May 8, 2024, Harry's heading to St. Paul's Cathedral, the same place where his parents, King Charles III and Princess Diana, married in 1981. There he'll take part in a service of thanksgiving all about the Invictus Games.\n\nWhile he's already in London attending anniversary events, Harry won't have any family on hand at the church service, which, per royal expert Jennie Bond, is \"telling.\"\n\n\"He's here to celebrate the Invictus Game, and rightly so, it is a great achievement,\" the former BBC commentator said (via Express). \"But how telling it will be to see him there without a single member of the royal family present to salute his achievement.\"\n\n\"It will be a graphic illustration of what he has done to the family he still professes to love,\" she continued, saying \"part of him\" likely has \"regrets\" about how things have played out between him and the rest of the royal family.\n\n\"There must be a part of him now that profoundly regrets the rift he and Meghan have caused,\" she said. \"He has no one else to blame.\"\n\nFollowing the Invictus Games anniversary service, Harry will be reunited with his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, when they make a joint trip to Nigeria.\n\nIt seems King Charles is prepared to be \"friendly and supportive\" to his youngest son, but only on a personal level. That reason, a former courtier told The Daily Beast, is part of the reason why no senior royals are going to the Invictus Games anniversary service.\n\n\"Charles has made it quite clear he is ready to be friendly and supportive to Harry in his capacity as a private person, as his dad,\" the insider said. \"But he is not going to throw the weight of the institution behind Invictus again.\"\n\n\"This all seems very logical inside the Palace bubble,\" they continued. \"But the trouble is that people who don't particularly care about such things, who are dimly aware that the royals spend their days visiting community centres [sic] and opening supermarkets, are going to wonder why they are boycotting this terrific charity that is headed by the king's son.\"\n\n\"Many of us think this is a classic example of the royals cutting off their nose to spite their face. Because Invictus is clearly exactly the kind of organisation [sic] the royal family should be supporting.\"\n\nThe family, they concluded, is missing an opportunity to \"bridge\" the divide. \"If a bridge is ever going to be built, Invictus is the bridgehead to build it from. And they should get on and do it.\"\n\nA father and son reunion isn't happening for Harry and King Charles. A spokesperson for the 39-year-old confirmed as much following weeks of speculation about a potential get-together.\n\nAs some reports have claimed it seems King Charles will be too busy to meet Harry while he's in town. \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesperson said (via BBC).\n\nThe king returned to public duties on April 29, 2024, after approximately 11 weeks due to cancer treatment. He has a weekly meeting with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and a Buckingham Palace garden party scheduled.\n\nHarry, the spokesperson added, is \"understanding\" of his father's busy schedule. \"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\" Harry, they added, \"hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThe last time Harry saw his King Charles was in February 2024.

He arrived at the Abbey alongside Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice and their husbands, Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, but was not seen interacting with either Charles or his estranged older brother Prince William.\n\nHowever, a royal author has pointed out a significant gesture made by Harry towards the King as he left the Abbey following his crowning. In his book 'Charles III: New King, New Court', Robert Hardman writes: \"As the National Anthem reaches the end of the first verse, the King is alongside the royal pews where the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh, both in the front row, plunge into floor-scraping curtseys. All the men bow, including the Duke of Sussex in row three. Indeed, tellingly, he drops his head for longer than most. \".\n\nThis week, Prince Harry is set to return to the UK for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The service of thanksgiving will take place at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Wednesday, May 8.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is expected to deliver a reading at the event, which celebrates a decade since the inaugural Invictus Games in London in 2014. The games were founded as a sporting event for injured and sick military personnel and veterans, reports the Mirror.\n\nThis will be Harry's first visit back to the UK since he visited King Charles following his cancer diagnosis in February, and it marks his first major event attendance in Britain for some time.\n\nWhile event organisers have not confirmed the attendance of any other royals, it has been confirmed that Meghan Markle will not be accompanying her husband. The service falls just two days after their son Archie's fifth birthday.\n\nFollowing the London event, Harry and Meghan are set to travel to Nigeria, having been invited by the West African country's chief of defence staff, who met the Duke at the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf last September.\n\nThe Invictus Games was established as a sporting event for injured and sick military personnel and veterans. During their visit to Nigeria, the royal couple will meet with service members and their families and participate in traditional cultural activities, according to Nigerian media.\n\nFurther details about the visit have yet to be disclosed.\n\nDefence Headquarters expressed their delight and honour, as reported by local newspapers, following the acceptance of their invitation by Harry and Meghan, who has Nigerian roots. This will mark their inaugural visit to Nigeria as a couple.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

London", "body": "It will be a very lonely Prince Harry who will arrive at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games tournament that he founded a decade ago.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to 2014 when, accompanied by his father and step-mother - now King Charles and Queen Camilla - and his brother Prince William, Harry launched the very first Invictus for injured and sick military personnel and veterans.\n\nSince then, the tournament has been held in cities across the world from Sydney to Toronto to D\u00fcsseldorf and grown in size to include hundreds more competitors from many more countries.\n\nIt's been an undoubted success and I've witnessed first-hand how it's turned around the lives of many military veterans who carry both physical and mental scars from the combat operations they've been in.\n\nSome have even shared with us how they might no be here today if it had not been for Invictus.\n\nCompetitors past and present will be at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, along with the actor Damien Lewis.\n\nBut this event will be just as notable for who isn't here, rather than simply who is.\n\nShe has decided to steer clear of the UK and will not attend the service of thanksgiving at all.\n\nIt's not that she is reluctant to travel as a mum of two young children because she is joining Harry for a joint visit to Nigeria later this week.\n\nIn fact, she may well have to pass through the UK to meet up with Harry and start the Nigeria trip together.\n\nBut given everything that she and Harry have said about his family - on Netflix, to Oprah Winfrey and in his book Spare - she has decided not to make any public appearances in the UK.\n\nThe last time Harry and Meghan were together at St Paul's, in 2022 for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee, they were both cheered and booed when they arrived.\n\nBut in a few days' time, in Nigeria, the Duke and Duchess will land in the Nigerian capital Abuja after having been invited by the government.\n\nMeghan recently revealed she has Nigerian ancestry.\n\nIn fact, she said on one of her podcasts that a test she took showed she was 43% Nigerian.\n\nSo, later this week, both Harry and Meghan are likely to be given a huge welcome in Nigeria -a Commonwealth country that even the King has been unable to visit since he became Monarch.\n\nThe other significant absentees at St Paul's on Wednesday are members of Harry's family.\n\nTen years ago, at the very first Invictus Games, the Royal Family attended the events and helped Harry to launch his project that was still in its infancy.\n\nBut the non-attendance of any Royals isn't really a surprise given everything that has happened in the last few years.\n\nWhat was more of a surprise this week, was the statement from Harry's office telling the world that his father is too busy to meet him.\n\nThe carefully worded statement stated that Harry is \"understanding of his father's diary of commitments\" but it simultaneously revealed that, even at a time when the King is being treated for cancer, he and Harry can't see each other during his short stay in the UK.\n\nBuckingham Palace has refused to engage with any questions about Harry's statement.\n\nNor will Harry see his brother, Prince William, and sister-in-law, Kate, even though she revealed her own cancer diagnosis before Easter.\n\nNot for the first time, a visit by the Duke of Sussex to his country of birth, is laying bare the depth of the rift between him and his family.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV

The first edition of the games took place in London in 2014 and was attended by the likes of King Charles and Prince William.\n\nHowever, when Harry appears for the event at St Paul's tomorrow, it appears that he will be solo. Wife Meghan Markle is not joining him in London, and it seems none of his royal relatives will be in attendance at the event.\n\nHarry won't be at St Paul's tomorrow with Meghan Markle\n\nAnd according to former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, Harry may come to regret the frosty relations between him and his family overshadow one of his biggest achievements. She told OK!: \"Harry is not a bad person. He was always the most popular of the young royals and was fun, modern and warm.\n\n\"There must be a part of him now that profoundly regrets the rift he and Meghan have caused... he has no one else to blame. The path to making things right again is a rocky one, or, indeed, a near impossible one when it comes to William and Catherine.\n\n\"He's here to celebrate the Invictus Games... and rightly so, it is a great achievement. But how telling it will be to see him there without a single member of the royal family present to salute his achievement. It will be a graphic illustration of what he has done to the family he still professes to love.\"\n\nWhile in London, Harry will not meet with his father King Charles, with the pair both scheduled to be in London together on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThere will also be no reunion between feuding brothers Harry and William as their relationship continues to be frosty. A source said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry is expected to be in the UK until Thursday when he will meet up with Meghan in Nigeria, where the couple are invited to take part in cultural activities. They are expected to meet military staff during the trip, which is linked to the Invictus Games. It is their first trip to the African nation, which holds a special place in Meghan's heart having revealed last year she is \"43 per cent \u00adNigerian\".", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_Bond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennie Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32738581.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_2023-Invictus-Games-Dsseldorf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He already did a public event with seemingly limited press availability. The event was for the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, and it was basically a panel discussion with some of the British Invictus organization people. That alone caused a huge commotion in the British media, but then something else happened once Harry was on British soil: his spokesperson confirmed, in a simple statement, that Harry will not see his father on this visit \"due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\" The way Harry maneuvered this situation was brilliant - simply acknowledging that there had been some communication and that Charles refused to meet him because Charles had scheduled busy-work specifically to coincide with Harry's visit. Harry put the onus on Charles, the same dogsh-t father who has been openly briefing the media about a potential meeting with Harry for the past week. Well, the palace is scrambling. And they seemingly contacted Richard Kay at the Daily Mail to do some clean-up:\n\nPrince Harry's arrival in Britain had triggered speculation that father and son would meet. Some had even boldly suggested that such a meeting might, at long last, start a process of reconciliation between the King and Harry. Indeed, there was even murmur of an olive branch being extended. Instead, the hand-wringing excuses of 'full diaries' offers a different and, for Harry, a more ominous message. Unlike that dramatic flying visit in February, where the Prince was granted a less than 30-minute meeting just after Charles's cancer diagnosis had been made public, the palace gates remained firmly closed.\n\nPointedly, it was the Duke of Sussex's team that broke cover with a spokesman explaining that a meeting 'unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme'. Even with the acknowledgement that Harry recognised his father's 'commitments and various other priorities', the nuance in the bulletin was clear: the failure to meet was not Harry's fault. So much for olive branches.\n\nWhat then is going on, and what do events tell us about the state of relations between the exiled Harry, his father and the rest of the Royal Family? One conclusion would suggest that, far from his hope of reuniting with his father in the wake of the King's cancer diagnosis, the illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement.\n\nBut, in fact, I understand that there had been no formal request from either the King or his son to schedule a meeting. For Harry also had a packed programme. From his overnight flight from Los Angeles, he was whisked to an event for the Invictus Games, his project for wounded and former armed forces personnel, at Armoury House in East London.\n\nAnd today, while the King hosts the first garden party of the year, the Prince will mark the tenth anniversary of the games with a service at St Paul's cathedral. If Harry had been so set on seeing his father, it is tempting to wonder why he didn't fly over a day or two earlier when Charles had no official duties. How significant that might have been if they had been together on the first anniversary of the King's coronation. Inconveniently, that fell on Prince Archie's fifth birthday and Harry chose to spend it with his family in California.\n\nOnce, Harry's return visits to the UK meant it was relatively straightforward for him to drop in on his father, but he no longer has royal accommodation. And, intriguingly, he made no request to stay at any royal residence for this two-night visit.\n\nThis alone suggests that chances of a rapprochement are more remote than ever. Trust too has evaporated in the 16 months since Harry's explosive memoir Spare, with its excoriating attacks on Camilla, \u00adWilliam and Kate.\n\nSome old friends were surprised that given his Christian faith, a King who practises humility and empathy as a matter of course, could find no time to see his son. Others argued that no blame could surely be attached to Charles if he viewed such encounters with his son as more a burden than a pleasure.\n\n[From The Daily Mail]\n\nWow, Buckingham Palace is really trying to massage Harry's statement and they ended up spilling some fascinating tea. \"I understand that there had been no formal request from either the King or his son to schedule a meeting.\" My interpretation of that is that Harry called his father informally and asked if they could schedule something and Charles, forever a whiner, complained about his full schedule. Harry said \"okay, well, I'm busy too\" and left it at that. Charles expected Harry to beg, Charles's staff expected Harry to go through official channels, and Harry called everybody's bluff.\n\n\"If Harry had been so set on seeing his father, it is tempting to wonder why he didn't fly over a day or two earlier when Charles had no official duties.\" If Harry had done so (lol) Charles would have scheduled busy-work to cover that time frame too. Although Charles would have loved it if Harry skipped Archie's birthday for five minutes of Charles's time.\n\n\"Intriguingly, he made no request to stay at any royal residence for this two-night visit.\" The fact that palace courtiers leaked that information to Richard Kay at the Daily Mail tells you exactly why Harry doesn't want the palace to know his itinerary or travel plans.

The younger son of King Charles has only been back in Britain on a few occasions since he and his American wife Meghan stepped down from official royal roles in 2020 and moved to Los Angeles where they live with their two young children.\n\nThey have since become estranged from the rest of the royal family and Harry is said to be barely on speaking terms with his elder brother, heir to the throne Prince William. Harry's last publicised trip came in February when he made a flying visit to see his father for a quick reunion after Buckingham Palace revealed that the 75-year-old king had been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nThere had been press speculation that the pair would meet up again on his latest trip, but a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said this would not happen. \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\" Charles returned to public duties last week for the first time since his diagnosis for an unspecified form of cancer. Buckingham Palace said the king's diary would be carefully managed to minimise any risks to his health.\n\nThe palace has said it would not comment on matters relating to Harry. On Tuesday, Harry, who served in the British armed forces in Afghanistan, attended a number of appointments linked to the Invictus Games. On Wednesday he will appear at a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral in London where he will deliver one of the readings.\n\nAfter leaving Britain, Harry will be joined by his wife Meghan for a visit to Nigeria.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/01_04_2019_19_29_06_9517358.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

ITV's royal editor From Chris Ship confirmed at 1pm this afternoon: \"Prince Harry is in the UK. He landed here ahead of his St Paul's Cathedral service tomorrow to mark 10 years of the @WeAreInvictus which he founded in 2014.

She said: \"There are ways of keeping a low profile and then there is Harry here, back in the UK and looking untroubled by the idea of attracting any attention.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has been spotted in East London\n\nJudi added: \"Instead of slipping into his jacket he seems to go down the matador route here, swirling it through the air while standing with his legs splayed and bent at the knees. This looks like a display that hints at either genuine confidence or a more wary bravado.\"\n\nThis comes as it was reported today that Prince Harry will not meet with his father King Charles during his trip to the UK - but hopes to see him soon. A spokesperson for the Duke said: \"It, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry is scheduled to give a reading during the event on May 8. The service will take place at St Paul's Cathedral, the same place his parents got married. Meghan has turned down her invitation to the event after she was warned by veterans that the Invictus Games 'lost meaning' with her involvement.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32754769.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harryexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 2398, "textEnd": 2403}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Prince William as Colonel-in-Chief of Harry's former regiment the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe event will take place in front of an Apache, the same type of helicopter Harry operated when serving in Afghanistan.\n\nWilliam, who flew with the Air Ambulance during his active service as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot, will also take to the skies in the chopper.\n\nThe update is a double blow for Harry after his father declined to attend the Duke of Sussex's tenth anniversary service for the Invictus Games at St Paul's cathedral on Wednesday morning local time.\n\nAccording to a well-placed source inside the palace, the King's decision to skip Harry's event while RSVP'ing yes to William's event was not a coincidence.\n\n\"Timing is everything,\" the palace insider told The Sun newspaper on Wednesday following the announcement.\n\nThe California-based Duke of Sussex landed back at Heathrow solo on Monday and carried out a number of appointments linked to the Invictus Games on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's service.\n\nA spokesperson for the Sussexes confirmed Harry will not see his father during the visit due to Charles' busy schedule of royal engagements.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\"

repair relations with the monarchy.\n\n\"This will be seen as a snub,\" he told the Mirror newspaper on Tuesday.\n\n\"There is little doubt that this was not arranged as it should have been as King Charles has always made it clear that his door is open to Harry.\"\n\nHarry, 39, was reportedly hoping his American wife and the couple's two children would join him in the UK for the anniversary service at St Paul's cathedral on Wednesday, but Meghan allegedly turned her husband down.\n\nMeghan reportedly declined the invite because she was concerned Harry \"would be made a fool of\" by the

(Harry is due to give a reading at the Service of Thanksgiving.) According to Page Six, Harry had been working for over a month to squeeze in some time in his father's schedule, \"only to be turned down,\" the outlet reports.\n\nHugo Vickers, a well-respected royal historian and a friend of the royal family, told Page Six that \"If the King wanted to see Harry, he would find time very easily,\" he said. \"You can never be too busy to see your son.\"\n\nAs Harry's spokesperson put it in a statement released yesterday, Harry \"is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\" Charles just returned to public-facing duties last week after nearly three months had passed since he announced his diagnosis of cancer on February 5; within 24 hours of the announcement being made public back in February, Harry flew to the U.K. -- a transatlantic trip, roughly an 11-hour flight spanning over 5,000 miles -- where he was given only about 30 minutes with his father. Still, even 30 minutes -- as short as that is -- is more than no time given to Harry during this visit, which marks Harry's first time in London in three months.\n\nVickers said \"It's a good idea if they do meet to forge some kind of reconciliation.\" He suggested that there would be points in the King's diary that he could open up for Harry, including breakfast, though he opted not to do so. \"The King has left the door wide open, but obviously not that wide,\" a different royal source said. \"But they absolutely can stuff things in his diary and juggle things around.\"\n\nLongtime royal photographer Arthur Edwards agreed with Vickers, telling The Sun that the King \"could have found time\" to see Harry: \"It's great triumph that the King is back at work now and back to the grindstone,\" Edwards said. \"Obviously, his time is packed, and there's so many things to catch up on. But I'm sure if he wanted to, he could have found time to see Harry, but obviously doesn't want to, and Harry seems to have accepted it.\"\n\nA source speaking to The Daily Express said \"Harry is, of course, extremely disappointed that he hasn't been granted a meeting with his father this time,\" they said. \"It's even harder to wrap your head around when you consider that the pair will be in the same city, at the same time, and just a stone's throw away from each other.\"\n\nThough Harry is due to meet up with his wife, Meghan Markle, in Nigeria after visiting the U.K., she is not in his native country with him at present. In addition to Harry not getting to see his father (nor will he see his brother, Prince William, who Page Six reports he hasn't spoken to in over a year), there aren't expected to be any senior royals in attendance at Harry's celebration tonight, despite the Invictus Games being some of the landmark work of Harry's life. (The first Games took place in London a decade ago, in 2014.)\n\n\"It's quite a snub,\" former BBC royal correspondent Michael Cole said, per Tatler. \"The prodigal son is not welcome -- not for the present, anyway. In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused. There can be no mistake -- this is a royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne [Harry]. Actions have consequences, but rarely are they played out as starkly as they are here.\"\n\nNot much can be agreed upon in this world -- inside the royal stratosphere, and outside of it -- but no matter where one stands on the merit of Charles declining his son's invitation to meet, one statement is almost universally accepted: it's all just very, very sad.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_burchfield@marieclaire.com", "name": "Rachel Burchfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Vickers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugo Vickers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vickers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transatlantic crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cole_(wrestling)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cole (wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tatler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stratosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ea5QV3sjoUQw8U882WmELS-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-05", "textStart": 1090, "textEnd": 1100}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Ahead of the service, Harry visited Armoury House this afternoon for an Invictus Games discussion called 'Realising a Global Community' hosted by Louise Minchin.\n\nThe Prince had hoped to meet his estranged father the King during his trip, which follows a previous quick visit in February after Charles's cancer diagnosis. Harry's event was just three miles away from where Charles was, at Clarence House.\n\nBut Harry's spokesman said today: 'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n'The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nInstead, as the Duke's foundation Archewell confirmed, he will meet city financier Guy Monson.\n\nReacting to the news, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said: 'This, whatever the logistics, will be widely perceived as a snub.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex will enjoy dinner this evening with Guy Monson, who attended the unveiling of a statue of Princess Diana in 2021 at Kensington Palace (pictured left, at the unveiling)\n\nInvictus Games Foundation chief executive Dominic Reid and Prince Harry at the Honourable Artillery Company in London this afternoon\n\nKing Charles III is pictured holding papers as he arrives at Clarence House in London today\n\n'This is one of the most public rifts in the world.

For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide.\n\n'The Prodigal Son is not welcome - not for the present, anyway. In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused.\n\n'There can be no mistake: this is a royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne. Actions have consequences but rarely are they played out as starkly as they are here.\n\n'Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message and many people will say, ''About time too''.'\n\nFellow royal expert Richard Palmer said: 'It's surprising if the King and Harry are not meeting at all and perhaps a sign of how much bridge-building still needs to be done. There's been much media speculation that father and son would meet. While that always looked like guessing, I'd have guessed they would meet too.'\n\nHarry is understood to have had various Invictus Games commitments today, according to ITV.\n\nMonson, chief investment officer of Sarasin and Partners, a London-based \u00a318billion investment fund, was alongside the warring brothers when they unveiled a statue of their mother Princess Diana in 2021 at Kensington Palace.

The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities,\" adding that Harry \"hopes to see [Charles] soon.\"\n\nThe last time Harry and Charles were together was in February, when Harry rushed back to see his father after the monarch had been diagnosed with cancer and begun treatment. Due to the last-minute nature of the trip back to his home country, Harry only got to see his father for 30 minutes, before the King was obliged to return to Sandringham to rest.\n\nLooking ahead to the Invictus Games event, royal expert Dunlop said: \"After a very fleeting window of opportunity with Charles in the wake of the King's February cancer announcement, Harry told ABC he was 'grateful' for the time he spent with his father. It was a glimmer of hope for a more amicable future and many presumed a further meeting would be forthcoming in the wake of today's Invictus Games anniversary celebration.\n\n\"Instead, the Duke will give a reading in St Paul's Cathedral, the epic venue of his parents' fated wedding, with no significant members of the royal family by his side. It is painfully ironic that Harry is back in London, working for a good cause, in a venue intrinsically associated with the British royal family. Today, every step of the way, he will shadowbox his former life, trapped in the web of monarchy that is apparently impossible to escape, only now he is outside the institution, looking in.\"\n\nThe expert added that while its well known there have been difficult relations between Harry and the rest of the Royal Family since the Duke stepped back in 2020, if the father and son couldn't reconcile now with the fresh perspective brought by Charles's health challenges, when would they be able to do so.\n\n\"Certainly the Sussexes' tell-all publications and broadcasts went well outside acceptable royal and familial lines. But if not redemption now, then when?\" Dunlop asks.\n\nShe also notes that while Harry promotes Invictus at St. Paul's Cathedral, \"the Prince's father will be down the road, blocked by ill health, and what a Sussex spokesperson described as a 'full programme.'\n\n\"Here's hoping the King manages to find time to at least watch his son on television. There he will see that beyond all the mistakes and pain, Harry, in his capacity as Invictus founder and inspiration, continues to change lives for the better. Proof surely that the two men still have much in common?\"\n\nDo you have a story to tell?

and his father, King Charles' health struggles could help reunite the family.\n\n\"Harry would love to reconnect with Kate [Middleton],\" Christopher Andersen, author of \"The King,\" claimed to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"They were once extremely close, and Harry was hit hard by the news of her cancer diagnosis, which he learned about just the way the rest of us did, via Kate's shocking video,\" Andersen claimed.\n\nHowever, it appears Harry's feud with Prince William is still the biggest roadblock in any kind of reconciliation happening.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it doesn't appear [Prince] William is willing to let his brother anywhere near his ailing wife.\n\n\"There was just too much drama between the brothers and their wives, and there is lingering bitterness on everyone's part,\" Andersen continued. \"So, the chances of even a meeting between Harry and the rest of the royal family, much less some sort of reconciliation, seem extremely slim.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it comes after Prince Harry confirmed he won't see his father King Charles during his visit to the UK this week due to the monarch's \"full programme\".\n\nHarry landed in the UK on Tuesday (local time) for a series of events linked to the Invictus Games.\n\nHe is expected to stay for three days before flying to Nigeria where he will be met by his wife Meghan.\n\nA spokesman for Harry has responded to \"speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week\".\n\nThey said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry dashed to the UK in February after the King was diagnosed with an unspecified cancer.\n\nTheir first face-to-face meeting in 16 months lasted 30 minutes.\n\nThe prince flew to the UK alone without Meghan or their children Archie, five, and Lilibet, two, and left 24 hours later.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Andersen", "type": "person",

If it was handled in private without so much press speculation, it would have a better chance of being resolved,\" Fitzwilliams said.\n\nRoyal expert Michael Cole shared the same consensus.\n\n\"It is quite a snub. For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide,\" he said.\n\n\"The Prodigal Son is not welcome - not for the present, anyway. In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused.\n\n\"There can be no mistake: this is a royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne. Actions have consequences but rarely are they played out as starkly as they are here.\n\n\"Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message and many people will say, 'About time too'\".\n\nMr Monson is part of the Invictus Games Foundation, founded by Harry, and was on the organising committee for its first games.\n\nHarry arrived in London solo on Tuesday and is expected to join his wife on a tour of Nigeria later this week after Meghan flies there from the US on her own.\n\nHarry is not expected to meet with his brother Prince William, who will be out of town on Thursday and Friday, or his sister-in-law Kate Middleton, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, while in the UK.\n\nEsther Krakue, a writer and broadcaster, believes that Prince William has no interest in reconciling with Prince Harry.\n\nMs Krakue's comments came after it was speculated the Duke of Sussex had no plans of seeing Prince William during his UK visit.\n\n\"There are reports that Prince Harry has no plans of seeing Prince William and I think that the feeling is mutual,\" Ms Krakue told Sky News host Caroline DI Russo.\n\n\"I suspect actually that Prince Harry might have extended an olive branch, but Prince William and his family are just not interested in it at all.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky

That would take me through the UK or back to the UK, so you know, I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_gibb@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32761527.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harrycharlesexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

However, sources indicate that the King has shown an eagerness to reunite with his son, who has resettled in California.\n\nAn insider revealed last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's second visit to the UK this year, following his February trip to see his father a day after Charles cancer diagnosis was announced, saw him spend just 30 minutes with his dad at Clarence House. This marked a step towards mending their relationship, which took a hit when Harry and Meghan decided to step back from Royal duties in 2020 and relocate to the US.\n\nIn a recent interview on American television, Harry expressed hope that the King's diagnosis could bring about a \"reunifying effect\" within the family. However, a reunion with his estranged elder brother, Prince William, does not appear to be likely.\n\nAn insider revealed: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured.

Harry had made no secret about his hopes to visit his father during this trip to his native country, but according to The Telegraph, \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\"\n\nAfter revealing his cancer diagnosis on February 5, the King returned to public-facing duties just last week, on April 30. To this end, Harry's spokesperson added \"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nTatler reports that among said commitments are the King's weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tomorrow, and the outlet said the monarch might attend the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season. The Telegraph reports that Charles also has a number of other appointments and engagements scheduled for the rest of the week.\n\nRegardless of Charles' busy schedule, this has to be no doubt disappointing for Harry, who is in the U.K. so infrequently. His last visit was back in February, after hopping on a transatlantic flight within hours of the King's cancer diagnosis being made public; father and son were said to have only had about 30 minutes together during that visit. As far back as his infamous Oprah Winfrey interview in 2021, Harry said \"I will always love [Charles]. There's a lot of hurt that's happened. I will continue to make it one of my priorities to heal that relationship.\"\n\nWhile relations have defrosted since that interview over three years ago, familial tensions remain, specifically between Harry and his older brother, Prince William. The brothers aren't expected to see one another during this visit, either, nor is Harry expected to see the Princess of Wales, who announced her own diagnosis of cancer since Harry's last trip to the U.K.\n\nOf Charles and Harry, Hello's royal editor Emily Nash said \"To an outsider it may seem odd that they can't make time for a meeting, but the King is Head of State and has his diary planned months in advance -- so it wasn't a given that it would happen, with Harry only here for a couple of days,\" she said. \"It will inevitably lead to speculation over the state of their relationship, which has come under pressure over the past few years.\"\n\nRoyal expert Richard Palmer said, per The Daily Mail, \"It's surprising if the King and Harry are not meeting at all, and perhaps a sign of how much bridge-building still needs to be done,\" he said. \"There's been much media speculation that father and son would meet. While that always looked like guessing, I'd have guessed they would meet, too.\"\n\nHarry's wife Meghan Markle is not in the U.K. with him, but later this week he will travel to Nigeria, where he will meet up with her for a short tour of the country. The trip is associated with the Invictus Games, which many would call the passion project of Harry's life. Nigeria sent its first team to the Games last year, during the 2023 Games in Dusseldorf last September.\n\nHarry is today carrying out engagements related to the Games ahead of tomorrow's celebration. In a foreword for the celebrations, Harry wrote \"It has been an honor to watch the Invictus Games Foundation grow over the years; what began as a vision to pay tribute to the courage and resilience of wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veterans has flourished into an international organization built on hope, strength, and unity.\"\n\nOf the future of the Games, Harry said while in the U.K., per People, \"Look, I've said this over and over again over the years, every time I've been asked a similar question, which is, 'How long does Invictus go on for?'\" he said. \"And the answer to that is, for as long as it's serving a purpose. I would love more than anything -- and there will be people in this room who go, 'What is he saying?' -- but I would love more than anything to put this in a box, put it on a shelf, and to let that box be covered in dust because we don't need it anymore. But as we in this room probably understand more so than most, that's just simply not the case.\"\n\nHe added \"I'm a big fan of trying to solve the root cause of a problem, and the root cause of the problem is conflict. I can't fix that. So we will always be here to be able to spread the message, tell the stories, change the perspectives and to help as many people as humanly possible because Invictus transcends borders, it transcends politics. It is what it is. There is this magic within this community that exists.\"", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_burchfield@marieclaire.com", "name": "Rachel Burchfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tatler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

claims royal expert", "body": "PRINCE Harry must \"profoundly regret the rift he and Meghan have caused\" and has \"no-else to blame,\" a royal expert has claimed.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 39, will return to the UK tomorrow to attend a ceremony marking the Invictus Games Foundation's 10th Anniversary.\n\nThe star-studded event will be Prince Harry's first time in Britain since his sister-in-law Princess Kate revealed to the world that she's receiving treatment for cancer on March 22.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry, whose wife Meghan Markle and children Archie and Lillibet are expected to remain in the US, last spoke with his father for 30 minutes at Clarence House in February, days after King Charles announced his cancer diagnosis to the world.\n\nAs Harry attends the 10-year anniversary service of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral, Charles, 75, will be just two miles away in London at the year's first Buckingham Palace garden party, which starts from 4pm.\n\nHowever, both events will finish around 6pm, suggesting a possible reunion between the pair.\n\nBut according to royal expert Jennie Bond, Harry is likely to be feeling \"rather contrite,\" adding that his complaints seem very \"trivial\" in light of the cancer battle that both his father and sister-in-law are facing.\n\nSpeaking to OK! magazine about the family rift, Jennie insisted that Harry is not a \"bad person\" and was always \"fun, modern and warm,\" making him at one point, one of the most popular of the young royals.\n\nHowever, she adds: \"There must be a part of him now that profoundly regrets the rift he and Meghan have caused...he has no-one else to blame.\n\n\"The path to making things right again is a rocky one, or, indeed, a near impossible one when it comes to William and Catherine.\"\n\nThe royal expert goes on to point out that while the Duke of Sussex will be making the trip overseas to celebrate the Invictus Games, it'll be very telling to see him there without a single member of the royal family in attendance to celebrate his achievement.\n\n\"It will be a graphic illustration of what he has done to the family he still professes to love,\" she adds.\n\nIt's believed that Prince Harry is \"very keen\" to see his dad while he's back in the UK.\n\nA royal source told The Sun: \"Harry is normally 5,000 miles away in California but by happy coincidence on Wednesday they will be just two miles apart.\n\n\"It's clear he is keen to see his father as he continues his recovery and most people expect another reunion of some kind next week.\"\n\nHowever, the possible meeting is unlikely to include Prince William, who has been the subject of his brother's attacks and has not spoken to him since Queen Elizabeth's funeral.\n\nWilliam will not be in the capital on Thursday, and will be busy with engagements on Friday in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Last week Charles, who is undergoing cancer treatment, returned to public duty by visiting a London cancer centre as well as the Royal Windsor Horse Show. This week, he is expected to have his weekly audience with the Prime Minister and could join a Buckingham Palace garden party tomorrow.\n\nBut it could be that a reunion with his estranged son Harry is also on the cards as they will both happen to be in London tomorrow. The Duke of Sussex is due to attend a service at St Paul's Cathedral tomorrow to mark the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, which he set up for injured servicemen and women.\n\nHarry has had a rocky relationship with his dad, especially since he was highly critical of his royal relatives in his controversial memoir Spare - and and was particularly scathing about his stepmother Queen Camilla. But according to sources, the monarch was keen to see his son, who now lives in California.\n\nA source said last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's trip to the UK is his second to Britain this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his ailing father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House. It marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.\n\nHowever, despite potentially seeing his father, a reunion with his estranged older brother Prince William does not seem to be on the cards. An insider said: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry is travelling to the UK without wife Meghan Markle. He will meet up with her later in the week when the pair embark on a tour of Nigeria, where they are expected to meet with military staff.\n\nThe service at St Paul's is scheduled two days after Harry's son Prince Archie celebrates his fifth birthday. Actor Damian Lewis is set to recite the Invictus poem during the service. Representatives from Invictus Games participating nations, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community, will also be in attendance.\n\nMeanwhile, yesterday, gun salutes celebrated the first anniversary of Charles and Queen Camilla's Coronation, days after Charles returned to public-facing events following his cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun salute in Green Park, next to Buckingham Palace, at noon. An hour later, the Honourable Artillery Company fired 62 volleys from Tower Wharf, next to Tower Bridge.

You have reached into the darkest recesses of their lives when they have literally nowhere else to turn, and you have transformed their existence.\n\n\"Yes, it is about sports, but then again, it's not really. It's about a common humanity. Man's conduct to fellow man - you set the standard for humility, for courage, for determination, the absolute resolve never to quit.\"", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news",

Harry has had a difficult relationship with his wider family since he and his wife, Meghan, stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States in 2020.\n\nHe is also not expected to meet his brother, Prince William, during the visit.\n\nHarry, 39, does not appear to have been accompanied by the Duchess of Sussex for his visit to the UK. Their son, Prince Archie, turned five on Monday.\n\nThe last time the duke was back in his home country was in February on a fleeting visit after his father's cancer diagnosis was announced.\n\nCharles is continuing with treatment for an undisclosed cancer but he returned to public duties last week after his doctors said they were \"very encouraged\" by his progress.\n\nThe past few months have been a tumultuous period for Britain's royal family. Harry's sister-in-law, Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed her own cancer battle in March and has asked for privacy while she undergoes treatment.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex will attend a service of thanksgiving at London's St. Paul's Cathedral later Wednesday celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games and its foundation.\n\nThe inaugural Invictus Games, an international sporting competition for wounded veterans and members of the military, was held in London in 2014.\n\nHarry will deliver a reading while actor Damian Lewis will recite a poem.\n\nFollowing the Invictus celebrations in London, Harry and Meghan will head to Nigeria at the invitation of the Nigerian Defence Headquarters. Nigeria became Africa's first participant in the games last year.\n\nThe next Invictus Games will be held in Vancouver and Whistler in Canada in February 2025. More than 500 competitors from over 20 nations will compete in adaptive sports such as indoor rowing, sitting volleyball, swimming, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball.\n\nLast week, the cities of Birmingham in the UK and Washington, DC in the US were announced as the shortlist to host the event in 2027.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

The inaugural Invictus Games were held in London that September, and he traveled to the U.K. from his California home to celebrate the milestone anniversary.\n\nReflecting on the past decade of the Invictus Games, the Duke of Sussex was asked if there was a \"magic moment\" from the event that made him \"smile.\"\n\n\"It probably hasn't changed, still, it has to be in the beginning, 2014, in the copper box,\" he replied. \"I was at the DJ decks, trying to choose some of the music and put the lights on and just get people on their feet.\"\n\nPrince Harry shouted out Guy Monson, who \"never left his seat\" at the event.\n\n\"But it was that final game of U.S.A. vs. U.K., and it was just end to end. I think it was wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball. And that, to me, was the highlight because you had 6,000 people who had filled this stadium and were on their feet, every age from 95 to 5, and people were just literally blown away by what they were watching. We had no idea what was going to happen.\"\n\nHarry added, \"I think we've just had a huge amount of fun. I think that I personally have learned so much from the people that I have met. The children, the family, the friends, the individuals themselves, and the amount of respect and admiration I have for all of them just continues to build just year after year after year. And now we have these Invictus One Year to Go events as well because, to be honest with you, we can't wait two years!\"\n\n\"So whoever is going to host the next Games, we're all going to be there one year ahead, and then at the Games themselves,\" he continued. \"So the highlight for me is being in this community with all these people.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

The Duke of Sussex is set to deliver a reading at the cathedral in the heart of London, and Homeland star Damian Lewis will recite the poem \"Invictus.\" The prose by William Ernest Henley is full of meaning for the Invictus Games community, and the competition's motto \"I am\" comes from its final line -- \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\"\n\nHenley is coincidentally commemorated with a memorial bust in the Crypt of St. Paul's, which is where the future King Charles and Princess Diana married in 1981.\n\nThe program is expected to bring together representatives from the Invictus Games' participating nations, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community. Invictus community members, supporters, and beneficiaries will also give readings and participate in the service, which will be led by The Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett, Dean of St Paul's.\n\nNews of Prince Harry's Invictus-focused trip was announced on April 28 and brings him back to the U.K. for the first time in a few months. The Duke of Sussex flew to London in February for a private visit with his father, King Charles, after Buckingham Palace announced the sovereign's cancer diagnosis on Feb. 5. Several days later, he stepped out in Canada with his wife, Meghan Markle, Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025's One Year to Go celebrations, which counted down to the seventh cycle of the games in Canada next year.\n\nRelated: Meghan Markle Won't Join Prince Harry in the U.K. Next Month Before Heading to Nigeria Together\n\nPrince Harry will not meet with King Charles during his trip to the U.K. for the Invictus Games anniversary, PEOPLE confirms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex says, \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nRelated: How Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Are Celebrating Son Prince Archie's 5th Birthday\n\nPrince Harry made his latest visit to the U.K. solo, but he is due to reunite with Meghan, 42, for another significant trip this week.

So there's no picking sides for me!\" he told PEOPLE in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "janine_henni@yahoo.com", "name": "Janine

Last night, Buckingham Palace announced that Prince William and his father would be attending a joint engagement next week, where the heir will be made the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nPrior to Prince Harry's decision to step back from royal life four years ago, it was always thought he would take on the role that would see him take charge of the regiment he was toured Afghanistan with until 2014. The announcement that the King would pass on the role he held for 31 years to his eldest son came just two hours after he said he was too busy to see his youngest son. 'Timing is everything,' one royal insider said, while another said the monarch's decision not to see the Duke of Sussex during whistle stop visit to the UK - despite only being three miles apart - 'will be widely perceived as a snub'.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex flew into London from California yesterday as he marks the tenth anniversary of his Invictus Games yet due to the King's busy schedule was unable to meet his father. Harry's spokesperson confirmed that it was 'unfortunately not possible' for the pair to meet 'due to His Majesty's full programme', as he returns to public duties after undergoing treatment for cancer . Following much speculation over whether the Duke would pop in to visit his father, who he last saw in February following his shocking diagnosis, Harry's spokesperson confirmed there was no time for a reunion.\n\n'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,' he said. 'The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.' Harry had been at the Honourable Artillery Company in London appearing on a stage during a discussion called Realising Global Community. His father was just down the road at Clarence House before holding an audience at nearby Buckingham Palace with the Prime Minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka.\n\nInstead of catching up with his estranged father, the Duke enjoyed dinner with city financier Guy Monson (pictured left) last night. 'This, whatever the logistics, will be widely perceived as a snub,' royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told MailOnline. 'This is one of the most public rifts in the world. If it was handled in private without so much press speculation, it would have a better chance of being resolved.' Echoing the same sentiment, former BBC Royal correspondent Michael Cole added: 'It is quite a snub. For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide.\n\n'The Prodigal Son is not welcome - not for the present, anyway. In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused. There can be no mistake: this is a royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne. Actions have consequences but rarely are they played out as starkly as they are here. 'Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message and many people will say, ''About time too''.'\n\nJust two hours after the revelation that Charles and Harry would not meet Buckingham Palace announced Prince William's new role. A statement read: 'At the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, His Majesty The King will officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales. 'In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, The King was pleased to announce military appointments including that The Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. 'The role was previously held by His Majesty The King, as Prince of Wales, for 31 years.'\n\nDuring the ceremony, Prince William will receive a briefing from the Colonel Commandant Lt-Gen Sir Nicholar Borton before viewing a training session. William, who flew for the Air Ambulance, will also take to the skies, controlling the the Apache for a flight. Today Prince Harry will give a reading at a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral - marking a decade since the inaugural competition in London in 2014. Organisers had said there was no confirmation of any other royals attending, or if Harry's wife Meghan Markle or children Archie and Lilibet would also be in the UK.\n\nBut Harry arrived in London by himself today, and is expected to join the Duchess on a tour to Nigeria later this week with Meghan set to fly there from the US by herself. And Harry is not anticipated to see his brother Prince William, who is scheduled to be away from the capital on Thursday and Friday, or his sister-in-law Kate Middleton whose cancer treatment continues following her revealing the diagnosis in March.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

But the Duke's five-word response hints at ongoing optimism.\n\nPrince Harry arrived in the UK earlier on Tuesday and was seen fulfilling duties for the Invictus Games. The celebration marking a decade of the project will be held in St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday.\n\nLast week, insider reports suggested that King Charles was eager to meet his son, provided his calendar permitted it. However, Harrys team have since confirmed that the meeting wont occur.\n\nHis spokesperson stated: \"It, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\"\n\nDespite the setback, there's a glimmer of hope from Harry. The latter part of the statement indicated that the duke \"hopes to see him [Charles] soon,\" suggesting he's still keen on reconnecting with his father, reports the Mirror.\n\nThe last occasion that the two were together followed Charles' cancer diagnosis announcement. Harry promptly returned to his homeland to visit his father.\n\nHe saw his dad for barely half an hour before Charles headed back to Sandringham for some rest, having commenced outpatient treatment for his illness.\n\nCharles has recently been given the all-clear by his medical team to resume some public duties, following a period of working behind closed doors on state affairs - a situation that his nephew Peter Phillips noted left the King \"frustrated\".\n\nAlthough Charles's schedule will \"remain subject to doctors' advice\" and he isn't expected to be fully operational over the summer, his doctors are \"sufficiently pleased\" with his recovery to allow him to return to official engagements. He began last week with a visit to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre and a trip to the Royal Windsor Horse Show - one of the late Queen Elizabeth's favourite events.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nInsiders told the Mirror that if the King's schedule permitted, Harry and Charles planned to meet while the Duke was in the UK. The source said: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is visiting the UK alone, just a day after his son Archie's sixth birthday, and is reportedly set to attend the anniversary service marking 10 years of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral without any other senior royals.\n\nSimilarly, it is reported that Harry didn't make contact with his older brother, William, before his visit. \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time,\" shared a close source.\n\nLater in the week, Harry plans to rendezvous with Meghan for their tour of Nigeria where they are set to engage with military personnel.\n\nIn the Invictus Games service at St Paul's, actor Damian Lewis will deliver a poem reading. Delegates from participant nations of the Invictus Games, consisting of members from the wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veteran community, will also partake.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The prince previously returned to his home country back in February after learning of his father's cancer diagnosis. Now, Harry is heading back for an Invictus Games ceremony at St. Paul's Cathedral, though Meghan Markle will not be joining him. Despite that people were hoping the duchess would attend, it does at least give Harry a chance to spend time with King Charles -- if the king has time to see him, that is.\n\nHarry and Charles haven't seen each other in several months, but Harry did say back in February that he is \"grateful\" for the time he gets with his family and that he loves them. Tensions were quite high between Harry and Charles when Harry left the royal family back in 2020, but things have become more peaceful now between the men. Still, Charles reportedly had four words for the prince when Harry asked about meeting up with his father this week.\n\nAccording to Express, a source close to the king said that Charles said he will only meet up with Harry \"if he is able\" -- those four words suggest that it's not a top priority for the king. Harry did fly hours across the Atlantic back in February to see his father, so it's hard to imagine Charles wouldn't make the time for him. However, it remains unknown whether the two men will actually sit down and hash things out.\n\nPerhaps there is no reason to has things out -- at this point, we don't know what Charles and Harry talk about when they do communicate, and it's possible they respect each other's differences and spend time together to simply catch up and keep a relationship. For all we know, their \"peace talks\" might be a thing of the past.\n\nAlthough it seems likely that Harry will sit down with Charles, it's hard to know if the same can be said for Harry and William. Tensions seem to have only risen since Harry removed himself from the royal family, though it's hard to say what goes on behind closed doors.\n\nAs of right now, it seems unlikely that Harry and William will get together. William has a lot on his plate between attending royal engagements and helping care for Kate Middleton, though Harry might want to at least check in on the Princess of Wales to see how she is doing.\n\nIt seems Harry and William are long way away from settling their differences, but if they can find any common ground in the royal family's recent health struggles, then it could be enough to get them back on good terms.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_mullaney@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Julia Mullaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Charles-Prince-Harry-1.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 47, "textEnd": 52}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

That news was greeted with an avalanche of royal commentary about how Harry needs to see his father, how King Charles demands to see his Sussex grandchildren, how the palace has \"noted\" Meghan's absence and her lack of support for a cancer-stricken king. The message, over and over, was: Harry better beg Charles for a meeting. Then Harry ruined all of that commentary yesterday, upon his arrival in London, with his spokesperson issuing a direct statement saying the king's schedule is too full to meet Harry and Harry understands. Well, Buckingham Palace has decided to counter with: Charles is scheduled to see William next week, and Harry is being snubbed on purpose! Y'all.\n\nBuckingham Palace has announced a joint engagement between the King and Prince William next week after it emerged Charles will not see his other son Harry during the Duke's UK visit. Prince Harry met a millionaire financier this evening after admitting King Charles was too busy to meet him in what experts said was a 'snub' that reflected the depth of their rift. Yet now the Palace has announced King Charles will meet with one of his sons - William - on Monday to hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to the Prince of Wales.\n\nBuckingham Palace announced today: 'At the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, His Majesty The King will officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales. In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, The King was pleased to announce military appointments including that The Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. The role was previously held by His Majesty The King, as Prince of Wales, for 31 years.'\n\nThe announcement that the King would pass on the role he held for 31 years to his eldest son came just two hours after he said he was too busy to see his youngest son.\n\n'Timing is everything,' one royal insider said, while another said the monarch's decision not to see the Duke of Sussex during whistle stop visit to the UK - despite only being three miles apart - 'will be widely perceived as a snub'.\n\n'This, whatever the logistics, will be widely perceived as a snub,' royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told MailOnline. 'This is one of the most public rifts in the world. If it was handled in private without so much press speculation, it would have a better chance of being resolved.'\n\nEchoing the same sentiment, former BBC Royal correspondent Michael Cole added: 'It is quite a snub. For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide. The Prodigal Son is not welcome - not for the present, anyway. In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused. There can be no mistake: this is a royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne. Actions have consequences but rarely are they played out as starkly as they are here.\n\n'Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message and many people will say, \"About time too\".'\n\n[From The Daily Mail]\n\n\"Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message\" - in fact, it was Harry's spokesperson who announced the lack of meeting because Harry knows exactly who his father is and what kind of dumbf-k games Charles is playing. The message is: Charles wants to clout-chase Harry but Charles also wants to blame Harry for not meeting, not bringing the kids over, etc. Harry killed that narrative so the palace and the rota are scrambling. The fact that Charles had to announce this dumbass \"handover\" event with William just hours after the Sussex statement is giving Panic At The Palace.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Highness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Highness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAC_Middle_Wallop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AAC Middle Wallop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Wallop", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Wallop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middle Wallop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MailOnline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Cavalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Household Cavalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

But, she wasn't sure how a meeting between the pair could happen in the short time Harry is in the country.\n\nAngela then went on to say that the ending of the Invictus Games ceremony will clash with the ending of the first garden party of the year. The King is expected to be in attendance.\n\nAngela went on to say that the King will be \"exhausted\" after the garden party. He also has a meeting with the Prime Minister shortly afterward.\n\n\"I also know that Queen Camilla will not let Harry talk alone to his father,\" Angela then claimed.\n\n\"She was there last time. He can't be trusted and I think King Charles is vulnerable. He might say something about his health which you can absolutely bet will go around everybody because it'll make Harry a lot of money,\" she then said.\n\nShe then said that she believes Harry is still in a place \"full of resentment\".\n\nED! has contacted Buckingham Palace and the Sussexes' reps for comment.\n\nHowever, a source told The Sun last week that Harry is \"keen\" to meet with his father.\n\nIt'll be the first time that they've met in person since February when Charles announced his cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"Harry is normally 5,000 miles away in California but by happy coincidence, on Wednesday they will be just two miles apart,\" the source said.\n\n\"It's clear he is keen to see his father as he continues his recovery and most people expect another reunion of some kind next week,\" they then added.\n\nHowever, it isn't expected that Prince William will be in attendance if and when Harry meets with his father.\n\nAccording to The Sun, William isn't in the capital this week.

But the news will have come as a crushing blow to the prince, who told US television in February he hoped Charles's illness could 'reunify' the Royal Family.\n\nHis spokesman said: 'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nSome interpreted the use of the words 'various other priorities' as a thinly-veiled attack on King Charles as prioritising his work over their relationship.\n\nPrince Harry at the Honourable Artillery Company in London\n\nKing Charles III leaving Windsor Castle as he heads to Clarence House\n\nBut if it was, the palace did not react. Indeed, royal aides have repeatedly declined to comment on anything to do with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for fearing of triggering yet another war of words across the Atlantic.\n\nHowever, just hours after Harry's statement, palace officials blithely announced a new joint engagement for Charles and his eldest son William.\n\nIt is one of dozens of official engagements being planned for the 75-year-old monarch in the coming months after his doctors gave him the all-clear to undertake more public work once again while continuing his cancer treatment.\n\nWhile Harry was just three miles - or a 25-minute drive away - on an engagement in east London yesterday, Charles met the prime minister of the Republic of Fiji at Buckingham Palace, before retiring to Clarence House.\n\nToday he again has meetings at Buckingham Palace in the morning before attending the first royal garden party of the season in the afternoon, followed by his weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and a Privy Council meeting well into the evening.\n\nTomorrow he is expected at an as-yet unannounced engagement outside London. It is not believed that Harry was encouraged to put out a statement himself because there is little in the way of communications between the palace and his people.\n\nPrince Harry onstage at an Invictus Games event\n\nBut it no doubt became clear the continued speculation about family relations would continue to overshadow the work he has come here to do.\n\nThe 39-year-old prince, who remains fifth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties and the UK, is in London for several days for engagements centred around the Paralympic-style Invictus Games, which he founded in 2014 for injured service personnel.\n\nYesterday he attended an event to mark the legacy of the games and today will give a reading at a St Paul's Cathedral service to mark the event's tenth anniversary. Media close to the Sussexes had suggested he also 'fervently' wished to see his father while he was here.\n\nHarry has travelled alone, apart from his personal security guards, after claiming he does not feel safe bringing his family to the UK amid a continuing row with the Home Office following its decision to strip him of his round-the-clock Metropolitan Police protection when he left Britain.\n\nHe managed to fly into the country unobserved and his arrival came to light only when media favourable to the Sussexes were tipped off that he was attending a private panel discussion with TV presenter Louise Minchin at the Honourable Artillery Company.\n\nHe was said by sources to have had further sessions in the afternoon - including meeting business chief Sir Keith Mills, the former Invictus Games chairman - followed by a private dinner.\n\nIt has not been confirmed whether he came in on a scheduled, commercial flight, or flew by private jet from his home in California, or indeed where he is staying.\n\nHowever it is not believed to be in a royal residence. Harry has as no official home in the country after being asked to leave Frogmore, his and Meghan's Windsor home.\n\nHe is understood to have been staying in hotels or with friends during his occasional visits.\n\nAccording to reports, he plans to remain in the UK until tomorrow before flying to Nigeria where he will meet up with his wife for a quasi-royal tour, ostensibly to highlight the Invictus Games as well.\n\nThere are no plans for him to meet his estranged brother, Prince William, who is focusing on his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales, who is herself undergoing preventative chemotherapy for cancer and is recovering from serious abdominal surgery in January. William is also due to undertake an investiture today and tomorrow will fly to Cornwall for further official engagements.\n\nHarry had not seen his father in person for 17 months before insisting he would fly to London in February after news of his cancer diagnosis was publicly announced.\n\nThe King, who had been in London and undergoing treatment for his undisclosed form of cancer, was about to leave to recuperate at Sandringham and was able to see him only for around half an hour.\n\nCharles's decision to focus on his health and his work was predicted by the Mail back in November when it was revealed that while the subject of Harry is one that brings him 'great pain', he is determined to put it to one side, for now.\n\nIt is understood there is still widespread family anger at the anguish many believe Harry caused the late Queen in her final years, not to mention the insults heaped on family members including the Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla.\n\nIt was also revealed that Charles was determined to stick to his guns and reject his son's demand for an apology about the way he believes he and Meghan were treated.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Meghan is thought to have remained in Montecito, California, with the couple's two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Royal Family snub Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son Archie on his 5th birthday\n\nMeghan Markle didn't join Prince Harry on his UK trip\n\nPublic relations guru Lynn Carratt has now told The Mirror that the Invictus Games, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary after Harry co-founded the games in 2014, is one of the Duke's \"greatest achievements\". She also touched on how this all happened before Harry met Meghan.\n\n\"However, it was at these games that they first went public as a couple, making it an event close to Meghan's heart as well,\" Lynn added.\n\nShe then revealed the reason why she believes Meghan didn't come to the UK with her husband for the event, with Lynn telling The Mirror: \"Meghan likely didn't want to take the spotlight away from Harry on this important occasion, and she knew that her presence could attract all the attention and she knows there is some hostility towards her in the UK.\"\n\nWhen Harry landed in the UK on Tuesday, ITV's royal editor From Chris Ship confirmed: \"Prince Harry is in the UK. He landed here ahead of his St Paul's Cathedral service tomorrow to mark 10 years of the @WeAreInvictus which he founded in 2014.

The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\"\n\nDespite the fresh blow, there was one sign Harry remains hopeful. The second part of the statement noted that the duke \"hopes to see him [Charles] soon,\" hinting that the door is still open for the King.\n\nThe last time the pair were together was shortly after Charles' cancer diagnosis had been announced when Harry rushed back to his home country to see his father in person. The duke only saw his father for 30 minutes before Charles returned to Sandringham to get some rest, having begun his cancer treatment as an outpatient.\n\nCharles has recently been cleared by his doctors to return to some public-facing duties, after a period of being limited to working behind closed doors on business of state - something that his nephew Peter Phillips has noted left the monarch \"frustrated\".\n\nWhile Charles's diary will \"remain subject to doctors' advice\" and the monarch isn't expected to be at full steam when it comes to working over the summer, his medical team are \"sufficiently pleased\" with his progress to allow the King to get back to official engagements. He kicked things off last week with a visit to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre and a trip to the Royal Windsor Horse Show - one of the late Queen Elizabeth's favourite events.\n\nSources told The Mirror that if the King's diary allowed it, Harry and Charles had intended to meet up while the Duke was back in the UK. The insider said: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is visiting the UK solo, just a day after his son Archie's sixth birthday, and will reportedly attend the anniversary service marking 10 years of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral without any of the other senior royals.\n\nEqually, sources have claimed that Harry did not reach out to his elder brother William ahead of his visit. \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time,\" the insider explained.\n\nHarry will meet up with Meghan later in the week when the pair embark on a tour of Nigeria, where they are expected to meet with military staff.\n\nThe Invictus Games service at St Paul's will see actor Damian Lewis recite a poem. Representatives from Invictus Games participating nations, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community, will also be in attendance.\n\nDo you have a story to tell?

And on the face of it, the King was very busy yesterday.\n\nFrom Windsor Castle where he had spent the Bank Holiday, he had an audience with Fiji's prime minister at Buckingham Palace, followed by a meeting with senior military commanders, and then medical appointments connected to his ongoing cancer treatment, the last of which are followed by an \u00adobligation to rest.\n\nToday promises more of the same, including a Palace garden party and his regular weekly sit down with PM Rishi Sunak, who after last week's drubbing for the Tories in the local elections may need more consoling than usual.\n\nWhat there most definitely was no time for amid all this coming and going, was any kind of get together with his younger son. Prince Harry's arrival in Britain had triggered speculation that father and son would meet.\n\nSome had even boldly suggested that such a meeting might, at long last, start a process of reconciliation between the King and Harry. Indeed, there was even murmur of an olive branch being extended.\n\nFar from Harry's hope of reuniting with his father in the wake of the King's cancer diagnosis, the illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement\n\nInstead, the hand-wringing excuses of 'full diaries' offers a different and, for Harry, a more ominous message. Unlike that dramatic flying visit in February, where the Prince was granted a less than 30-minute meeting just after Charles's cancer diagnosis had been made public, the palace gates remained firmly closed.\n\nPointedly, it was the Duke of Sussex's team that broke cover with a spokesman explaining that a meeting 'unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme'.\n\nEven with the acknowledgement that Harry recognised his father's 'commitments and various other priorities', the nuance in the bulletin was clear: the failure to meet was not Harry's fault. So much for olive branches.\n\nPrince Harry's arrival in Britain for The Invictus Games Foundation Conversation had triggered speculation that father and son would meet\n\nWhat then is going on, and what do events tell us about the state of relations between the exiled Harry, his father and the rest of the Royal Family?\n\nOne conclusion would suggest that, far from his hope of reuniting with his father in the wake of the King's cancer diagnosis, the illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement.\n\nBut, in fact, I understand that there had been no formal request from either the King or his son to schedule a meeting. For Harry also had a packed programme. From his overnight flight from Los Angeles, he was whisked to an event for the Invictus Games, his project for wounded and former armed forces personnel, at Armoury House in East London.\n\nAlthough little more then three miles from Buckingham Palace, he might as well have been on a different continent as far as meeting his family was concerned.\n\nCharles met with Fijian PM Sitiveni Rabuka yesterday while Harry arrived in the UK\n\nAnd today, while the King hosts the first garden party of the year, the Prince will mark the tenth anniversary of the games with a service at St Paul's cathedral. If Harry had been so set on seeing his father, it is tempting to wonder why he didn't fly over a day or two earlier when Charles had no official duties. How significant that might have been if they had been together on the first anniversary of the King's coronation. Inconveniently, that fell on Prince Archie's fifth birthday and Harry chose to spend it with his family in California.\n\nOnce, Harry's return visits to the UK meant it was relatively straightforward for him to drop in on his father, but he no longer has royal accommodation. And, intriguingly, he made no request to stay at any royal residence for this two-night visit.\n\nThis alone suggests that chances of a rapprochement are more remote than ever. Trust too has evaporated in the 16 months since Harry's explosive memoir Spare, with its excoriating attacks on Camilla, \u00adWilliam and Kate.\n\nHarry speaks onstage with Sir Keith Mills to mark ten years since the inaugural Invictus Games in London 2014\n\nThe two men once shared a special bond, but each meeting between them became distracted with the weight of \u00adprevious disappointments.\n\nSome old friends were surprised that given his Christian faith, a King who practises humility and empathy as a matter of course, could find no time to see his son. Others argued that no blame could surely be attached to Charles if he viewed such encounters with his son as more a burden than a pleasure.\n\nWhat is certain is that notwithstanding that busy workload, two figures would have viewed the prospect of a meeting between the King and Harry deeply troubling -- Queen Camilla, who was hurt by \u00adHarry's lacerating attacks, and Prince William who will not \u00adforgive his brother for his comments about Kate.\n\nLast month, the historian Tessa Dunlop suggested Harry was in a 'painful place' following the Princess of Wales's cancer diagnosis and William's remarks.\n\n'The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,' says a courtier. 'For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.'\n\nPerhaps the most telling observation on the broken relationship between Harry and the royals came in, not off-the-record briefings yesterday, but publication of a future joint engagement between the King and his son -- the other one.\n\nNext Monday, Charles will, amid a colourful ceremony, formally hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to Prince William.\n\nHarry, of course, enjoyed a distinguished career with the combat aviation arm of the Army, serving with considerable bravery as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. This passing of the baton, however, speaks more eloquently of a united family. Increasingly, it is hard to see Harry ever again fitting in.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But before that, on May 7, he was seen at the Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters for a one-day summit, called the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation: \"Realising A Global Community'\" The international sporting competition was founded by the Prince to highlight servicemen and woman both serving and veterans.\n\nThis trip to the UK is Harry 's last trip since he rushed back home to see the King after his cancer diagnosis. Many thought and hoped the royal family and Harry might reunite during this trip.\n\nThe last time Harry was in the UK was in February 2024 to visit his father King Charles after cancer diagnosis\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty''s full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nAt the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation, body language expert Judi James examined the photos and suggested Harry has \"feelings of isolation\" even though he is showing a happy front at today's event.\n\n\"This is a confident, splayed-leg, knee-bent walk from Harry who, with his chin raised and an eye-smile that suggests some delight at all the royal-looking fuss here, appears more than happy to enjoy a reception that involves some sort of a military parade for him to inspect as well as a warm, bicep-grabbing man hug reception from his hosts,\" she said.\n\nBody language expert Judi suggest the fiddling with his wedding ring signals \"feelings of isolation\"\n\n\"His emotional leakage signals, though, suggest where his thoughts might lie here though and even hint that the jauntiness is prompted by bravado,\" Judi added.\n\n\"As he brings his hands up in a barrier ritual, he is fiddling with his wedding ring with not one but two fingers. This is a self-comfort gesture that would suggest feelings of isolation and a desire for a back-up team from home,\" Judi concluded about the Duke who came back to the UK solo without wife Meghan Markle and children Archie and Lilibet for these events. And now he is not going to see his other family members nor will they be at the celebration tomorrow.\n\nPrince William is not set to be at the celebration tomorrow or see Harry in general, according to sources.

The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nCharles, who recently resumed royal duties amid his cancer treatment, hosted an audience at Buckingham Palace on May 7, receiving the Prime Minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka.\n\nAdditionally, the Palace is preparing to hold its first garden party of the season on May 8, though the attendees from the royal family remain undisclosed.\n\nWhen it was confirmed that the King and his son would not have a reunion during the Duke's stay in the UK, royal fans took to social media to voice their opinions.\n\nOne critic of the monarch expressed disappointment, stating, \"I always thought that people wanted to mend fences when their days were running short. I guess some people want to die estranged and miserable.\"\n\nAnother supporter praised Harry for his maturity, stating, \"Prince Harry is the ADULT in the Royal Family. He lets King Charles, a 75-year-old man, continue to play silly childish tabloid 'SNUB' games. Well done, Prince Harry. You are the TRUE KING of actual global [credentials] and respect.\"\n\nA third person noted, \"Given that the [Royal Family] is providing sanctuary for an alleged rapist, you'd think they would be utilizing the global popularity of H&M to improve their public image instead the self-destruction currently being played out in public.\"\n\nIn an attempt to defend the King's actions, one X user wrote: \"#KingCharles has deftly taken the wind out of his son's sails. The snub is strategic - Harry can't flounce off to Africa BLABBING his mouth off about meeting the King and updating his condition during ANY interviews in Africa.

Sure, there's love there; they just don't like each other, and there's zero trust on Dad's side.\"\n\nThe royal \"snub\" coincided with a recent announcement by Buckingham Palace regarding military leadership.\n\nIn the statement released by the Palace, Charles will hand over Harry's position as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to his older brother, Prince William. The official handover ceremony is slated for May 13 at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop.\n\nThe Palace's statement reads: \"His Majesty The King will officially pass on the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.\"\n\nIt continued: \"In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, the King was pleased to announce military appointments including that the Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. The role was previously held by His Majesty the King, as Prince of Wales, for 31 years.\"\n\nIn reaction to the news of King Charles' snub, royal experts weighed in, with some noting that it shows how bad things have gotten between father and son.\n\nRichard Fitzwilliams said,\" 'This, whatever the logistics, will be widely perceived as a snub.\"\n\nHe suggested handling the situation privately, adding: \"This is one of the most public rifts in the world. If it was handled in private without so much press speculation, it would have a better chance of being resolved.\"\n\nMichael Cole echoed this sentiment, describing it as \"quite a snub.\" He continued: \"For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, indicates the depth of the divide.\"\n\nCole described it as a \"royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne,\" adding: \"Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message and many people will say, \"About time too.\"\n\nWilliam and Kate have been at loggerheads with Harry and Meghan after they were left feeling \"betrayed\" by claims made in Harry's record-breaking memoir \"Spare.\"\n\nHowever, a source speaking to US Weekly revealed that the Prince and Princess of Wales want a \"truce\" and are \"open\" to reconciling with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe source explained that William and Kate are considering mending their broken relationship with Harry and his wife because of their children, as they don't want their feud to be passed on to the next generation.\n\nThe source stated, \"They want a relationship with Meghan and Harry, and they don't want the acrimony to carry over to the next generation.\"\n\nThe insider added that Meghan and Harry

And I know she's up there, fondly keeping an eye on us. She would be a proud mother\", reports the Mirror.\n\nHe went on to say: \"For all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message. Service. My father's first words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday were a pledge of service. It was a pledge to continue to serve.\"\n\nSeveral people took to Twitter following William's speech - with many interpreting it as a clear jab at Harry and Meghan.\n\nOne viewer commented: \"Service Harry. Do you hear that? Not a free ride.\"\n\n\"SERVICE. Something Harry doesn't understand,\" chimed in another.\n\nWhen the Sussexes made the bombshell decision to step back from royal duties, Buckingham Palace issued a statement regarding their departure.\n\nThe Palace's statement declared: \"Following conversations with the Duke, the Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service.\"\n\nHowever, Harry and Meghan were quick to respond with a statement of their own, asserting: \"We can all live a life of service. Service is universal.\"\n\nA year on from the Coronation events, the rift between Prince Harry and the Royal family appears to have deepened.\n\nPrince Harry, who attended the Coronation service but was absent from other festivities, is set to return to London shortly to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nHe is scheduled to be present at a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Wednesday, May 8, where he is expected to give a reading.\n\nWhether he will meet with his father during this visit is uncertain. Their last encounter was brief, lasting only 45 minutes when Harry hurriedly returned to the UK following the announcement of the King's cancer diagnosis in February, spending just one day in Britain.\n\nSources close to the situation have dismissed the possibility of a reunion between Prince William and his younger brother, Prince Harry.

He was also spotted adjusting celebs' ensembles for photos while they embodied the \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" theme with a \"Garden of Time\" dress code.\n\n\"Anyone else keep thinking this is Prince Harry?\" one user wrote via X on Monday, May 6, alongside a clip of the doppelg\u00e4nger helping Queen Latifah.\n\nAnother added, \"I honestly thought for a split second that Prince Harry had got himself a new job holding peoples dresses at the Met Gala.\"\n\nHarry and his wife, Meghan Markle, have yet to make an appearance at the annual event held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Instead of dressing to the nines on Monday, the pair celebrated son Archie's 5th birthday.

Harry was photographed at The IGF Conversation: Realizing a Global Community event on Tuesday, May 7, and spotted alongside Dominic Reid OBE, CEO of the Invictus Games Foundation.\n\nMarkle and their two children are not expected to join the trip overseas, but the couple are set to travel to Nigeria following Harry's visit.

[Harry] would be more than happy,\" the insider shared, noting that Harry invited his family to the Invictus Games.\n\nA separate source noted that Harry is \"very content\" now and \"doesn't have any of those [old] feelings\" regarding his family's ups and downs.\n\n\"He feels that his life has purpose and meaning and that he can bring a lot of good to the world,\" the second insider said.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_hudgins@usmagazine.com", "name": "Ryan Hudgins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg\u00e4nger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doppelg\u00e4nger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Latifah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Latifah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Order of the British Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Prince-Harry-Has-a-Lookalike-at-the-2024-Met-Gala-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 535, "textEnd": 540}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1222, "textEnd": 1227}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-Monarchy campaign group Republic, told Newsweek: \"It's all cosplay and it's all just trying to find ways to make themselves relevant and important.\n\n\"To my mind, and the minds of a lot of ex-services who we have among our members, it's completely inappropriate for them to be dressing up in medals and uniforms they haven't earned. They need to stop using the military as a play thing.\"\n\nTake, for example, Prince Edward who dropped out before ever completing basic training for the Royal Marines. No doubt he had his reasons, but as a working royal he is allowed to wear military uniform during royal events, including the queen's funeral, while Harry who served on the front line is not.\n\nThe reason is because he has been handed eight honorary military titles, including for example Royal Honorary Colonel of the Royal Wessex Yeomanry and The London Guards, because someone needs to hold those titles and he is a working royal.\n\nIn a context where Charles and William have already beaten Harry in the court of public opinion in Britain they are now at risk of exposing their underlying weakness and Harry's strength by picking the wrong battlefield.\n\nOn the other hand, if Charles and William are not taking a swipe at Harry then they could do with offering some kind of on-the-record explanation of why Charles is not meeting his son, and perhaps they might even consider recognizing the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games which exists to support wounded veterans.\n\nThe British Government was represented at a conference marking ten years of the Invictus Games Foundation on Tuesday, where veterans minister Johnny Mercer was in attendance and he may well be back out at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday.\n\nYet the royal family so far have said nothing to support Harry's project, even though it was launched in 2014 while he was a working royal, and the king has found no time to meet his son.\n\nJack Royston is Newsweek's chief royal correspondent based in London.

File Image/Reuters\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, arrived in the United Kingdom on Tuesday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the renowned biennial sporting competition he founded a decade ago. The celebration will take place with a ceremony at London's St. Paul's Cathedral on 8 May (Wednesday), where Harry will give a reading.\n\nThe Duke and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, relocated to the United States in 2020. Since then, Harry, aged 39, has undertaken several brief visits back to the UK, notably attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022 and his father's coronation last year.\n\nHis latest visit was a brief one when he had rushed to see King Charles following his cancer diagnosis in February.\n\nMeghan, however did not accompany Harry to the UK. The ceremony will be Harry's first major event in the UK since his relocation to the US.\n\nWhat are the Invictus Games?\n\nThe Invictus Games, an international multi-sport event inaugurated in 2014, serves as a platform for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women, encompassing both current serving members and veterans. The term 'Invictus,' derived from Latin meaning 'unconquered,' was chosen deliberately to encapsulate the indomitable spirit of these individuals, showcasing what they can achieve post-injury.\n\nHarry, serving as patron of 'The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry', alongside the UK Ministry of Defence and Keith Mills, then-deputy chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, is credited with the founding of the Invictus Games.\n\nSpeaking at the launch in London on 6 March, 2014, Harry said that the Games would \"demonstrate the power of sport to inspire recovery, support rehabilitation and demonstrate life beyond disability\". Harry also averred that the long-term objective of the Games was to ensure that injured troops were not forgotten as Britain's involvement with the War in Afghanistan came to an end.\n\nThe Invictus Games, the games website says, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more than just sport \u00e2\u20ac\" it captures hearts, challenges minds and changes lives\u00e2\u20ac.\n\nWhere did the idea for the Games come about?\n\nIn 2013, Harry's visit to the Warrior Games, a competition organised by the US Department of Defence for wounded servicemen, left a profound impact on him.\n\nHe openly acknowledged that he \"stole\" the idea, recognising the transformative potential of sports in aiding physical, psychological, and social well-being.\n\n\"He saw how the power of sport could help physically, psychologically and socially,\" reads the\u00c2 Invictus Games website. \"His mind was made up. London would host the inaugural Invictus Games, an international sporting event for wounded, injured and sick Service personnel.\"\n\nDetermined to translate this vision into reality, Harry spearheaded the initiative to host the inaugural Invictus Games in London, just one year later. Since then, he has remained actively involved, serving as the patron of the Invictus Games Foundation.\n\nWill the Royal Family join Prince Harry on 8 May?\n\nWhile Harry extended invitations to his family members for the ceremony, it's unlikely that any senior royals will attend due to various reasons, including health concerns. Kate Middleton and King Charles are both battling cancer.\n\nAlso Read: Prince Harry & Meghan Markle's net worth is nearly Rs 500 crore but where the couple stands in front of Prince William & Kate Middleton?\n\nHarry's accommodations during his visit will be in a hotel, as he no longer has a residence in the UK after vacating Frogmore Cottage. The presence of other royal family members, including Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, and Zara Tindall, who are reportedly close to Prince Harry also remains uncertain.\n\nAre the Games still relevant?\n\nDespite the noble intentions behind the Invictus Games, recent reports suggest challenges and criticisms. Around 2,000 ex-servicemen have reportedly left the Games, claiming it has lost its original meaning.\n\nSome have raised concerns about the event becoming overly associated with royalty, while others have cited issues with Meghan Markle's involvement. However, doubts persist about whether Harry will heed such criticism, with suggestions that stepping down could lead to positive public relations outcomes.\n\nWhen are the next Games being held?\n\nWith six editions already gone, the upcoming edition of the Invictus Games is slated to take place in Vancouver and Whistler, Canada, scheduled from 8 February to 16, 2025. This marks the second occasion that Canada has been chosen as the host country for the games, following Toronto's successful hosting in 2017.\n\nWinter sports will debut at these games, further diversifying the range of adaptive sports offered. Moreover, discussions about the possibility of Nigeria hosting future Invictus Games are underway, as Harry and Meghan are set to visit the African nation later this month.\n\nAlso Read: All you need to know about Markle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nigerian ancestry and her trip\n\nBids are actively being pursued for the honor of hosting the 2027 games, with Birmingham in England and Washington DC, both in contention. The decision regarding the successful host city is anticipated to be announced by July end this year.\n\nNational teams of athletes are sent from more than 20 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Poland, Nigeria, Ukraine and Afghanistan.\n\n\"The Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 presented by ATCO and Boeing will bring together over 500 competitors from over 20 nations to compete in adaptive sports, including the new winter sports: Alpine Skiing and Snowboarding, Nordic Skiing and Biathlon, Skeleton, and Wheelchair Curling, in addition to the core Invictus Games sports of indoor rowing, sitting volleyball, swimming, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball.\" the Games' website stated.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

And on the face of it, the King was very busy yesterday.\n\nFrom Windsor Castle where he had spent the Bank Holiday, he had an audience with Fiji's prime minister at Buckingham Palace, followed by a meeting with senior military commanders, and then medical appointments connected to his ongoing cancer treatment, the last of which are followed by an \u00adobligation to rest.\n\nToday promises more of the same, including a Palace garden party and his regular weekly sit down with PM Rishi Sunak, who after last week's drubbing for the Tories in the local elections may need more consoling than usual.\n\nWhat there most definitely was no time for amid all this coming and going, was any kind of get together with his younger son. Prince Harry's arrival in Britain had triggered speculation that father and son would meet.\n\nSome had even boldly suggested that such a meeting might, at long last, start a process of reconciliation between the King and Harry. Indeed, there was even murmur of an olive branch being extended.\n\nFar from Harry's hope of reuniting with his father in the wake of the King's cancer diagnosis, the illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement\n\nInstead, the hand-wringing excuses of 'full diaries' offers a different and, for Harry, a more ominous message. Unlike that dramatic flying visit in February, where the Prince was granted a less than 30-minute meeting just after Charles's cancer diagnosis had been made public, the palace gates remained firmly closed.\n\nPointedly, it was the Duke of Sussex's team that broke cover with a spokesman explaining that a meeting 'unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme'.\n\nEven with the acknowledgement that Harry recognised his father's 'commitments and various other priorities', the nuance in the bulletin was clear: the failure to meet was not Harry's fault. So much for olive branches.\n\nPrince Harry's arrival in Britain for The Invictus Games Foundation Conversation had triggered speculation that father and son would meet\n\nWhat then is going on, and what do events tell us about the state of relations between the exiled Harry, his father and the rest of the Royal Family?\n\nOne conclusion would suggest that, far from his hope of reuniting with his father in the wake of the King's cancer diagnosis, the illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement.\n\nBut, in fact, I understand that there had been no formal request from either the King or his son to schedule a meeting. For Harry also had a packed programme. From his overnight flight from Los Angeles, he was whisked to an event for the Invictus Games, his project for wounded and former armed forces personnel, at Armoury House in East London.\n\nAlthough little more then three miles from Buckingham Palace, he might as well have been on a different continent as far as meeting his family was concerned.\n\nCharles met with Fijian PM Sitiveni Rabuka yesterday while Harry arrived in the UK\n\nAnd today, while the King hosts the first garden party of the year, the Prince will mark the tenth anniversary of the games with a service at St Paul's cathedral. If Harry had been so set on seeing his father, it is tempting to wonder why he didn't fly over a day or two earlier when Charles had no official duties. How significant that might have been if they had been together on the first anniversary of the King's coronation. Inconveniently, that fell on Prince Archie's fifth birthday and Harry chose to spend it with his family in California.\n\nOnce, Harry's return visits to the UK meant it was relatively straightforward for him to drop in on his father, but he no longer has royal accommodation. And, intriguingly, he made no request to stay at any royal residence for this two-night visit.\n\nThis alone suggests that chances of a rapprochement are more remote than ever. Trust too has evaporated in the 16 months since Harry's explosive memoir Spare, with its excoriating attacks on Camilla, \u00adWilliam and Kate.\n\nHarry speaks onstage with Sir Keith Mills to mark ten years since the inaugural Invictus Games in London 2014\n\nThe two men once shared a special bond, but each meeting between them became distracted with the weight of \u00adprevious disappointments.\n\nSome old friends were surprised that given his Christian faith, a King who practises humility and empathy as a matter of course, could find no time to see his son. Others argued that no blame could surely be attached to Charles if he viewed such encounters with his son as more a burden than a pleasure.\n\nEXCLUSIVEREAD NOW: RICHARD KAY: Beatrice's violent, drug-taking ex who claimed that Prince Andrew asked him for $10,000 cash to bail out one of his girlfriends: Troubled playboy Paolo Liuzzo is found dead of suspected overdose in Miami hotel...\n\nFact-box text\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is certain is that notwithstanding that busy workload, two figures would have viewed the prospect of a meeting between the King and Harry deeply troubling -- Queen Camilla, who was hurt by \u00adHarry's lacerating attacks, and Prince William who will not \u00adforgive his brother for his comments about Kate.\n\nLast month, the historian Tessa Dunlop suggested Harry was in a 'painful place' following the Princess of Wales's cancer diagnosis and William's remarks.\n\n'The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,' says a courtier. 'For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.'\n\nPerhaps the most telling observation on the broken relationship between Harry and the royals came in, not off-the-record briefings yesterday, but publication of a future joint engagement between the King and his son -- the other one.\n\nNext Monday, Charles will, amid a colourful ceremony, formally hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to Prince William.\n\nHarry, of course, enjoyed a distinguished career with the combat aviation arm of the Army, serving with considerable bravery as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. This passing of the baton, however, speaks more eloquently of a united family.

Walking with a black folder under his arm, he nervously chuckled as he was asked if he was happy to be home. He dodges the question and says in response: 'Nice to see you.'\n\nIt comes after Harry admitted that his father King Charles was too busy to see him this week.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation about a reunion, his spokesman announced stiffly that a meeting 'will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme'.\n\nHarry tried to put a brave face on the situation, saying he understood his father's position and 'hopes to see him soon'. But the news will have come as a crushing blow to the prince, who told US television in February he hoped Charles's illness could 'reunify' the Royal Family.\n\nA smartly dressed smiling Prince Harry said hello and waved at onlookers as he walked with a black folder under his arm\n\nAsked if he was happy to be home he nervously chuckles and dodges the question as he mutters in response: 'Nice to see you'\n\nWhile Harry was just three miles - or a 25-minute drive away - on an engagement in east London yesterday, Charles met the prime minister of the Republic of Fiji at Buckingham Palace, before retiring to Clarence House.\n\nToday he again has meetings at Buckingham Palace in the morning before attending the first royal garden party of the season in the afternoon, followed by his weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and a Privy Council meeting well into the evening.\n\nHis spokesman said: 'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n'The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nRoyal aides have repeatedly declined to comment on anything to do with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for fearing of triggering yet another war of words across the Atlantic.\n\nHowever, just hours after Harry's statement, palace officials blithely announced a new joint engagement for Charles and his eldest son William.\n\nIt is one of dozens of official engagements being planned for the 75-year-old monarch in the coming months after his doctors gave him the all-clear to undertake more public work once again while continuing his cancer treatment.\n\nKing Charles III leaving Windsor Castle yesterday\n\nPrince Harry at the Honourable Artillery Company in London yesterday\n\nTomorrow he is expected at an as-yet unannounced engagement outside London. It is not believed that Harry was encouraged to put out a statement himself because there is little in the way of communications between the palace and his people.\n\nBut it no doubt became clear the continued speculation about family relations would continue to overshadow the work he has come here to do.\n\nThe 39-year-old prince, who remains fifth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties and the UK, is in London for several days for engagements centred around the Paralympic-style Invictus Games, which he founded in 2014 for injured service personnel.\n\nYesterday he attended an event to mark the legacy of the games and today will give a reading at a St Paul's Cathedral service to mark the event's tenth anniversary. Media close to the Sussexes had suggested he also 'fervently' wished to see his father while he was here.\n\nHarry has travelled alone, apart from his personal security guards, after claiming he does not feel safe bringing his family to the UK amid a continuing row with the Home Office following its decision to strip him of his round-the-clock Metropolitan Police protection when he left Britain.\n\nHe managed to fly into the country unobserved and his arrival came to light only when media favourable to the Sussexes were tipped off that he was attending a private panel discussion with TV presenter Louise Minchin at the Honourable Artillery Company.\n\nPrince Harry onstage at an Invictus Games event yesterday\n\nHe was said by sources to have had further sessions in the afternoon - including meeting business chief Sir Keith Mills, the former Invictus Games chairman - followed by a private dinner.\n\nIt has not been confirmed whether he came in on a scheduled, commercial flight, or flew by private jet from his home in California, or indeed where he is staying.\n\nHowever it is not believed to be in a royal residence. Harry has as no official home in the country after being asked to leave Frogmore, his and Meghan's Windsor home.\n\nHe is understood to have been staying in hotels or with friends during his occasional visits.\n\nAccording to reports, he plans to remain in the UK until tomorrow before flying to Nigeria where he will meet up with his wife for a quasi-royal tour, ostensibly to highlight the Invictus Games as well.\n\nHarry had not seen his father in person for 17 months before insisting he would fly to London in February after news of his cancer diagnosis was publicly announced.\n\nThe King, who had been in London and undergoing treatment for his undisclosed form of cancer, was about to leave to recuperate at Sandringham and was able to see him only for around half an hour.",

While, the King has also announced to attend William's event after skipping out on Harry's Invictus Games.\n\nThere were speculations that the King could give Harry a green light to meet him as the monarch has already returned to public duties while receiving treatment for cancer. However, Harry's spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that this would not be the case as Charles has other important engagements.\n\nHours after Harry's statement, King's snub to Harry, Buckingham Palace announced that on May 13, the King will make a joint appearance with William to officially hand over to him the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps, Harry's old army regiment.\n\nNow, there are speculations and rumours that The Duke of Sussex could retaliate to the King's decision to avoid him during his trip to Nigeria where he would make a joint appearance with his wife Meghan Markle on the invitation of the country's defense chief.\n\nThe timing of the announcement which coincided with the Duke of Sussex's arrival in the UK has raised eyebrows. These developments appeared to be shocking for some royal experts.as Newsweek's chief royal correspondent Jack Royston told Sky News: \"I think it's very disappointing. I also think the monarchy is at risk here of looking a little bit petty.\"\n\nHe added: \"Charles is going to give William an accolade that 100% would have gone to Harry if Harry was still a working member of the royal family.\"\n\n\"Harry served in the Army Air Corps in Afghanistan,\" Royston continued. \"He was co-pilot gunner of an Apache helicopter.

They were able to enjoy a pleasant time without the kids.\n\nNow, during the game's crucial tenth anniversary, there is a ceremony in the United Kingdom on May 8, 2024, and they are both invited to attend, but unfortunately, that will not happen.\n\nIt has been announced that Prince Harry will attend the ceremony without Meghan Markle, but she will join him in Nigeria later in the month. However, the reasons for this have not been stated publicly.\n\nAs reported by Newsweek, Meghan Markle last publicly visited the UK in September 2022 for the late Queen Elizabeth's funeral, and it seems that she will not be returning anytime soon.\n\nChris Ship has confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that Prince Harry arrived in the UK before the Invictus Games ceremony at St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nAs soon as fans heard that Meghan was not returning to the United Kingdom, they supported her on social media. Meghan has a great fan base supporting all her endeavors, such as her newest one, American Riviera Orchard.\n\nThis same fan base seems to understand and agree with her decision not to return to the United Kingdom, yet they still support the Invictus Games in Nigeria.\n\nThen one fan shared that it \"says it all she feels safer in Nigeria.\"\n\nMeghan will travel to Nigeria with Harry on some Invictus Games-related work despite the US-issued travel advisories against traveling there in general.\n\nMeghan and Harry left the United Kingdom because of security concerns after they had stepped down as working royals.

He is due on a visit to Cornwall in southwest England, and the Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWilliam's wife Catherine is also undergoing cancer treatment and has not made any public appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit, he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that\n\nCharles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While it was rumoured that he may visit King Charles and make a move in repairing their fractured relationship, it has since come out that they will not be meeting up, citing Harry's busy schedule as the reason.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with The Mirror, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams insists that this will be seen as a \"snub\", but Harry and Meghan have already made a plan to \"cover\" for this \"setback.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry looks 'wary' on hurried UK trip as King Charles fails to make time to see his son\n\nHarry and Meghan may be using their Nigeria trip as a 'cover' for a 'setback'\n\n\"Meghan has wisely decided that a hostile press and public would prefer her to stay away from the Service at St Paul's to commemorate a decade of Invictus. Their visit to Nigeria is a cover for what is a setback,\" Fitzwilliams told us.\n\nWhile Meghan isn't joining Harry for his UK, she will join him as the two head to Nigeria later this month. During this trip, they are expected to meet with Service members and participate in various cultural activities.\n\nFitzwilliams also added that while Harry and Meghan have a game plan for redemption, that doesn't soften the blow of his father's \"snub.\"\n\n\"This will be seen as a snub. There is little doubt that this was not arranged as it should have been as King Charles has always made it clear that his door is open to Harry,\" he told us.\n\nThe last time Harry and Charles have seen each other was when Charles was diagnosed with cancer and Harry quickly flew out to see him.\n\n\"Their meeting after the King's diagnosis was extremely brief and we do not know how well it went,\" Fitzwilliams explained.\n\nDespite Charles' condition, Fitzwilliams claims he understands the impact of this decision will be significant.\n\nHarry last saw his father Charles when he was diagnosed with cancer\n\nHe explained: \"The King has engagements and duties he needs to perform and has to balance these with treatment for cancer that must be deeply debilitating. The fact that they will not be meeting will, as all things affecting the royal family will, be worldwide news. If the royal rift is ever to be healed it will be when matters are less public and can be considered privately and less stressfully.\"\n\nAs for Harry's brother, Prince William, Fitzwilliams knew the chance of them meeting was even slimmer.\n\n\"There was never a chance of him seeing William, who does not trust him, and with good reason,\" he shared.\n\nWhile there are plenty of obstacles, Fitzwilliams does believe there is a path to redemption for Harry and Meghan.\n\nHe stated: \"If they were to mention the Commonwealth, of which it is a member, in a favourable light in a speech, this would be positive. They trashed the institution, Queen Elizabeth's most important legacy, in their documentary Harry and Meghan. This was not well received as, when they were senior working royals, they were Commonwealth patronages by the late Queen.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "natalie_hunter@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Natalie Hunter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32758574.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mirror-exclusive-lefft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The Duke of Sussex was pictured visiting Armoury House in London this afternoon, Tuesday 7 May, as he attended an Invictus Games discussion called 'Realising a Global Community ', in his first sighting since touching down in the UK.\n\nHarry flew in especially from his home in Montecito, California to celebrate ten years of the Invictus games this week, however it has also been revealed that he won't be meeting with his father during the trip due to their conflicting schedules. Yet even despite missing out on a reunion, the Duke shows no signs of discontent, with one body language expert even revealing that Harry is feeling \"positive and proud.\"\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Betfair Slots, body language expert Darren Stanton reveals: \"Harry appears to be his most confident self during his return to the UK as he prepares for the Invictus Games. His body language suggests he's feeling strong, as we can't see him using self-reassurance gestures - which he often uses when feeling nervous.\n\n\"He is seen holding his head up high, with his shoulders back and displaying a bold grin. He's developed a lot in terms of his inner strength and confidence. It tells us he is feeling very positive and proud about where he is right now. He is in very high spirits.\"\n\nWhile all eyes turn to the Prince and an organisation close to his heart, the Invictus Games, Darren explains that Harry is clearly giving his \"full attention and engagement\" to everyone he interacts with, a clear sign of his improved confidence.\n\nPointing out Harry's continued use of eye contact and bold gestures, Darren also went on to highlight how this made him \"open and welcoming\" instead of \"restricted and closed off\" which he has been on previous occasions.\n\n\"He feels comfortable and at ease,\" concludes the expert.\n\nAlthough Harry has so far made it to the UK alone, his wife Meghan Markle is due to join him later in the week for a pre-planned trip to Nigeria. Confirming the news on ITV news, royal editor Chris Ship explained: \" Prince Harry travelled to the UK alone - without Meghan or the children Archie and Lilibet.\"\n\nHe then added: \"Meghan will not accompany Harry to the St Paul's Cathedral in London tomorrow. But she will be with Harry for their visit to Nigeria later this week.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phoebe_tonks@ok.co.uk", "name": "Phoebe Tonks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honourable_Artillery_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honourable Artillery Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32757251.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SOCIAL-TEMPLATE2023-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 305, "textEnd": 310}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nPrince Harry's relationship with the royal family has grown increasingly fractured since he and the Duchess of Sussex stepped down as working royals in 2020.\n\nAt the time, the couple promised to still \"regularly\" visit the UK, but after leaving almost four years ago, they have only returned from their new home in California a handful of times.\n\nMeghan has not been in the country since the Queen's funeral in September 2020 and she chose to skip King Charles's coronation in May of last year.\n\nShe has also skipped the UK celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, which Prince Harry is currently attending, and will instead join him in a few days time for the Nigerian events.\n\nWhile it was hoped that King Charles's recent cancer diagnosis would go some way to repairing fractured relations, and this appeared to be the case when Harry flew over after learning of his illness, this now seems unlikely.\n\nSince arriving back in the UK yesterday (7 May), the Duke of Sussex has endured two apparent snubs from his family - with his father claiming that he is too busy to meet him on his current visit and the news today that Prince William is being made colonel-in-chief of Harry's old military regiment.\n\nThis is a timeline of how relations between the couple and the firm have played out following what's better known as Megxit.\n\nFollowing Harry and Meghan's announcement that they were stepping down as senior royals in January 2020, they left the UK for California that June.\n\nAt the time, they cited their reasons for leaving as being press intrusion and a desire to be financially independent. They also believed that they could give their son, Prince Archie, a more peaceful upbringing in the US.\n\nWhile they lost their HRH titles, they remained the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nHarry and Meghan opened up in explicit detail about why they chose to leave the firm almost a year after their departure in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThey cited racism as a reason for leaving, revealing that an unnamed member of the royal family speculated about the colour of Prince Archie's skin before he was born.\n\nMeghan also revealed for the first time that she suffered from suicidal ideation while working for the royals and did not receive the support she needed to get better.\n\n\"I was really ashamed to say it at the time, and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry especially because I know how much loss he has suffered. But I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it - and I just didn't want to be alive anymore,\" she said.\n\nThe couple kept a low profile at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, but their presence was considered a move in the right direction as it was their first major event since stepping down in 2020.\n\nIt also provided the couple with an opportunity to introduce their then-one-year-old daughter Lilibet to her family, including the Queen, who she had not met until this point.\n\nThe couple returned to the UK later in 2022 to carry out other engagements in the UK and this ended up coinciding with the Queen's death. Following her passing, they chose to stay in the country until after her state funeral.\n\nMeghan previously spoke about the high regard in which she held the Queen to Oprah.\n\n\"The Queen has always been wonderful to me,\" she said. \"I just really loved being in her company ... she's always been warm and inviting and really welcoming.\"\n\nPrince Harry further opened up about his life in the royal family in his memoir Spare, which detailed his life growing up in his brother's shadow, his mother's death, and his eventual time in the military.\n\nHe also recounted his relationship with Meghan and their ultimate decision to leave the royal life behind.\n\nHarry wrote with the help of a ghostwriter: \"The Heir and the Spare - there was no judgment about it, but also no ambiguity. I was the shadow, the support, the Plan B. I was brought into the world in case something happened to Willy.\n\n\"I was summoned to provide backup, distraction, diversion and, if necessary, a spare part. Kidney, perhaps. Blood transfusion, Speck of bone marrow. This was all made explicitly clear to me from the start of life's journey.\"\n\nIn June of last year, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Harry and Meghan had vacated Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which had been gifted to the couple by the Queen.\n\nThey were asked to leave and their departure left them without an address in the UK.\n\nThe home was initially renovated at a cost of \u00a32.4m to the taxpayer, but the couple repaid this sum after choosing to leave previous roles as working royals in 2020.\n\nSir Michael Stevens, keeper of the Privy Purse, said: \"We can confirm that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have vacated Frogmore Cottage.\n\n\"We will not be going into any detail on those arrangements here.\n\n\"Safe to say that, as has previously been stated, the Duke and Duchess have paid for the expenditure incurred by the Sovereign Grant in relation to the renovation of Frogmore Cottage, thus leaving the Crown with a greatly enhanced asset.\"\n\nFollowing the loss of the cottage last June, Harry changed his place of typical residence from the UK to the US for the first time.\n\nThe subject of alleged racism within the royal family came up once again in December of last year when an author favoured by the Sussexes appeared to disclose the name of the family member who speculated about the colour of Archie's skin.\n\nOmid Scobie later claimed he had no idea a Dutch translation of his book Endgame would appear to name King Charles and the Princess of Wales people responsible for the comments.\n\nFebruary 2024, The King's cancer diagnosis\n\nWhile the relationship between the Sussexes and their wider family appeared bleak for some time, renewed hope of a true reconciliation came earlier this year when King Charles announced that he has cancer.\n\nHarry told Good Morning America at the time: \"I think any illness, any sickness brings families together.\"\n\nAfter learning of his father's illness, Harry immediately travelled to the UK and the pair spent a reported 45 minutes together.\n\n\"The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that,\" Harry admitted.\n\nDespite returning to the UK this week for an event of huge personal importance - the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, which Harry founded in 2014 - Harry will not be joined at the thanksgiving ceremony by any members of his immediate family, it has been confirmed.\n\nWhile it was expected that he was unlikely to see Prince William and Kate Middleton, who is also battling cancer herself, many believed that Harry would see the King on the trip, who only last week returned to work after making sufficient progress in his own cancer journey.\n\nBut it emerged yesterday that the King simply has too many engagements to see his youngest son, despite the Palace announcing that he was undertaking a reduced summer schedule to avoid over-exertion.\n\nThis turn of events mirrors the opinion of former BBC royal correspondent Michael Cole, who asserted ahead of this week's trip that a true reconciliation in the near future was unlikely.\n\n\"After so much bad blood, it is very difficult indeed to see any sort of reconciliation between the Sussexes and the Royal Family happening [this] week - or for the foreseeable future,\" he admitted.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk",

His Majesty had constitutional and public-facing duties as well as medical prior engagements.\"\n\nAnother senior insider added: \"Nothing has changed. There are issues of trust that still need to be addressed.\"\n\nHarry's very public airing of life in the royal family -- in the Oprah Winfrey interview and again in his memoir Spare -- were among the reasons for the continuing family rift\n\nHowever, news of the King's cancer diagnosis in February led to a thaw in relations. The duke, who lives with his family in California, rushed back to see his father, who was said to be \"enormously touched\" by the gesture.\n\nBut asked about a possible meeting during Harry's latest trip, a spokesman for him said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry spent Tuesday in London attending a summit that reflected on the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. Interviewed by TV presenter Louise Minchin, he told delegates at the Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters on the edge of the City: \"Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'. But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty -- but what we've created is a global community.\"\n\nDuring Wednesday's service at St Paul's, Harry was set to give a reading and actor Damian Lewis was to recite the Invictus poem. The King, who has recently returned to public-facing duties after his cancer diagnosis, yesterday met the prime minister of Fiji at Buckingham Palace, before retiring to Clarence House.\n\nThe King was also set to have his weekly audience with the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and attend a Privy Council meeting.\n\nWithin hours of the duke arriving in the UK yesterday, the palace announced that the King and his older son the Prince of Wales would appear at an engagement next Monday, assigning William a significant military role previously anticipated for Harry.\n\nCharles will be at a ceremony to confirm William, 41, as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps -- Harry's former regiment.

And on the face of it, the King was very busy on Monday.\n\nFrom Windsor Castle where he had spent the Bank Holiday, he had an audience with Fiji's prime minister at Buckingham Palace, followed by a meeting with senior military commanders, and then medical appointments connected to his ongoing cancer treatment, the last of which are followed by an obligation to rest.\n\nToday promises more of the same, including a palace garden party and his regular weekly sit down with PM Rishi Sunak, who after last week's drubbing for the Tories in the local elections may need more consoling than usual.\n\nWhat there most definitely was no time for amid all this coming and going, was any kind of get together with his younger son.\n\nPrince Harry's arrival in Britain had triggered speculation that father and son would meet.\n\nSome had even boldly suggested that such a meeting might, at long last, start a process of reconciliation between the King and Harry.\n\nIndeed, there was even murmur of an olive branch being extended.\n\nInstead, the hand-wringing excuses of \"full diaries\" offers a different and, for Harry, a more ominous message.\n\nUnlike that dramatic flying visit in February, where the Prince was granted a less than 30-minute meeting just after Charles' cancer diagnosis had been made public, the palace gates remained firmly closed.\n\nPointedly, it was the Duke of Sussex's team that broke cover with a spokesman explaining that a meeting \"unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program\".\n\nEven with the acknowledgement that Harry recognised his father's \"commitments and various other priorities\", the nuance in the bulletin was clear: the failure to meet was not Harry's fault.\n\nSo much for olive branches.\n\nWhat then is going on, and what do events tell us about the state of relations between the exiled Harry, his father and the rest of the royal family?\n\nOne conclusion would suggest that, far from his hope of reuniting with his father in the wake of the King's cancer diagnosis, the illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement.\n\nBut, in fact, I understand that there had been no formal request from either the King or his son to schedule a meeting.\n\nFor Harry also had a packed program. From his overnight flight from Los Angeles, he was whisked to an event for the Invictus Games, his project for wounded and former armed forces personnel, at Armoury House in East London.\n\nAlthough little more than three miles from Buckingham Palace, he might as well have been on a different continent as far as meeting his family was concerned.\n\nAnd today, while the King hosts the first garden party of the year, the Prince will mark the tenth anniversary of the games with a service at St Paul's cathedral.\n\nIf Harry had been so set on seeing his father, it is tempting to wonder why he didn't fly over a day or two earlier when Charles had no official duties.\n\nHow significant that might have been if they had been together on the first anniversary of the King's coronation. Inconveniently, that fell on Prince Archie's fifth birthday and Harry chose to spend it with his family in California.\n\nOnce, Harry's return visits to the UK meant it was relatively straightforward for him to drop in on his father, but he no longer has royal accommodation.\n\nAnd, intriguingly, he made no request to stay at any royal residence for this two-night visit.\n\nThis alone suggests that chances of a rapprochement are more remote than ever.\n\nTrust too has evaporated in the 16 months since Harry's explosive memoir Spare, with its excoriating attacks on Camilla, William and Kate.\n\nThe two men once shared a special bond, but each meeting between them became distracted with the weight of previous disappointments.\n\nSome old friends were surprised that given his Christian faith, a King who practises humility and empathy as a matter of course, could find no time to see his son.\n\nOthers argued that no blame could surely be attached to Charles if he viewed such encounters with his son as more a burden than a pleasure.\n\nWhat is certain is that notwithstanding that busy workload, two figures would have viewed the prospect of a meeting between the King and Harry deeply troubling -- Queen Camilla, who was hurt by Harry's lacerating attacks, and Prince William who will not forgive his brother for his comments about Kate.\n\nLast month, the historian Tessa Dunlop suggested Harry was in a \"painful place\" following the Princess of Wales's cancer diagnosis and William's remarks.\n\n\"The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,\" says a courtier.\n\n\"For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.\"\n\nPerhaps the most telling observation on the broken relationship between Harry and the royals came in, not off-the-record briefings yesterday, but publication of a future joint engagement between the King and his son -- the other one.\n\nNext Monday, Charles will, amid a colourful ceremony, formally hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to Prince William.\n\nHarry, of course, enjoyed a distinguished career with the combat aviation arm of the Army, serving with considerable bravery as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan.\n\nThis passing of the baton, however, speaks more eloquently of a united family.\n\nIncreasingly, it is hard to see Harry ever again fitting in.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Their strained relationship, evident since 2020, remains unresolved. Royal experts see the lack of a meeting as a significant snub, reflecting the depth of the divide.\n\nBuckingham Palace recently declared a shift in military leadership, with King Charles III passing on Prince Harry's position as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to Prince William.\n\nThe transition ceremony is scheduled for May 13 at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop.\n\nThe Palace's statement reads, \"His Majesty The King will officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.\"\n\n\"In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, The King was pleased to announce military appointments, including that The Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.

At the time, the Father-Son duo met at Clarence House for 45 minutes, but the duke had no meeting with his brother William.\n\nAnticipation for another reunion was reportedly high this week, but Harry confirmed they won't meet during his London trip despite his event being just three miles away from Clarence House. Instead, Harry's foundation, Archewell, stated that the Duke of Sussex will meet with city financier Guy Monson.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry is expected to remain in the UK for only three days before embarking on an unofficial royal tour of Nigeria with his wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nTheir invitation came from Nigeria's Chief of Defence Staff, Christopher Gwabin Musa, who crossed paths with the couple during last year's Invictus Games in Germany.\n\nRoyal experts have given varied opinions on Charles and Harry's decision not to meet each other.\n\nRichard Fitzwilliams noted,\" 'This, whatever the logistics, will be widely perceived as a snub. This is one of the most public rifts in the world. If it was handled in private without so much press speculation, it would have a better chance of being resolved.\"\n\nSimilarly, Michael Cole described it as \"quite a snub,\" explaining: \"For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide.\"\n\nCole referred to it as the \"big medicine\" in royal terms, highlighting that \"this is a royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne. Actions have consequences, but rarely are they played out as starkly as they are here.\"\n\n\"Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message, and many people will say, 'About time too,'\" he added.\n\nAccording to reports, it is unlikely that Harry and William will reconnect during this trip, given their estrangement since 2020, when the duke and his wife Meghan decided to step back from royal duties and move to California.\n\nHarry had openly discussed his strained relationship with his older brother and expressed a desire to mend it.\n\nIn an interview with ITV last year, he stated: \"My brother and I love each other. I love him deeply. There has been a lot of pain between the two of us, especially over the last six years.\"\n\nHe emphasized his love for his family and hoped for private reconciliation, adding: \"I love my father, I love my brother, and I love family. I don't think my father or brother will read the book. ... But what they have to say to me and what I have to say to them will be in private, and I hope it can stay that way.\"\n\nIn contrast, William has not publicly addressed their feud.", "source": {"uri":

The Duke of Sussex is briefly in the U.K. for business reasons, but it's hard not to think about his father, King Charles III, who is currently battling cancer. While a Sussex spokesperson made it clear that there would be no father-son meeting, it's being reported that Harry had a specific request that the palace would not honor.\n\nPrince Harry and King Charles apparently engaged in a \"difficult\" round of negations, according to royal expert Charlotte Griffith. She told GB News, \"There is some talk that behind the scenes, a lot of negotiating went on. I think the reason was because Harry made certain demands about who could be in the room and who couldn't.\" It's no secret that the Duke of Sussex is not a fan of Queen Camilla, who joined Harry and his dad for their 45-minute visit after his cancer diagnosis was revealed earlier this year. What does it take for a son to be able to see his father alone?\n\n\"Maybe other forces were driving Charles's position on this,\" Griffiths speculated. \"William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all. We know that Charles likes to meet Harry with Camilla in the room which isn't always a popular decision. Harry was without his wife as well, so this was fraught with difficulty.\" It feels like the Duke of Sussex's continued outreach toward his family always has a wall or obstacle to get around. It's still hard to believe that not a single working royal will be at his Invictus Games celebration, even though he reportedly extended an invitation.\n\nThe perceived slight has also garnered criticism from a former palace staffer, who thinks the royal family is making the wrong move. \"Charles has made it quite clear he is ready to be friendly and supportive to Harry in his capacity as a private person, as his dad, but he is not going to throw the weight of the institution behind Invictus again,\" the insider told The Daily Beast. \"This all seems very logical inside the Palace bubble, but the trouble is that people who don't particularly care about such things, who are dimly aware that the royals spend their days visiting community centers and opening supermarkets, are going to wonder why they are boycotting this terrific charity that is headed by the king's son.\"\n\nWhile Griffith thinks that Harry is being \"difficult\" by asking for a meeting alone with his father, he does have a right to privacy. He and Meghan Markle have been burned by palace insiders leaking information about them in the past, and the best way for him to protect his peace is with a one-on-one moment with his dad. The royal family feud doesn't need the interference of others.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristyn_burtt@sheknows.com", "name": "Kristyn Burtt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-harry_b44648.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Their visit was brief, with Harry staying a mere 24 hours in the country before leaving.\n\nOn May 8, Harry returns to his country of birth to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nIt seemed the perfect opportunity to reconnect with his royal family, as he has no see his father since his last trip and has not traveled to the U.K. since Kate Middleton annonced her own cancer diagnosis.\n\nHowever, it sounds like no one has time for Harry right now - literally.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" a spokesperson for Harry told The Post ahead of Harry's visit.\n\nThe King's schedule includes his weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, as well as the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season.\n\nIt's really a shame to hear Harry won't be seeing his dad, given the state of his health. Harry could also have used some family time, since he made the trek to London alone.\n\nMeghan Markle and their two young kids, Archie and Lilibeth, stayed behind in California.\n\nStill, Harry is trying to save face.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nAs for Harry's commitments, he's expected to give a reading at London's St Paul's Cathedral on May 8 to mark the inaugural Invictus Games took place a decade earlier. He will stay, as he did before, in a hotel, rather than a royal residence.\n\nPrince Harry will also not be seeing his brother Prince William and Kate Middleton on this trip. He has not seen his only brother and that side of the family for over a year, as tensions remain high between the two families.\n\nBesides, it's clear that Kate and William are going through it right now and extra drama is kind of the last thing they need.\n\nA few days before Harry's arrival, designer Amaia Arrieta made some seemingly offhand remarks about the royal couple while speaking to the Daily Telegraph.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken at the moment,\" Arrieta expressed. \"I think they are going through hell.\"\n\nArrieta added: \"I hope they will be back. It's really personal.\"\n\nMost infer that Arrieta is referring to the state of the Prince and Princess of Wales as the latter undergoes cancer treatments.\n\nIn January, surgeons uncovered signs of cancer in Kate's abdomen. Despite her status as a taxpayer-funded national symbol, many details of her diagnosis remain secret. For months, the royal firm concealed her cancer altogether, claiming that she was simply recovering from surgery.\n\nNow, thanks in part to a colossal PR blunder by the royals, everyone knows about Kate's condition. Like her father-in-law, she has cancer but aims to make a full recovery. We hope that she does.\n\nSome have interpreted Arrieta's statement as a reference to William and Kate experiencing marital problems.\n\nFrom the Prince of Pegging's alleged affairs to the alarming statistics on men leaving cancer-stricken wives, there has been a lot of speculation over the state of their royal marriage.\n\nIt is possible that Kate's cancer diagnosis has brought other marital issues to the forefront, or at least coincided with them. Occam's Razor, however, suggests that Arrieta is referring to Kate's cancer crisis. Surely, that is enough \"hell\" for anyone.\n\nIn general, Kensington Palace likes to keep a strict lid on any comments that anyone with access to the royal family might make to the press. Usually, that means that negative stories about Meghan Markle are fair game, but everything else must remain under seal.\n\nHowever, historically, the royal family has shown tremendous latitude towards the wardrobe department. There were times when Angela Kelly was effectively Queen Elizabeth's personal gatekeeper.\n\nOne assumes that Arrieta's relationship with the Prince and Princess of Wales will endure.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_delott@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Simon Delott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairo_Arrieta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jairo Arrieta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occam's razor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/Nicole-Kidman-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 453, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Tonight at St. Paul's Cathedral, he is scheduled to deliver a speech during a thanksgiving ceremony. However, the Duke of Sussex received a major royal snub from his ailing father, King Charles, ahead of his scheduled return. The King has refused to meet his younger son, citing 'conflicting schedules.' Addressing the 'act of power play' by the crown, Piers Morgan wrote for The UK Sun, \"Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now.\"\n\nMorgan continued: \"Let's be honest: if Charles had really wanted to see him, he'd have made the time. That's the whole point of being a King, you get to do what the hell you like.\" The veteran journalist added, \"Charles is so disgusted, he won't even give him the time of day. Harry's officially persona non-royal grata, from the Monarch down, and it's no less than he deserves for his despicable behavior.\"\n\nAs per The Independent, the Duke has arrived in his home country without his children, Archie and Lilibet, or his 42-year-old wife Meghan Markle. Also, it was acknowledged that no members of his close family would be present at the event.\n\nPrince Harry's spokesperson stated: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\" Chris Ship, the royal editor, announced the Duke's arrival on X, revealing that he would also be attending 'Invictus-related' events today.\n\nShip also confirmed that Prince Harry is not scheduled to meet his father despite being present in the same city. Before attending the St. Paul's Cathedral event on Wednesday, which also marked the tenth anniversary, Harry arrived at the Honourable Artillery Company's offices on the outskirts of the City of London for the one-day summit known as the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation.\n\nWriting in the foreword for the summit, the Duke stated: \"It has been an honor to watch the Invictus Games Foundation grow over the years; what began as a vision to pay tribute to the courage and resilience of wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veterans, has flourished into an international organization built on hope, strength, and unity.\" Harry was motivated to start the international competition after witnessing how wounded US military soldiers benefited from the challenge of competing in sports that aided in their rehabilitation during the 2013 Warrior Games in Colorado. Later, in 2014, he hosted the first games in London's Olympic Park. Other cities where he hosted events in 2016 were Orlando, Toronto, and Sydney.\n\nPrince Harry evoked excitement for the 2025 games to be held in Vancouver: \"As we look ahead to the first winter hybrid Games at Vancouver Whistler 2025 next year, we are eager to celebrate the Invictus Spirit once again - exemplified in every single competitor, staff, friend and family member - your commitment, enthusiasm and belief, have been the driving force behind our continued success.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Charles had received a cancer diagnosis in February. He spent barely an hour with his father, who has made good progress toward full recovery in recent weeks and may even get back to work. It is his first major UK event since he and Meghan stepped back as senior working royals, confirming the prince's UK return very much in action.\n\nPrince Harry is now all set to return to the UK in the wake of the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, with the due date of attending a Thanksgiving service at London's St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, May 8. Specifically, he will not travel with Meghan Markle.\n\nAccording to royal expert Ingrid Seward, King Charles would want to see Prince Harry during his visit, depending on his living conditions in the capital. Seward claims that Harry's property security is crucial, potentially leading to a father-son reunion. Charles has so many official appointments at Buckingham Palace, among them his weekly meeting with the Prime Minister, and he wants to regain his son's trust.\n\nEven though the visit will most likely be very short, it comes at the same time as an important date for the family: their son's 5th birthday\u00e2\u0080\"Archie. Following their trip to the UK, the Duchess of Sussex will accompany her husband, Prince Harry, on another work engagement, this time in Nigeria, at the invitation of the Nigerian Chief of Defence Staff.\n\n\u00c2", "source": {"uri": "indiaglitz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaGlitz.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://1847884116.rsc.cdn77.org/tamil/news/harry060524_1-d31.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 752, "textEnd": 757}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Part of the reason for that is that on the very day that we discovered that Harry and Charles weren't going to meet, they also put out a news release advertising an event next week in which Charles is going to give William an accolade that 100% would have gone to Harry if Harry was still a working member of the royal family.\"\n\n\"It's about how the public read the myth of the motivation behind [Charles] not seeing Harry,\" Royston said of how this move will play with the public.\n\n\"When it was simply the case that Charles wasn't going to see him, that was hugely disappointing. The risk is that they look like it's deliberate and that it's petty, so they need to realize that if the public perceive this as a petty swipe at Harry.\n\nThe expert went on claiming: \"That could actually wind up playing very badly for the monarchy, because this is a subject on which Harry still commands huge respect as a veteran of Afghanistan.\"\n\nHe said: \"I get asked so often, 'Will they ever simply repair the relationship?' And I think that's what most members of the public actually want more than anything else.

He is due on a visit to Cornwall in southwest England, and the Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWilliam's wife Catherine is also undergoing cancer treatment and has not made any public appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.\n\ngmo-phz/jm", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The discussion, \"The IGF Conversation: Realizing a Global Community,\" is set to reflect on the global community of service personnel and their families that the Invictus Games has fostered since its inception a decade ago through the power of adaptive sport, from Prince Harry's initial inspiration at the Warrior Games to Invictus' impact in the years since.\n\nPrince Harry, a former captain in the British Army who served two tours in Afghanistan, launched the adaptive sports tournament for service personnel and veterans in 2014.

I was at the DJ sets and trying to choose some of the music, put the lights on and get people on their feet.\n\n'And...is Guy in the house? Guy Monson? Are you here? No? Well we're having dinner at his place later so he'll definitely be there.'\n\nJudi James, body language expert, said Harry name-dropped his friend because he wanted to let people know he won't be alone in his hotel room tonight. Above: Prince Harry at Armoury House in London this afternoon for an Invictus Games discussion\n\nJudi said Prince Harry appeared to be touching his wedding ring, a sign that he is wanting to evoke emotional back-up from his wife and family back in the States\n\nPrince Harry speaks with a member of the Company of Pikemen and Musketeers at the Honourable Artillery Company in London today, while appearing to clutch onto his wedding ring\n\nThe Duke of Sussex will enjoy dinner this evening with Guy Monson, who attended the unveiling of a statue of Princess Diana in 2021 at Kensington Palace (he is seen on the far left)\n\nGuy Monson is a city financier and a trustee of the Invictus Games Foundation, who was on the organising committee for the launch in 2014.\n\nIn 2018, he was appointed treasurer to William and Kate and Harry and Meghan, before the Sussexes stepped down as working royals.\n\nGuy, chief investment officer of Sarasin and Partners, a London-based \u00a318billion investment fund, was alongside the warring brothers when they unveiled a statue of their mother Princess Diana in 2021 at Kensington Palace. It was Harry and William's last solo engagement together.\n\nSpeaking of the moment, Judi James, a body language expert, told FEMAIL that the name-dropping was intentional to put out a message to the crowd that he won't be short of company during his stay in the UK.\n\nShe said: 'He looks keen to be meeting friends here in the UK, at one point he name-checks someone, rubbing his upper thigh with both hands in a gesture of positive anticipation.\n\n'[Harry] then throws in the info that he will be having dinner with them tonight as though keen to let everyone know he will not be sitting alone in his room, dining from room service and the mini-bar and pining for dinner at the Palace.'\n\nHarry is expected to stay at a hotel in London because he no longer has Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.\n\nHarry at Armoury House in London today for an Invictus Games panel with Louise Minchin\n\nHarry was three miles away from Charles at the Invictus Games discussion in London today\n\nThe Prince had hoped to meet his estranged father the King during his trip, which follows a previous quick visit in February after Charles's cancer diagnosis. And Harry's event was just three miles away from where Charles was at Clarence House.\n\nBut Harry's spokesman said today: 'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n'The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nDuring his walk, where he spoke to Pikemen and Musketeers at the Honourable Artillery Company, Harry can be seen appearing to clutch onto his wedding ring.\n\nJudi said the Duke may have been doing this to feel 'emotional support' from his wife, Meghan, but also family in the states.\n\nShe said: 'As he walks he brings his hands up in a barrier gesture and he seems to clutch at his wedding ring.\n\n'This is a self-comfort ritual that suggests desire to evoke emotional back-up from friends and family back in the US.'\n\nThe body language expert said he also walked around the grounds, exuding confidence.\n\n'His walk towards the camera retains signals of confidence, with a leg-splay and an eye-smile suggesting delight at being able to adopt a princely air again as he, although not quite reviewing the troops, walks along past the military musicians as though going through similar motions.'\n\nJudi added that Prince Harry was keen to display 'power' and 'status' while speaking onstage at the event.\n\nShe said: 'Harry's on-stage presentation is a similar blend of peacocking mixed with some signs that this display might be based on bravado.\n\n'His thighs are splayed wide to signal physical power and status and his back is slightly slumped to imply he is relaxed.'\n\nSky News also captured the father-of-two on camera exiting a black Range Rover at Armoury House today.\n\nAs he opens the door and leaves the car, the Duke swings his blazer around slightly before putting it on.\n\nJudi said: 'Harry makes a rather dashing entrance to the UK here, swirling his jacket around like a cape as he exits his car to suggest he has no desire to keep a low profile.\n\nPrince Harry is seen at Armoury House in London today attending an Invictus Games event. Judi said he swirled his jacket around to show that he does not intend to keep a low profile on his visit\n\nKing Charles III waves as he is driven away from Clarence House in London this morning\n\nFebruary 14, 2024 -- Harry and Meghan attend an Invictus Games event in Whistler, Canada\n\n'The gesture involves some leg-splaying and pit-baring, both rituals that are connected to confidence although this can also mean bravado rather than the authentic thing.'\n\nHarry is understood to have various Invictus Games commitments today, according to ITV. These are expected to include further meetings and a dinner this evening.\n\nTomorrow, the Duke is set to give a reading at a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral marking a decade since the inaugural competition in London in 2014.\n\nOrganisers had said there was no confirmation of any other royals attending, or if Harry's wife Meghan Markle or children Archie and Lilibet would also be in the UK.\n\nBut Harry arrived in London by himself today, and is expected to join the Duchess on a tour to Nigeria later this week with Meghan set to fly there from the US by herself.\n\nAnd Harry is not expected to see his brother Prince William , who is scheduled to be away from the capital on Thursday and Friday, or his sister-in-law Kate Middleton whose cancer treatment continues following her revealing the diagnosis in March.\n\nEarlier today, Charles was photographed being driven from Windsor Castle before arriving at Clarence House in London soon after. The King later held an audience nearby at Buckingham Palace with the Prime Minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka.\n\nThe Duke has invited William and other senior members of the Royal Family to the service but none of them are expected to attend, sources told Page Six in the US.\n\nAmong the royals who could attend are his cousins Zara Tindall and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, but there has been no confirmation of this.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The prince joined a panel on Tuesday for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The discussion, \"The IGF Conversation: Realizing a Global Community,\" aimed to highlight service personnel and their families.\n\nWhile the event celebrated the 39-year-old's cause, royal watchers told Fox News Digital Harry's visit to the U.K. won't spark a reconciliation with his family as the House of Windsor is rocked by health woes.\n\nPRINCE HARRY WON'T MEET WITH KING CHARLES DURING TRIP TO UK FOR INVICTUS GAMES ANNIVERSARY\n\n\"Harry would love to reconnect with Kate [Middleton],\" Christopher Andersen, author of \"The King,\" claimed to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"They were once extremely close, and Harry was hit hard by the news of her cancer diagnosis, which he learned about just the way the rest of us did, via Kate's shocking video,\" Andersen claimed. \"Unfortunately, it doesn't appear [Prince] William is willing to let his brother anywhere near his ailing wife.\n\n\"There was just too much drama between the brothers and their wives, and there is lingering bitterness on everyone's part,\" Andersen continued. \"So, the chances of even a meeting between Harry and the rest of the royal family, much less some sort of reconciliation, seem extremely slim.\"\n\nIn a video shared in March, the Princess of Wales, 42, revealed she's battling a form of cancer. Her stunning announcement followed weeks of speculation about her health and whereabouts.\n\nMiddleton asked for \"time, space and privacy\" while she is treated for an unspecified type of cancer that was discovered after what she described as \"major\" surgery.\n\nIn February, Buckingham Palace announced the king had also been diagnosed with a form of cancer and is undergoing treatment. A \"separate issue of concern\" was identified during the monarch's \"benign prostate enlargement\" procedure at the London Clinic.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,\" the palace said in a statement at the time.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex confirmed to Fox News Digital that the prince, 39, wouldn't be meeting with his father.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nWhile the Princess of Wales has been keeping a low profile during her recovery, the king has returned to public-facing duties as he continues his treatment.\n\n\"The king has softened a bit toward his younger son but hasn't forgotten how Harry attacked [his wife] Queen Camilla in his memoir 'Spare,'\" Andersen claimed. \"In his book, Harry branded her a 'villain' and described how both he and William begged their father not to marry her. For Charles, that is an unforgivable sin.\"\n\nHarry has had a troubled relationship with the royal family since he quit royal duties. According to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media prompted the move to California in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeghan Markle, a former American actress, became the Duchess of Sussex when she married the British prince in 2018.\n\nFollowing their departure, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex aired their grievances about life as royals. In 2021, they sat down with Oprah Winfrey for an interview that was viewed by 50 million people globally. During the sit-down, Markle alleged Middleton left her in tears leading up to her royal wedding due to a disagreement over bridesmaid dresses.\n\nFollowing the release of a six-part docuseries on Netflix in 2022, Harry's memoir \"Spare\" hit bookshelves in 2023, quickly becoming a bestseller.\n\nIt was in \"Spare\" that Harry described his once close-knit bond with Middleton.\n\n\"I loved my new sister-in-law,\" Harry wrote. \"I felt she was more sister than in-law, the sister I've never had and always wanted, and I was pleased that she'd forever be standing by Willy's side. She was a good match for my older brother. They made each other visibly happy, and therefore I was happy too.\"\n\n\"She was carefree, sweet, kind,\" Harry reflected. \"She'd done a gap year in Florence, knew about photography, art. And clothes. She loved clothes. ... I liked making her laugh. And I was quite good at it. My transparently silly side connected with her heavily disguised silly side.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"Whenever I worried that Kate was going to be the one to take Willy from me, I consoled myself with thoughts of all our future laughing fits together, and I told myself how great everything would be when I had a serious girlfriend who could laugh along with us,\" he added.\n\n\"Although it could have been the perfect opportunity for Prince Harry to visit the Princess of Wales ... this is highly unlikely as the Princess of Wales needs calm positive influences around her,\" British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Prince William will not allow anything to get in the way of his wife's healing, is deeply protective of his family and will not welcome a chaotic Prince Harry arriving at his doorstep,\" Chard said. \"Prince Harry has created much hurt and upset for the prince and princess of Wales and his family. He has many fences to build before he can expect his family to welcome him with open arms. Fingers crossed he will get on with building these bridges in private, as I'm sure he misses his family.\n\n\"The Princess of Wales is diplomatic and is the peacekeeper within the family but is not well enough to navigate a meeting with Prince Harry at this point,\" Chard added.\n\n\"I am being told that there is no cooling of hostilities between Harry and William,\" Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"This is the type of issue King Charles would wish to go away,\" he added. \"I am told privately he misses not being able to meet his American grandchildren. It was even thought that Harry, Meghan and their children may be offered to come to Balmoral this summer to use the tranquility of the estate to mend broken fences and find a workable way forward.\"\n\nKING CHARLES, KATE MIDDLETON'S CANCER BATTLES MAKE THEM MORE RELATABLE TO BRITISH PUBLIC: EXPERTS\n\nOne thing royal watchers do agree on is that Harry will continue to focus on his passion project.\n\nModeled after the Warrior Games in the United States, Harry founded the Invictus Games in 2014 as a Paralympic-style event designed to inspire military veterans around the world as they work to overcome battlefield injuries. Harry was a former captain in the British Army.\n\nThe Invictus Games were created when the royal was patron of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

And on the face of it, the King was very busy on Monday.\n\nFrom Windsor Castle where he had spent the Bank Holiday, he had an audience with Fiji's prime minister at Buckingham Palace, followed by a meeting with senior military commanders, and then medical appointments connected to his ongoing cancer treatment, the last of which are followed by an obligation to rest.\n\nToday promises more of the same, including a palace garden party and his regular weekly sit down with PM Rishi Sunak, who after last week's drubbing for the Tories in the local elections may need more consoling than usual.\n\nWhat there most definitely was no time for amid all this coming and going, was any kind of get together with his younger son.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nPrince Harry's arrival in Britain had triggered speculation that father and son would meet.\n\nSome had even boldly suggested that such a meeting might, at long last, start a process of reconciliation between the King and Harry.\n\nIndeed, there was even murmur of an olive branch being extended.\n\nInstead, the hand-wringing excuses of \"full diaries\" offers a different and, for Harry, a more ominous message.\n\nUnlike that dramatic flying visit in February, where the Prince was granted a less than 30-minute meeting just after Charles' cancer diagnosis had been made public, the palace gates remained firmly closed.\n\nPointedly, it was the Duke of Sussex's team that broke cover with a spokesman explaining that a meeting \"unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program\".\n\nEven with the acknowledgement that Harry recognised his father's \"commitments and various other priorities\", the nuance in the bulletin was clear: the failure to meet was not Harry's fault.\n\nSo much for olive branches.\n\nWhat then is going on, and what do events tell us about the state of relations between the exiled Harry, his father and the rest of the royal family?\n\nOne conclusion would suggest that, far from his hope of reuniting with his father in the wake of the King's cancer diagnosis, the illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement.\n\nBut, in fact, I understand that there had been no formal request from either the King or his son to schedule a meeting.\n\nFor Harry also had a packed program. From his overnight flight from Los Angeles, he was whisked to an event for the Invictus Games, his project for wounded and former armed forces personnel, at Armoury House in East London.\n\nAlthough little more than three miles from Buckingham Palace, he might as well have been on a different continent as far as meeting his family was concerned.\n\nAnd today, while the King hosts the first garden party of the year, the Prince will mark the tenth anniversary of the games with a service at St Paul's cathedral.\n\nIf Harry had been so set on seeing his father, it is tempting to wonder why he didn't fly over a day or two earlier when Charles had no official duties.\n\nHow significant that might have been if they had been together on the first anniversary of the King's coronation. Inconveniently, that fell on Prince Archie's fifth birthday and Harry chose to spend it with his family in California.\n\nOnce, Harry's return visits to the UK meant it was relatively straightforward for him to drop in on his father, but he no longer has royal accommodation.\n\nAnd, intriguingly, he made no request to stay at any royal residence for this two-night visit.\n\nThis alone suggests that chances of a rapprochement are more remote than ever.\n\nTrust too has evaporated in the 16 months since Harry's explosive memoir Spare, with its excoriating attacks on Camilla, William and Kate.\n\nThe two men once shared a special bond, but each meeting between them became distracted with the weight of previous disappointments.\n\nSome old friends were surprised that given his Christian faith, a King who practises humility and empathy as a matter of course, could find no time to see his son.\n\nOthers argued that no blame could surely be attached to Charles if he viewed such encounters with his son as more a burden than a pleasure.\n\nWhat is certain is that notwithstanding that busy workload, two figures would have viewed the prospect of a meeting between the King and Harry deeply troubling -- Queen Camilla, who was hurt by Harry's lacerating attacks, and Prince William who will not forgive his brother for his comments about Kate.\n\nLast month, the historian Tessa Dunlop suggested Harry was in a \"painful place\" following the Princess of Wales's cancer diagnosis and William's remarks.\n\n\"The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,\" says a courtier.\n\n\"For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.\"\n\nPerhaps the most telling observation on the broken relationship between Harry and the royals came in, not off-the-record briefings yesterday, but publication of a future joint engagement between the King and his son -- the other one.\n\nNext Monday, Charles will, amid a colourful ceremony, formally hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to Prince William.\n\nHarry, of course, enjoyed a distinguished career with the combat aviation arm of the Army, serving with considerable bravery as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan.\n\nThis passing of the baton, however, speaks more eloquently of a united family.\n\nIncreasingly, it is hard to see Harry ever again fitting in.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri":

They stepped down as senior royals in January 2020.\n\nAngry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their \"SussexRoyal\" brand.\n\nHarry remains a prince and is fifth in line to the throne.\n\nThe couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH). Harry also gave up his military titles.\n\nWhen Harry's father Charles became King, the couple's two children became Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex.\n\nWhere do Harry and Meghan live?\n\nHarry and Meghan moved to California in June 2020, saying they wanted space to raise Archie. Lilibet was born there in 2021.\n\nThe couple no longer has an official UK residence.\n\nIn early 2023, they were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage, a Grade-II listed property on the Windsor estate.\n\nIn April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK.\n\nThe change was dated 29 June 2023, thought to be the date the couple formally left Frogmore Cottage.\n\nThe conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundation has raised questions about Harry's immigration status because of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms.\n\nThe duke and duchess returned to the UK for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022, and her funeral in September of that year.\n\nHe has also returned to London for his various court cases against newspaper publishers.\n\nOn 8 May, the duke will attend a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nHarry launched the sporting event for military personnel who have been wounded in action after his own time serving in the armed forces.\n\nHis spokesman confirmed the duke would not see the King during this visit because of his father's \"full programme\".\n\nWhy did Harry take the government to court over his security?\n\nAfter stepping back from official duties, the duke and duchess were no longer afforded the security arrangements provided for senior royals.\n\nWhen Harry first left the UK, he said it would be too dangerous to bring his family back without adequate police protection and took the government to the High Court.\n\nHome Office lawyers said the duke would still have publicly-funded police security in the UK, under \"bespoke arrangements\".\n\nIn late February 2024, the High Court ruled that the chosen approach \"was, and is, legally sound\".\n\nAn earlier separate court ruling rejected the prince's request to be allowed to pay privately for more substantial protection.\n\nIn April 2024, Harry's legal team said he would seek permission from the Court of Appeal to challenge the High Court decision.\n\nHow do Meghan and Harry earn their money?\n\nAs working royals, they received 95% of their annual income from Harry's father, then Prince of Wales. The taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant made up the other 5%.\n\nWhen they stepped down as senior royals, King Charles gave them \"a substantial sum\" to help establish their new life.\n\nHarry and Meghan set up the Archewell charitable foundation, and entered into a number of commercial arrangements with private companies.\n\nIn February 2024 the couple launched their Sussex.com website, which says they are \"shaping the future through business and philanthropy\".\n\nLittle is known about the new venture, but in April 2024, pictures of branded jam jars circulated on social media, suggesting it may sell food products.\n\nTelevision and podcasts\n\nThe Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, has made programmes for Netflix, under a deal thought to be worth millions of dollars.\n\nThese include the Harry and Meghan documentary series, in which the couple talked about life in the Royal Family. The Heart of Invictus series discussed Harry's emotional \"unravelling\" after military service in Afghanistan.\n\nArchewell also made podcasts for Spotify under a contract thought to be worth $25m (\u00a319.7m). The arrangement ended in June 2023.\n\nIt discussed his relationship with his brother and father, as well as his grief over the death of his mother, Princess Diana.\n\nThe book's publishers promised $1.5m (\u00a31.18m) and \u00a3300,000 would be given to the Sentebale and WellChild charities.\n\nMeghan wrote a children's book called The Bench in 2021.\n\nInheritance\n\nWilliam and Harry received the bulk of Princess Diana's \u00a313m fortune when she died in 1997.\n\nIn an interview, Harry told Oprah Winfrey this money funded his family's move to the US.\n\nHe is also thought to have inherited millions from his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother.\n\nIt is not known whether the late Queen left him any money.\n\nActing\n\nDuring her acting career, the Duchess of Sussex was reportedly paid $50,000 (\u00a340,000) for each episode of the legal drama Suits.\n\nHarry settled a phone hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers in February 2024.\n\nHis lawyer said the duke had been awarded \"substantial\" damages. He was also granted \u00a3140,600 in damages in another part of the case.\n\nA number of other court cases are continuing, including:", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The King was seen earlier on Tuesday being driven from Windsor to London ahead of Harry's visit to the capital.\n\nAccording to ITV's royal editor, Chris Ship, the Duke of Sussex is expected to carry out events related to the Invictus Games on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's service. Harry attended the Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters on the edge of London during the day.\n\nAlthough the Duke of Sussex's wife, Meghan Markle, has accompanied him to many Invictus-related events in the past, including last year's games in Dusseldorf and a tour of 2025 host nation Canada, she was't present with the royal on this occasion. Meghan instead remains back at their California home with their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.\n\nHarry's time in the UK will be relatively short, with the Duke reuniting with the Duchess of Sussex later in the week during a joint trip to Nigeria. The couple are understood to have been invited by the Chief of Defence Staff, the highest-ranking military official in Nigeria, who Harry previously met at the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf last September.\n\nAlthough it's not yet confirmed what Harry and Meghan will do in the African country, HELLO! understands that the pair will visit several organisations during the tour.

appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.\n\ngmo-phz/jm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

But sources claimed William didn't want to attend the memorial amid their ongoing rift.\n\nIn 2022, just before their grandmother the Queen died, sources claimed Kate acts as a \"peacemaker\" between the brothers.\n\nLast year Harry claimed his brother \"knocked him to the floor\" during an argument about Meghan.\n\nIn his book Spare, Harry said William branded Meghan \"rude\" and \"difficult\" during a row.\n\nHarry alleged William \"grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and ... knocked me to the floor\".\n\nHe said he was left with a visible injury to his back following the argument in 2019 at Nottingham Cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace, where he was living at the time.\n\nIn January this year, Harry flew in to be with Charles after the monarch's shock cancer diagnosis.\n\nHarry flew back to the US the following day - without seeing Wills.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_goodwin@the-sun.com", "name": "Harry Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Royal Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wallis Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/05/newspress-collage-k2nhp1v6h-1715084080096.jpg?1715069914&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 656, "textEnd": 665}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

During his visit to Britain, it had been thought he could meet with his father, with whom he has a rocky bond, however, it seems it is not possible for him to do so.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty''s full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nFormer Good Morning Britain presenter Piers, 59, has now hit out at Harry, branding him a 'weasel' in a scathing post on X, formerly known as Twitter. After hearing the news that Harry would not have time to meet with his father, who was recently diagnosed with cancer, Piers mocked: \"King Charles has checked his diary and can't find time to see his treacherous weasel of a youngest son.\"\n\nHarry won't have the opportunity to see his father during this visit Piers Morgan has furiously slammed Prince Harry - one again\n\nEver since Harry stepped down from his Royal duties alongside his wife, Meghan Markle, Piers has made his feelings towards the couple clear - and his latest scathing rant on social media is no different. Following his post, unimpressed X users flocked to slam Piers for his 'nasty' words. \"You are a nasty man Piers. Give it a rest for once and for all and leave Harry alone,\" one user hit back.\n\n\"We get it Piers. You don't like Prince Harry. It's giving obsession at this stage - it seems he's all you can talk about,\" another echoed. While someone else quipped back: \"I doubt Harry gives a flying f*** what you think of him to be honest Piers.\"\n\nHarry arrived in the capital today, travelling without his wife Meghan or their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. It is believed he is undertaking several Invictus Games commitments this afternoon and has been seen visiting Armoury House in East London, where he took part in a panel discussion hosted by former BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin at a one-day summit, called the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation.\n\nHarry has had a frosty relationship with his dad, especially since he was highly critical of his royal relatives in his controversial memoir Spare - and and was particularly scathing about his stepmother Camilla. But according to sources, the monarch had been keen to see his son, who now lives in California.\n\nA source said last week: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nHarry's trip to the UK is his second to Britain this year, after February's trip to see his dad a day after it was announced Charles had cancer. Harry managed to see his ailing father for just 30 minutes at Clarence House. It marked a healing step in their relationship that was dented after Harry and Meghan quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US. In a recent US TV interview, Harry said he hoped the King's \u00addiagnosis can have a \"reunifying effect\" on the family.\n\nThe Mirror has reached out to The Palace for comment on this story.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susan_knox@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Susan Knox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Minchin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louise Minchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Breakfast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Breakfast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32756484.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Piers-Morgan-brands-Prince-Harry-a-treacherous-weasel-amid-King-Charles-snub.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Now, all Harry needs to do his job is a serviceable Uniqlo fleece and a round meeting table to ensure there are no visible representations of hierarchical power structures.\n\nSo, it's nice to report today that not only is the Duke of Sussex back in London but one of those under-worn suits is, too, and tailoring have flown in for a series of events in support of his highly successful Invictus Games.\n\nAnd while it's a good day for neutral blazers, it's a bit of a grey day for the 39-year-old.\n\nKing Charles has not only decided he does not want to see his son while he's in the neighbourhood but is about to give Prince William a major gift that would otherwise have gone to Harry.\n\nIn other words, we're talking about a double serving of paternal spurning.\n\nFirst up, hot on the heels of Harry landing in Blighty for what will likely be more of a pit stop than a deep reconnecting with his roots and his former favourite lager taps, came the news that the King simply couldn't make time to see his son.\n\nTeam Sussex seemingly wasted no time informing the press of Charles' decision, with a spokesperson saying that a meeting \"unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nSo, His Majesty isn't exactly champing at the bit to spend 29-minutes or so, as he did in February, with Harry or to hear first hand about how Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex's jam-making ventures are progressing.\n\nThis excuse - a \"full programme\" - is nearly impossible to buy given that Harry's trip had been being discussed for months now. It's impossible to see how, if the King really did want to spend some quality minutes of light shoulder patting and trying to wear his best listening face with Harry he could not have swung it, diary-wise.\n\nTo understand why the King has such a \"full programme\" look no further than Queen Camilla and the complicated business of loyalty.\n\nThe duke's Netflix series and memoir Spare didn't just detail the many failings and sins of Crown Inc and the King but of his wife of nearly 18-years too. Diana, Princess of Wales famously called Camilla \"the Rottweiler\" and Harry similarly painted as equally fanged, calling her \"dangerous\" and saying she had left \"bodies...in the street\" in her quest to be accepted by the British public.\n\nThese \"outrageous comments about Camilla\" have left Charles \"in a very awkward position,\" a friend of both Their Majesties has told the Daily Beast's Tom Sykes.\n\nThe Queen was present when the King and Harry briefly met earlier this year and now the Express has reported that her presence at a possible meeting this week was \"a bone of contention.\"\n\nThere is another factor at play in His Majesty's decision not to see the duke.\n\nOn Wednesday, as Harry is at St Paul's Cathedral for a service to mark ten years of the Invictus Games, Charles will be making his big bells and whistles return to large scale public events at the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season.\n\nAny sort of meeting between the King and the duke would be liable to knock all the buoyant, bouncy PR about His Majesty back at making small talk with the great unwashed off of the front pages and we can't have that now can we?\n\nAlso, as \"a former courtier with good links to the palace\" told Sykes: \"Does Charles want to spend his political capital rehabilitating Harry, especially if Harry then uses that to enhance his commercial deals? That's why a lot of us were sceptical that there was going to be some big heart to heart this week.\"\n\nHowever the King has more on his plate besides making his private secretary Sir Clive Alderton find a polite excuse to give the duke that was not a curt 'no bloody way' - His Majesty has got a rare joint public arrangement with other son and designated Good Boy Prince William to arrange.\n\nMonday will see father and son head off to the Army Aviation Centre in the delightfully-named Middle Wallop in Hampshire, where Charles will officially hand over his role as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps to William.\n\nJust to really drive home the Duke of Sussex's complete and utter isolation out there in the farthest, dimmest, darkest reaches of the royal universe is the fact that, if it had not been for Megxit, Harry would have been a dead certainty to pick up this colonelcy. He actually served in the Army Air Corps in Afghanistan.\n\nThe images we are likely to see on Monday, of Charles and William yukking it up against a backdrop of fighter jets or other bits of billion-pound kit, will be landing right around the time that Harry and Meghan will either still be in, or have just left, Nigeria, for their dupe of a 'royal' tour.\n\nJust imagine the pictures: In one lot, the fifth in line to the throne, fresh off being blanked by his family, doing some freelance, royal-lite events, while in the other, the sovereign and his heir will be palling about the place such that you'd think they have matching friendship bracelets.\n\nOnce upon a time, like right now in 2014 when Charles and William were on jubilant hand to support Harry's first Invictus Games, he would have gotten one of those bracelets too.\n\nHopefully Meghan likes making beaded numbers - or will be selling them via her forthcoming American Riviera Orchard lifestyle brand.", "source":

Harry has since openly discussed his strained relationship with his family in various media appearances, including TV interviews, documentaries, and his memoir, \"Spare.\"\n\nFollowing his previous brief visit to London in February upon learning of his father's cancer diagnosis, Harry expressed hope on \"Good Morning America\" that the family's shared concern for Charles's health might pave the way for reconciliation.\n\nIn London for the commemorative events of the tournament he established for wounded service members and veterans, Harry continues to prioritize his philanthropic efforts despite familial challenges.", "source": {"uri": "screenbox.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenBox"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aanchal_sharma@screenbox.in", "name": "Aanchal Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://screenbox.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/prince-harry-king-charles-iii-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He will not be visiting his father, King Charles III, while he's in town because Charles is unable to see him, Meghan Markle and Harry's rep confirmed to Page Six.\n\nTheir spokesperson said in a rare statement, \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry visited his father briefly in February after Charles shared his cancer diagnosis. He returned to his home in Montecito, California, 24 hours later. Meghan is not joining Harry on his visit to London this week either.\n\nSince he and Meghan stepped back from their senior working royal family roles in 2020, the relationship between them and the royal family has been strained.\n\nIn arguably further proof of that distance, earlier today, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles is handing over Harry's military role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to his brother, Prince William, on May 13.\n\nThe royal family also quietly took down Harry and Meghan's individual bios from their website in March. Meghan and Harry now have a combined bio page that mentions their decision to step away from their working royal roles. Their children, Archie and Lilibet, had their biographies removed altogether.\n\nIn November, royal reporter Omid Scobie spoke to ELLE.com about why Meghan and Harry aren't about to imminently reconcile with William, in particular. Meghan, for her part, has stayed out of the U.K. since attending the Queen's funeral in September 2022.\n\nScobie explained that even if Harry and William were to mend their relationship someday, \"I don't think it changes Meghan's position.\"\n\n\"We've seen her in the last year really establish herself as an independent individual that is not riding on the coattails of her royal past or really even interested in being involved in that world,\" he said. \"I know her team spoke about [how] she wasn't coming over for the coronation because of Archie's birthday, but I also know from speaking with people that there was also a desire to stay away from the noise and hysteria that comes any time she sets foot near the country, let alone the family. And the way they were treated during the time of the Queen's death and the funeral really reinforced for her that she had not only made the right decision, but didn't want to go anywhere near [it] again.\n\n\"They said it loud and clear that they were looking for conversations and accountability and for people to own their roles and everything that had happened, and no one has so there is no reason for anything to change moving forward. One could argue the balls are all in the royal family's court, and we know that they're not hitting them back anytime soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "elle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omid_Scobie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omid Scobie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-prince-charles-prince-of-wales-and-news-photo-1715115966.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.651xh;0,0.154xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 1276, "textEnd": 1282}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

At his side was Queen Camilla while fellow working royals also turned out for the afternoon including Princess Anne, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Edward and Sophie, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester in a huge turn out of royals.\n\nCharles, wearing a grey suit and light blue waistcoat, could be seen smiling to the crowds as he entered the garden with the Queen. The King took off his black top hat as he observed the national anthem. The crowd gathered in the garden at Buckingham Palace cheered loudly as the song ended, leading Charles to shake his hat with joy.\n\nThe party comes as Harry will be at St Paul's Cathedral very shortly as part of his UK trip, which has seen him not have any meeting with his father. They both last met soon after the King announced his cancer diagnosis in February and Harry, who now lives with his family in California, rushed from America to see his father.\n\nIt had been hoped that on Harry's current trip to the UK, there could have been a reunion between the pair, who are known to have a frosty relationship. But spokesperson for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry and Charles' relationship had been strained during the period the duke stepped down as a working royal and moved to America with wife Meghan and their family, but after the meeting in February Harry suggested the King's cancer diagnosis could lead to a reconciliation with his father. In a Good Morning America interview, it was suggested a family illness could have a \"reunifying effect\", and when Harry was asked \"Is that possible in this case?\" he replied: \"Yeah, I'm sure.\"\n\nHarry spent Tuesday in the capital attending a summit that reflected on the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games which stages sporting events for wounded, sick or injured veterans or serving military to aid their recovery. During the service later, the duke will give a reading and actor Damian Lewis will recite the Invictus poem.\n\nThe King's appearance at the garden party today, which is to thank those for their service to communities, charities, the military and other organisations, comes after he returned to public duties last week following his cancer diagnosis earlier this year.\n\nLast week, he spoke of his 'shock' at being diagnosed with cancer as he met fellow patients during a visit to a cancer centre. Charles candidly described the experience of being told he had the disease when he visited University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in central London, to learn about the latest treatments and chat to staff providing the pioneering care. He also reassured those who asked about the state of his health, saying: \"I'm well.\"\n\nCharles' diary of events will not be a full summer programme, and attendance will be announced nearer the time and \"subject to doctors' advice\", with \"adaptations made where necessary to minimise risk\" to the King's recovery.\n\nIt is understood the warmer weather would allow events to be staged outside and lessen the risk posed by other people that many cancer patients face. A palace spokesperson added: \"The pacing of the King's programme will be carefully calibrated as his recovery continues, in close consultation with his medical team.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie,_Duchess_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Gloucester", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Gloucester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_hat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macmillan_Publishers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macmillan Publishers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32764928.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Royal-Garden-Party-at-Buckingham-Palacejpgamily.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

In a second blow, just hours later, the King announced a ceremony to celebrate his son William taking charge of Harry's former helicopter regiment next week. It was officially confirmed that William would take charge in August 2023.\n\nHarry, 38, arrived in the UK from California on Tuesday, May 7, but his spokesman confirmed that his dad had made him aware that he did not have time to meet up. The Prince's representative said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\"\n\nHarry arrived to take part in celebratory events marking ten years of his Invictus Games, which he founded in 2014. Meanwhile, the King was busy welcoming Fiji's Prime Minister to Buckingham Palace. Just hours later, the King confirmed that next Monday he will attend a ceremony to announce William, 41, as Colonel-in-Chief of Harry's former regiment, Army Air Corps.\n\nThe event is to take place in front of an Apache, which is the type of helicopter that Harry flew when serving in Afghanistan. The Prince of Wales, who worked as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance service between 2015 and 2017, is to take to the skies in the helicopter.\n\nThe Sun newspaper claims that Harry has been keen to meet up with his dad during his three-day trip to the UK. As the Duke of Sussex touched down on British soil, Charles, 75, was seen leaving Windsor Castle in the State Bentley while reading in the back seat.\n\nHarry, who travelled to the UK without his wife Meghan or their two children, was taken to the Honourable Artillery Company HQ in Barbican for an Invictus Games meet-up. He was all smiles after he was spotted leaving the premises at around 6 pm. Meanwhile, King Charles had been occupied meeting Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka at the Palace.\n\nAt 2 pm, the Office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed that Harry would not be able to meet his father during the trip. The spokesman said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\" Buckingham Palace did not release a statement.\n\nShortly after, it was confirmed that a ceremony will take place next Monday at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, Hants, to celebrate William taking charge of the Army

And I know she's up there, fondly keeping an eye on us. She would be a proud mother,\" reports the Mirror.\n\nHe added: \"For all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message. Service. My father's first words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday were a pledge of service. It was a pledge to continue to serve.\"\n\nSeveral social media users interpreted William's speech as a veiled dig at Harry and Meghan.\n\n\"Service Harry. Do you hear that? Not a free ride,\" one viewer commented on X (Twitter).\n\n\"SERVICE. Something Harry doesn't understand,\" another user added. When the Sussexes dropped the bombshell that they were stepping back from Royal duties, the Palace was quick to issue a formal statement.\n\nIt stated: \"Following conversations with the Duke, the Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service.\"\n\nBut Harry and Meghan weren't having any of it, clapping back with their own fiery response: \"We can all live a life of service. Service is universal.\"\n\nIt's been a whole year since the Coronation shindig, but the frosty air between Harry and the royals seems to be getting icier by the minute.\n\nHarry, who rocked up to the Coronation service but skipped out on the rest of the fanfare, is gearing up for another UK comeback to celebrate a decade of the Invictus Games.\n\nHe's set to attend the Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, May 8, where he'll step up for a reading.\n\nAll eyes are on whether he'll meet with his dad. The last time they were in the same room was when Harry made a lightning-fast return to Blighty after King Charles' cancer news broke, squeezing in a brief 45-minute catch-up during a whirlwind 24-hour stay.\n\nSources close to the situation have dismissed any possibility of a reconciliation between Harry and his elder brother, William. As quoted by The Daily Beast, confidants revealed: \"Both sides understand each other's position clearly now. William and Catherine felt completely betrayed by Harry's memoir. They don't speak to Harry and Meghan, and they are certainly not about to start when Catherine is at her most vulnerable.\"\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_thompson@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Harry Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "gemma_strong@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Gemma Strong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_Concert", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation Concert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32745236.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-ROYALS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 2389, "textEnd": 2394}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

It is also understood that none of Harry's immediate family will attend the ceremony tomorrow.\n\nThe Prince's return comes amid a tumultuous time for the royal family, who have been plagued by health troubles this year.\n\nBut the situation appears to be changing for the better and it was announced this morning that Sarah Ferguson has been given the all-clear from skin cancer.\n\nThe fifth in line to the throne returned to the UK from California today (7 May) for the first time since February to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nHe is expected to give a thanksgiving speech at a ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral in London, which organisers have said won't be attended by other members of the royal family.\n\nFormer BBC royal correspondent Michael Cole said: \"After so much bad blood, it is very difficult indeed to see any sort of reconciliation between the Sussexes and the Royal Family happening [this] week - or for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nAs reported by Page Six, none of the family are expected to attend the thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in London, which celebrates the 10th anniversary of the sporting event founded by the Duke.\n\nThe Prince is reported to be spending the evening in a London hotel after attending other Invictus-related events today.\n\nBBC royal correspondent Micheal Cole said that before the Sussex's relationship with the royals went \"badly wrong\", the firm did everything they could to welcome the former actress into their family.\n\n\"It was a rare honour when the King offered to walk her down the aisle because her father, Thomas, is estranged from her, as are most members of her family,\" he told Good Morning America. \"That was a great honour, and the late Queen went out of her way to make a friend of Doria, her mother.\n\n\"It's really hard to puzzle where it all went so badly wrong. She could not have been welcomed more into this country or the Royal Family.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 39, is here to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, which he founded back in 2014. The event celebrates the sporting abilities of wounded, injured and sick service people.\n\nThe Prince's arrival was announced by ITV News's royal editor, Chris Ship, on Twitter (X) this afternoon.\n\nShip wrote: \"[Harry] landed here ahead of his St Paul's Cathedral service tomorrow to mark 10 years of the @WeAreInvictus which he founded in 2014. He's doing some Invictus related events today.\"\n\nThe revelation was made by Penny Mordaunt, the Lord President of the Privy Council, 51, who regularly meets with the King as part of her work.\n\nHer comments come after the King returned to duty last Tuesday (1 May) after taking a step back following news of illness breaking in February.\n\n\"I think people won't be surprised to know that he's completely charming and always calm,\" Mourdant told GB News.\n\n\"And he's also got a really good sense of humour as well. But he's always asking about how things are going, particularly issues that we're dealing with in Parliament or about particular groups who he knows that are having a rough time.\n\n\"He's always asking after those people, so he cares a great deal and he's a delight to work with.\n\n\"He's very good. And I know that he would have been so pleased to get back to public duties. He would have missed it tremendously.\"\n\nThe poll found that Harry, 39, was seen in a favourable light by 29 per cent of respondents while just 25 per cent had a favourable opinion of the Duchess of Sussex, 42.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton emerged as the UK's favourite royals in the poll, with Kate, 42, beating William, 41, by a hair's breadth.\n\nThe Princess was given a favourability rating of 62 per cent while her husband was seen as favourable by 61 per cent of respondents.\n\nA further 36 per cent of people said they saw Kate as \"strongly favourable\" and 34 per cent of those surveyed put the future king into this category too.\n\nThe youngster turned five yesterday (6 May) and royal expert Tom Quinn speculated about the simple gift he would receive from the Monarch - a card and present.\n\n\"There has even been talk that he will send one of his own watercolour paintings to Archie as a present as Meghan loves homemade gifts and dislikes extravagant expensive presents,\" Quinn told The Mirror.\n\nPrince Archie is currently sixth in line to the throne after his father.\n\n12:00 , Emma Guinness\n\nA royal expert has said Prince Harry should be a \"guest of honour\" as he returns to the UK for the first time since February.\n\nMark Dolan said the Prince's visit, which is to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, presents an opportunity for the family to \"find a way back for Harry\".\n\nThe royal expert believes that the Prince's strained relationship with his family could begin to be repaired if they make him a \"guest of honour\" on this week's trip.\n\n\"In families as in friendships, I think you should have forgiveness. I think Harry should be staying at Buckingham Palace,\" Dolan said.\n\n\"He should be a guest of honour. He should have more than a blink and you will miss it with his father, who let's not forget is battling cancer.\"\n\nAn investigation was launched by a think tank group after the Prince, 39, admitted to using a range of substances, some as recently as 2016.\n\nHis application is now being reviewed in private to ascertain whether or not he lied about his usage.\n\nFollowing the private review, a decision will be taken about whether or not to make the documents public.\n\nHarry wrote: \"Psychedelics did me some good as well. I'd experimented with them over the years, for fun, but now I'd begun to use them therapeutically, medicinally. They didn't simply allow me to escape reality for a while.\"\n\nThe Duchess of York, 64, shared her good news via her daughter, Princess Beatrice, 35, who praised her mum today (7 May) on this morning for the resilience she showed during her cancer battle.\n\n\"She's such a phenomenal icon. As a mum, she's been amazing. She's been through so much and her sense of purpose and resilience really keeps me going,\" Beatrice said.\n\nFergie was diagnosed with skin cancer after undergoing reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy to treat the breast cancer she was diagnosed with last summer.\n\nAnnouncing her second cancer diagnosis in January, she thanked the public for their well wishes and said she remained in \"good spirits\".\n\n\"Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock, but I'm in good spirits and grateful for the many messages of love and support,\" she wrote on Instagram at the time.\n\n10:54 , Emma Guinness\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has never made a secret of his disdain for the press and this was reflected in the statement he and Meghan Markle issued after Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace,\" the couple said.\n\nAccording to reports, despite living in California, when Prince Harry learned of the King's cancer diagnosis, he immediately jumped on a plane to visit his father.\n\n\"I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could,\" Harry told Good Morning America at the time. \"I love my family.\"\n\n10:48 , Emma Guinness\n\nPrince Harry will stay at a hotel when he returns to the UK and not a royal residence despite being fifth in line to the throne.\n\nThis has been customary for the Duke of Sussex since he stepped down as a senior working royal with his wife Meghan Markle in 2020.\n\nThe Prince's last official residence was Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.\n\nFollowing the couple's decision to step down as working royals, they repaid the \u00a32.5m of public funds spent on its renovation.\n\nThe annual Sovereign Grant report from 2023 showed that the property remains vacant.\n\n10:39 , Emma Guinness\n\nPrince Harry's imminent return to the UK will be his first time stepping on British soil since Kate Middleton announced her cancer diagnosis in March.\n\nIt is not known whether Harry, 39, who was previously close to the Princess of Wales, 42, has plans to meet her on this trip, but royal expert Ingrid Seward said it is \"unlikely\".\n\n\"If the King asks, she will do it,\" Seward told The Mirror, \"but Charles being the sensitive and understanding soul he is, would be unlikely to ask such a favor from his adored daughter-in-law.\n\n\"The time must be right, and it is not right now.\"\n\nSeward also said that a meeting with his estranged brother would likely be the last thing Prince William, 41, wants at this difficult time for his family.\n\n\"William has enough going on and doesn't need the stress,\" the royal expert said. \"But he might realise Harry will want to see Kate after her cancer diagnosis as they were once so close.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If he doesn't, then we can deduce that their relationship is terminally damaged and I don't think that's the case.\n\n\"In a sensible world, Harry would stay with his dad at Clarence House - they could have cosy chats in perfect privacy and with all the security Harry wants. But, for whatever reason, that may not happen. I'm sure, though, that they will try to meet for longer than the half an hour or so during his flying visit after the King's diagnosis.\"\n\nReflecting on the position of the estranged brothers, Jennie describes their relation ship as 'terminally damaged.'\n\nShe said: \"As regards to William, that does appear to be a terminally damaged relationship. In a way, it seems the boot is now very much on the other foot. Previously it was Harry who was the 'victim' looking for an apology for all his perceived grievances.\n\n\"Now those grievances must seem utterly trivial, even to Harry, in the face of a very real problem: cancer. Catherine and William are involved in a frightening fight and I don't think they have the will or the strength to confront someone, even a brother, who picked a fight over issues that seem pathetic by comparison.\n\n\"William is doing everything he possibly can to protect his wife and I very much doubt that they want to deal with 'the Harry problem' right now, if ever.\"\n\nHarry will be in the UK until Thursday where he will fly directly to Nigeria to reunite with the Duchess of Sussex as they have been invited to visit the country. While there, they are expected to meet military staff during the trip, which is linked to the Invictus Games.\n\nJennie's comments come after The Mirror reported that while the Duke of Sussex will manage to fit in a meeting with his father on his return to London, he is not expected to see his brother, the Prince of Wales, despite wishing to, as \"now is not the time.\"\n\nA source told the publication: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nA source told the paper: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can.

He is due on a visit to Cornwall in southwest England, and the Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWilliam's wife Catherine is also undergoing cancer treatment and has not made any public appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.\n\ngmo-phz/jm\n\nMore from this section\n\nBoy Scouts of America changing name to more inclusive Scouting America after years of woes

Despite intense speculation, his wife Meghan Markle - and their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet - did not accompany him on the trip. Harry is due to give a speech at the event at St. Paul's Cathedral in London on Wednesday, but no other members of the Royal Family are due to attend the service.\n\nAs he landed in the UK, Harry unexpectedly released a statement announcing his plans for his visit home as he revealed he would not be meeting his father King Charles.\n\n\"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" a spokesperson for the Sussexes confirmed. \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nLater that day, during an event in London, Harry said he would be meeting close pal Guy Monson that evening, and told the audience: \"We're having dinner at his place later so he'll definitely be there.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry and Charles 'still have gulf between them' as King 'snubs' son on UK visit\n\nPR expert Jane Owen believes that Harry's decision to lay bare his plans while on his brief trip to London was to \"send a message\" to his estranged family that he had no intention of disrupting his busy schedule to accommodate them. \"I would say that Harry is by now an expert on communication. He knows that every single thing he says will be picked apart by the media and the public, just like we are doing now,\" she told The Mirror.\n\n\"Therefore it's definitely not an accident that his dinner plans were mentioned. I would guess that he wanted to send the message that he's busy and has plans and that they are to do with his work. It could be directed towards his father or Meghan to show his independence or even just in general to indicate a productive busy schedule to the world at large,\" Jane explained.\n\nHis decision to swerve a meeting with his family comes just weeks after he claimed he would be visiting his father after his emergency trip to see Charles in February when his cancer diagnosis was made public.\n\nHe travelled to London, met with his father at Clarence House, and then stayed overnight in a hotel before jetting back to Los Angeles the following day. Just after his visit, he told ABC News that he hoped to return to London soon, and added: \"I've got other trips planned that will take me through the UK, or back to the UK, and so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nFor the latest breaking news and top stories, visit our homepage\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

And I know she's up there, fondly keeping an eye on us. She would be a proud mother\".\n\nHe emphasized the core value of service, noting, \"For all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message. Service. My father's first words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday were a pledge of service. It was a pledge to continue to serve.\"\n\nThe speech sparked reactions on Twitter, with several users interpreting it as a pointed remark towards Harry and Meghan. One tweet read: \"Service Harry. Do you hear that? Not a free ride.\", reports the Daily Record.\n\n\"SERVICE. Something Harry doesn't understand,\" one critic remarked.\n\nFollowing the Sussexes' decision to step back from Royal duties, Buckingham Palace released a statement about their departure.\n\nThe statement from the Palace read: \"Following conversations with the Duke, the Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service.\"\n\nYet, Harry and Meghan quickly countered with a statement of their own, stating: \"We can all live a life of service. Service is universal.\"\n\nA year after the Coronation events, the divide between Prince Harry and the Royal family seems to have widened further.\n\nPrince Harry, who was present at the Coronation service but missed other celebrations, is due to return to London soon to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nHe's expected to attend a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Wednesday, May 8, where he's slated to deliver a reading.\n\nIt is very unlikely he will see his father during this trip. Their last meeting was fleeting, lasting just 45 minutes when Harry made a quick trip back to the UK after the King's cancer diagnosis was announced in February, spending only a single day in Britain.\n\nSources close to the Royal family have ruled out any chance of a reconciliation between Prince William and his brother, Prince Harry.\n\nInsiders revealed to The Daily Beast: \"Both sides understand each other's position clearly now.

While it was rumoured that he may visit King Charles and make a move in repairing their fractured relationship, it has since come out that they will not be meeting up, citing Harry's busy schedule as the reason.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with The Mirror, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams insists that this will be seen as a \"snub\", but Harry and Meghan have already made a plan to \"cover\" for this \"setback\".\n\nRead more: William and Kate 'going through hell' amid cancer battle says 'heartbroken' family designer\n\n\"Meghan has wisely decided that a hostile press and public would prefer her to stay away from the Service at St Paul's to commemorate a decade of Invictus.

During this trip, they are expected to meet with Service members and participate in various cultural activities.\n\nFitzwilliams also added that while Harry and Meghan have a game plan for redemption, that doesn't soften the blow of his father's \"snub.\"\n\n\"This will be seen as a snub. There is little doubt that this was not arranged as it should have been as King Charles has always made it clear that his door is open to Harry,\" he told us.\n\nThe last time Harry and Charles have seen each other was when Charles was diagnosed with cancer and Harry quickly flew out to see him.\n\n\"Their meeting after the King's diagnosis was extremely brief and we do not know how well it went,\" Fitzwilliams explained.\n\nDespite Charles' condition, Fitzwilliams claims he understands the impact of this decision will be significant.\n\nHe explained: \"The King has engagements and duties he needs to perform and has to balance these with treatment for cancer that must be deeply debilitating. The fact that they will not be meeting will, as all things affecting the royal family will, be worldwide news. If the royal rift is ever to be healed it will be when matters are less public and can be considered privately and less stressfully.\"\n\nAs for Harry's brother, Prince William, Fitzwilliams knew the chance of them meeting was even slimmer.\n\n\"There was never a chance of him seeing William, who does not trust him, and with good reason,\" he shared.\n\nWhile there are plenty of obstacles, Fitzwilliams does believe there is a path to redemption for Harry and Meghan.\n\nHe stated: \"If they were to mention the Commonwealth, of which it is a member, in a favourable light in a speech, this would be positive. They trashed the institution, Queen Elizabeth's most important legacy, in their documentary Harry and Meghan. This was not well received as, when they were senior working royals, they were Commonwealth patronages by the late Queen.\"", "source": {"uri": "rsvplive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "rsvp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fitzwilliams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Fitzwilliams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32739590.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Duke-Duchess-Of-Sussex-Visit-Sussex.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

He is due on a visit to Cornwall in southwest England, and the Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWilliam's wife Catherine is also undergoing cancer treatment and has not made any public appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He can't be trusted. I think King Charles is vulnerable. He might say something about his health.\"\n\nLevin's apprehension stems from the delicate nature of the King's health and the strained relationship with his son. Despite the familial tensions, Levin acknowledged, \"Nobody really wants to see him. King Charles will, because he's his father, and fathers love their children even if they go off and behave badly.\"\n\nThe complexity of the situation was evident when Prince Harry made a brief 24-hour visit to London following the announcement of King Charles' diagnosis.\n\n\"I can't see how it can happen in the time he's here. Last time he was here very quickly and was rushed out.

The timing of the event presents a logistical challenge, as Levin pointed out: \"This time it's going to be particularly awkward because the service at St Paul's Cathedral is going to finish at 6 p.m., which is exactly the time that the first garden party of the year, which King Charles is going to, also finishes at 6 p.m.\"\n\n\"You can imagine Charles is vulnerable because he will go around shaking hands with goodness knows how many people who are coming,\" Levin added.\n\nHowever commentator Michael Cole shared with GB News, \"It's good news for the King. The doctors are happy with the way the treatment is going, and he's returning to more public-facing duties, which I know is what he wants to do. Of course, there is the Harry problem. He's coming next week for the 10th-anniversary service of Thanksgiving at Saint Paul's Cathedral.\"\n\n\"I think it will be a key moment because we will see whether the King will receive his son.\"\n\nFollowing the cancer announcement, Prince Harry mentioned to Good Morning America that he had \"more trips planned,\" leaving the possibility of a reunion open.\n\nALSO READ| Prince Archie's birth announcement video resurfaces as young royal turns 5\n\nCole concluded with a hopeful note on the King's willingness to welcome his son: \"I think he will see him. I think there's a good possibility that he will be in town. The King has other duties. And he has always made it clear that his door remains open to his youngest son. The prodigal is always welcome at home. Of course, he has to be contrite, and he has to ask for forgiveness beforehand, but the King will do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/07/1600x900/download_1698375225870_1715052161701.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 172}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The plan had originally been put in place after the King took the throne in August 2023.\n\nIt comes after King Charles' busy schedule threw a spanner in the works for meeting his son Harry this week. Harry landed in UK earlier today and has been spotted at an Invictus Games commitment, ahead of the main ceremony in St Paul's cathedral on Wednesday, celebrating 10 years of the project.\n\nSources revealed last week that the monarch very much hoped to see Harry during his visit, diary permitting, but the duke's team has since confirmed that won't be happening.\n\nPrince Harry returned to the UK today\n\nA spokesperson said: \"It, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\"\n\nDespite the fresh blow, there was one sign Harry remains hopeful. The second part of the statement noted that the duke \"hopes to see him [Charles] soon,\" hinting that the door is still open for the King.\n\nPrince William will take over as Commander-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps\n\nThe last time the pair were together was shortly after Charles' cancer diagnosis had been announced when Harry rushed back to his home country to see his father in person. The duke only saw his father for 30 minutes before Charles returned to Sandringham to get some rest, having begun his cancer treatment as an outpatient.\n\nCharles has recently been cleared by his doctors to return to some public-facing duties, after a period of being limited to working behind closed doors on business of state - something that his nephew Peter Phillips has noted left the monarch \"frustrated\".\n\nWhile Charles's diary will \"remain subject to doctors' advice\" and the monarch isn't expected to be at full steam when it comes to working over the summer, his medical team is \"sufficiently pleased\" with his progress to allow the King to get back to official engagements.

I am deeply aware of this great inheritance and of the duties and heavy responsibilities of sovereignty which have now passed to me.\"\n\nCharles' coronation was held eight months later at Westminster Abbey and both of his sons with late ex-wife Princess Diana, Prince William and Prince Harry, attended alongside the king's other relatives. Charles' wife, Queen Camilla, was blessed and anointed as queen during the ceremony.\n\nRevisit Every Stunning Photo From King Charles III's Coronation\n\nAs we reach the first anniversary of Charles' crowning ceremony, look back with Us below at the royals' biggest moments of the year:\n\nMay 2023\n\nHarry returned home to California, where he lives with wife Meghan Markle and their two children, one day after Charles' coronation. Nearly one week later, Harry and Meghan traveled to New York City for Ms. Foundation's 2023 Women of Vision Awards with her mother, Doria Ragland. Following the ceremony, the couple were involved in a near-catastrophic car chase for two hours.\n\nA source told Usthat Harry, Meghan and Ragland \"were terrified throughout the whole ordeal.\"\n\nJune 2023\n\nTrooping the Colour is the annual celebration of the monarch's birthday. The June outing marked the first time the military flypast honored Charles. He watched the festivities from the Buckingham Palace balcony with Camilla and William, as well as William's wife, Princess Kate Middleton, and their three kids. Harry, Meghan and their kids, Prince Archie and Princess Lilbet, did not attend.\n\nCharles' actual birthday fell in November and a source told Us that Harry and Meghan sent him a video message from their children. (Harry has been estranged from his father since 2020 when he stepped down as a senior working royal.)\n\nDecember 2023\n\nHarry scored a major legal victory in his lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers with a judge ruling that the media organizations had engaged in \"unlawful information gathering,\" such as phone hacking between 1996 and 2011.\n\nWeeks later, Harry's relatives stepped out at their annual Christmas morning church service. William and Kate had brought all three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nJanuary 2024\n\nAfter the winter holidays, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles underwent a prostate procedure. Around the same time, Kate had a planned abdominal surgery and canceled all of her public-facing duties to recuperate.\n\nA Timeline of Kate Middleton's Cancer Battle: Surgery, Chemo and More\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nThe palace revealed that Charles had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Within days, Harry jetted overseas to visit his dad.\n\n\"I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that,\" the Duke of Sussex said on Good Morning America later that month.\n\nAt the same time, public curiosity in Kate's well-being grew rampant. Royal watchers speculated about her surgery recovery after noticing that Christmas 2023 was her last outing pre-surgery save for a few grainy paparazzi photos. William, meanwhile, continued to appear at his scheduled outings. He attended the BAFTAs solo, where he apologized for Kate's absence.\n\nKate Middleton and More Royals Who Were Diagnosed With Cancer\n\nMarch 2024\n\nIn an attempt to soothe royal fan concern, Kate shared a family photo with her and William's three kids on the U.K.'s Mother's Day. The portrait was immediately flagged for image manipulation and pulled by several news agencies. Within hours, the Princess of Wales apologized for the confusion and noted that she had played around with photo editing software as an \"amateur photographer.\"\n\nAs Kate returned to her private recovery, William carried on with his duties. He supported the Diana Legacy Awards later that month, named for his late mother, alongside estranged brother Harry. William presented trophies in person, while Harry sent in a prerecorded video message from California.\n\nOn March 22, Kensington Palace revealed that Kate had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer and would undergo a preventive round of chemotherapy.\n\n\"I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal in my mind, body and spirit,\" she said in a video message. \"Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too, as is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you.\"\n\nAmid her treatment, she and William opted against attending the royals' annual Easter service. Charles, meanwhile, went to the Windsor religious service with Camilla and his three siblings, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.\n\nApril 2024\n\nAs Charles and Kate continued their treatment in April, they had plenty of milestones to celebrate. Both of their respective wedding anniversaries took place, as well as Louis' 6th birthday. Each occasion warranted the release of a new or previously unseen portrait.\n\nCharles then made his first public appearance since his health scare on April 30, joining Camilla for a walkabout at a local London cancer treatment facility.\n\nAcross the pond, Harry and Meghan have been bolstering their business slate. Under their Netflix deal, news broke in April that they were producing a cooking series starring Meghan and a docuseries about the world of professional polo. Meghan also launched her American Riviera Orchard product line, dropping off samples of its strawberry jam to her California-based celebrity friends.\n\nMay 2024\n\nWith Charles and Kate taking a step back from their duties amid cancer treatments, the regent enlisted Camilla, William, Anne, Edward and his wife, Duchess Sophie, to step out on his behalf. Sophie, for her part, became the first working royal to visit Ukraine since the unrest.\n\n\"She really gets on with the job, she connects very well with people on these engagements that she does, and she does a lot of them behind the scenes,\" royal commentator Afua Hagan told Us. \"Now, we're seeing Prince Edward stepping out in his own way as well.\"\n\nDays later on May 2, William and Kate's daughter turned 9 years old. To mark the occasion, a new photo of Charlotte that Kate had taken was released via social media.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors":

He is due on a visit to Cornwall in southwest England, and the Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWilliam's wife Catherine is also undergoing cancer treatment and has not made any public appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.

Because, according to others, it is another general expression of support for duty as a higher obligation.\n\nHowever, many in Britain comment on this double blow from Charles.\n\nThe first strike came at midday and was revealed by Prince Harry's spokesman. Shortly after the prince's arrival in London, his spokesman revealed that he would not meet his father due to his busy schedule.

The fact that the king did not see his youngest son, Prince Harry, even though the distance between the two men was three kilometers, indicates the depth of the bay.\n\nThe \"prodigal son\" is not welcome - at least for now. Prince Harry certainly sees it for what it is, which is the clearest and strongest indicator of the pain he has caused.

It's to send a deliberate message to Harry that the Royal Family has not forgotten what has been happening over the last four years.\"\n\nThe expert said it tracks back to when Prince Philip was in hospital - and the Sussexes' explosive Oprah interview was broadcast to the world.\n\nRichard continued: \"Prince Philip was King Charles's father - he hasn't forgotten that.\n\n\"That is just one very, very significant episode, because Oprah did enormous damage to the Royal Family and the Sussexes, as I say, knew exactly what they were doing.\"\n\nThe expert said the King's decision to announce his plan with Wills just hours after snubbing Harry was an extra dig.\n\nRichard continued: \"The facts are that he has an important link with the regiment, and the facts are also that there's a ceremony next Monday which the King and the the royals do nothing by accident.\n\n\"There's no question that it was meant to be a message to Harry. It's been timed for now, quite deliberately.\n\n\"This rift is river deep and very, very public now.\"\n\nThe expert said going forward, Harry should keep his plans - and meetings with the King - private, rather than announcing them to the world - as he did on Good Morning America.\n\nRichard continued: \"I don't think that the King wanted Harry to go on television and talk even in general terms, about the family coming together.\n\n\"This was not only a private meeting, but had Harry kept it completely private and not made any comments, I think that would have been preferable.\"\n\nIt comes as The Sun's Royal Photographer revealed he believed there was a way Harry could guarantee a meeting with his dad on his next visit to the UK.\n\nArthur Edwards also claimed the King could have found time - but he didn't want to.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex jetted in from California yesterday for a service marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nArthur told The Sun: \"It's a great triumph that the King is back at work now and back to the grindstone.\n\n\"Obviously his time is packed and there's so many things to catch up on.\n\n\"But I'm sure if he wanted to he could have found time to see Harry, but obviously doesn't want to and Harry seems to have accepted it.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jane_matthews@thesun.ie", "name": "Jane Matthews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/newspress-collage-mozza6p7u-1715173655308.jpg?1715178514&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

What started it, they claim, is the king's cancer diagnosis. (The 75-year-old began treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer in February 2024.) Although they expect there's \"still hurt on both sides.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is turning a corner with his father, King Charles. According to U.K.-based royal commentator Afua Hagan, not only \"should\" the two meet when Harry's in England on May 8, 2024, for a service at St. Paul's Cathedral, marking 10 years of the Invictus Games, but the drama is behind them.\n\n\"They definitely should [meet],\" Hagan told Newsweek. \"I think it would be nice for them to spend some time together post the king's cancer diagnosis.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace announced the king's diagnosis following his hospital stay for an enlarged prostate. Just weeks later, in March 2024, news of Kate Middleton's own cancer diagnosis became public.\n\n\"I always say health is a great leveler, it's really good at bringing people together,\" she continued. \"If both parties can make time, it would be great for them to have that time together.\"\n\nHarry previously remarked in February 2024 that illnesses could unify families shortly after flying to England to see King Charles for a brief visit following his diagnosis.\n\n\"When Harry was here just after the king's diagnosis, it was quite a quick meeting, so hopefully, this time around, the king will have more time, and they can spend some time together,\" Hagan said. \"It will be good for them.\"\n\n\"I think they're probably further past the conflict than we think they are. There's obviously still issues there, and there's probably still hurt on both sides, but like I said, health is a great leveler.\"\n\nSome reports suggest Harry may get together with his father in London after the anniversary service ends (via Daily Mail). Meanwhile, Meghan Markle is not expected to join Harry in England. Instead, she's expected to be traveling to Nigeria, where Harry will meet her after the Invictus anniversary.\n\n\"When things like this happen, people are quite good at putting things behind them,\" Hagan continued. They may adopt a \"'Life is too short'\" attitude and begin \"looking to the future and thinking 'where is the way forward from here.'\"\n\nKing Charles returned to public duties on April 29, 2024, 11 weeks after putting them on pause during his treatment, which is still ongoing.\n\n\"I think the king's cancer diagnosis is giving them both an opportunity to draw a line under things that have happened in the past,\" the commentator said of King Charles and Harry. \"I don't necessarily think there's been a big reckoning, and one person's said, 'I'm wrong, no, I'm wrong.'\"\n\nShe concluded: \"I think this has just given them a good excuse to just move on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, when asked about trust being restored between the father and son, royal author and commentator Robert Jobson told the publication: \"I doubt it.\"\n\nIt seems no hours-long conversations are about to happen between Harry and King Charles. Per an Express report, sources close to the royal family claim that if a meeting does take place, it'll be brief because of King Charles's busy schedule. (He has a weekly audience with Britain's Prime Minister and Buckingham Palace's first garden party of the year.)\n\n\"Health permitting, the king is due to attend the garden party at Buckingham Palace on May 8,\" the source said. \"If a meeting with Harry were to take place, it would have to be just before or after that.\"\n\nNo \"special arrangements\" would be made. Rather, some time together would \"be squeezed into plans already in place.\"\n\n\"Harry is really trying to repair the damage that has been caused over the past few years,\" the source said. But his family is \"like any other family deep down, and it is hard for them to welcome someone back into the fold who has caused them so much pain and upset. Only time will tell.\"\n\nMeanwhile, according to The Mirror, when Harry reached out to ask about a meeting, his father gave a \"four-word response,\" saying he'll do so \"if he is able.\"", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mandi_kerr@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Mandi Kerr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prostate cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/King-Charles-and-Prince-Harry-who-are-likely-further-past-the-conflict-per-a-commentator-in-2022.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 3533, "textEnd": 3538}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The 75-year-old monarch, who has not disclosed the type of cancer he has, was also reportedly keen to mark the day with minimal \"fuss\" given the link between his accession and the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who crowned King Charles a year ago at Westminster Abbey, praised his \"sense of duty\".\n\n\"The past year has presented the king with some great personal challenges. But I have been struck by his continued sense of duty, having recently returned to royal engagements following treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"His openness in sharing his condition has been characteristic of his willingness to help and support others,\" he added. The anniversary comes as an Ipsos poll for the Daily Mail saw King Charles's personal popularity rating rise slightly to 56 per cent.\n\nHis son and heir, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, were the most popular members of the royal family on 69 per cent each, up 8-10 per cent since last April.\n\nDouble blow\n\nCatherine, 42, also known as Kate, announced her own shock cancer diagnosis in late March following abdominal surgery, which had already forced her to withdraw from public life.\n\nThe double blow of both Charles's and Catherine's ill health has left the royal family facing a shortage of frontline royals, with William also stepping back for a while to help care for his wife and family.\n\nQueen Camilla, 76, stepped in to take over many of her husband's engagements, while King Charles's sister, Princess Anne and his youngest brother, Prince Edward, have also taken on more prominent roles.\n\nBut King Charles and Catherine's absence was felt even more keenly as the king's younger son Harry is no longer a working royal.\n\nHarry dramatically relocated to North America in 2020 with his wife, Meghan Markle. Harry will return to the UK this week to attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games for disabled military veterans.\n\nThe domestic PA agency reported that he was \"likely to be reunited with (King) Charles\" at some point during his visit.\n\nALSO READ | Harry and Meghan's Nigerian visit: Roots inspire royal visit and future Invictus Games glory\n\nA demonstration organised by the anti-monarchy group Republic on Sunday, meanwhile, attracted around 100 people in Trafalgar Square.\n\nProtesters shouted \"abdicate, abdicate,\" and two large banners reading \"abolish the monarchy\" and \"change (the) country for good\" were hung in front of an art gallery.\n\nLast year's coronation saw tens of thousands of people line the streets of London and street parties held up and down the country. Television images of the historic ceremony at Westminster Abbey were beamed around the world.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "21-gun salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Welby", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Welby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trafalgar Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/11089/e8b10c01a4e640faa42924349cb04ab5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

but he didn't want to.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex jetted in from California yesterday for a service marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nArthur told The Sun: \"It's a great triumph that the King is back at work now and back to the grindstone.\n\n\"Obviously his time is packed and there's so many things to catch up on.\n\n\"But I'm sure if he wanted to he could have found time to see Harry, but obviously doesn't want to and Harry seems to have accepted it.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jane_matthews@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Jane Matthews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fitzwilliams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Fitzwilliams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/newspress-collage-mozza6p7u-1715173655308.jpg?1715177282&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Currently thousands of miles away in California, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are attempting to be \"super respectful\" of Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton's space as the Princess of Wales continues treatment following her cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"The Duke and Duchess [of Sussex] want to be super respectful and don't want to add stress to the situation,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"If Will and Kate want their space, Meghan and Harry will give it to them.\"\n\nKate first revealed her cancer diagnosis in March. After Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that the princess underwent a \"planned abdominal surgery\" and would remain \"in the hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery,\" the princess shared in a March 22 video that \"tests after the operation found cancer had been present.\" She did not reveal what type of cancer she had been diagnosed with, but shared that her \"medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\"\n\nHer diagnosis came amid a highly-reported years-long rift. The two couples have notably been at odds for some time now and have had a tense relationship ever since Harry and Meghan's 2019 marriage. In the years since stepping down as working royals and moving to the U.S., where they reside with their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, Harry and Meghan have made headlines for their claims against the royal family, notably taking part in their tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey and Harry publishing his scathing memoir Spare in January 2023.\n\nDespite the strain on their relationship, the Wales and Sussexes have maintained pleasantries, with Harry and Meghan sharing in a statement with Entertainment Tonight following Kate's diagnosis, \"we wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.\" But it seems that Kate's cancer diagnosis is putting \"things into perspective\" for the two couples, who may well be on their way to making amends.\n\nA second source told Us Weekly that William and Kate \"want a relationship with Meghan and Harry and they don't want the acrimony to carry over to the next generation\" and hope that their children - Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6 -can eventually have a relationship with their cousins. The source said the couple wants \"to mend fences with them for the kids' sake,\" with the outlet's first source stating that Harry and Meghan \"obviously\" want their two children to have a relationship with their cousins.\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George,_Duke_of_Kent", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince George, Duke of Kent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/11/04/73fa1b2a-beda-4223-85e0-e9232a509108/prince-william-kate-middleton-meghan-markle-prince-harry.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-17", "textStart": 796, "textEnd": 803}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-22", "textStart": 996, "textEnd": 1004}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

In theory, his father, King Charles (75 years old), should represent him, although he has moved his primary residence to the United States of America.\n\nHowever, it is clear that the position of State Counselor cannot be taken away from him so easily. Charles could take on Prince Harry according to Mail Online He cannot be removed from the position of \"State Counselor\" unless he consults Parliament. The newspaper also reported, citing experts, that the Duke of Sussex cannot resign from his position as MP. This means that Prince Harry can still technically represent the monarch when he is on an official trip abroad or when he is ill. Charles is currently being treated for cancer and does not perform any official public duties.\n\nThe people who can currently represent the King as \"counselor of state\" are his wife Queen Camilla (76 years old), as well as the first four adults in line to the throne who are at least 21 years old. These will be the heirs to the throne, Prince William (41 years old), his cousin Princess Beatrice (35 years old), her father Prince Andrew (64 years old), who was disgraced due to his scandals, and Harry, who has lived in the United States since then. 2020.\n\nConstitutional expert Craig Prescott told Mail Online there could be rapid change if Buckingham Palace turns to Parliament over Harry. Similar to 2022, when the change regarding \"advisers\" was approved. At that time, King Charles added Princess Anne, 73, and Prince Edward, 60, to the list of royals who could represent him.\n\nControversy has arisen over whether Harry could be a Counselor of State again as it has now been revealed that official documents show that he has now moved his primary residence to the USA. Harry lives with his wife, Duchess Meghan (42), and their children - Prince Archie (4) and Princess Lilibet (2) - in Montecito, California.\n\nNow published documents from the UK Commercial Registry Companies Office for Harry's travel organization Travalyst, which was founded in 2019, list the US as the place where he is \"usually resident\". Previously, the UK was the main place of residence. The date of change for Harry dates back to June 29, 2023.

It would seem that his father feels rather similar about the prospect of seeing his errant son, and it has been briefed that, although Harry is in London to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, there will be no meeting between Charles and the Duke of Sussex on this occasion, despite or perhaps because of the recent good news that the King's cancer treatment is proceeding positively.\n\nThe story that was briefed on behalf of Harry was that his father had a full 'diary of commitments and various other priorities' and that 'in response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.' It has been said that Harry 'is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nNonetheless, both seasoned royal watchers and those carpetbaggers who have only started to pay an interest when the familial drama has ramped up will know that if it looks like a snub, and sounds like a snub, it almost certainly is a snub. The royal family have never been much good at subtlety, and this is a clear indication that even a brief encounter between the King and Harry is neither desired nor welcome.\n\nOn its own terms, this may be understandable. Harry has, after all, seen his father once this year, dropping everything and flying to be with the King once the news of his cancer diagnosis was made public, although rumour has it that this was dictated as much by a belief that those around the monarch would not tell Harry the whole truth as it was by simple filial concern. And although Charles's diary is slowly filling up again, it will be a far cry from how busy he would have been expected to be before his illness. His doctors will have insisted that he rest between the inevitable gruelling bouts of treatment; the presence of his younger son is not wholly conducive to this, however well-intentioned it might be.\n\nThere are suggestions that the King has even gone so far as to actively snub Harry by giving Prince William his role as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps, given that the Duke, unlike the Prince of Wales, served with the Army Air Corps in Afghanistan. But Harry is no longer a working royal, and it would have seemed extraordinary for him to be given this honour, whatever the circumstances of its bestowal. Nonetheless, the King's younger son has arrived in the country at a tense and uncertain time for the monarchy; there is, of course, no suggestion that he would attempt to see his sister-in-law, given how toxic the feud between him and his brother continues to be.\n\nIt would be someone churlish who did not wish the Duke all the best for his involvement with celebrating the Invictus Games, perhaps the most wholesome aspect of his public legacy. Yet when Harry blithely said in February that 'I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can', you can only imagine a senior courtier gritting his or her teeth, and thinking about how to frustrate such an unwelcome outcome as far as they can. The news suggests that they might well have got their wish.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_larman@spectator.us", "name": "Alexander Larman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jehovah's Witnesses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carpetbagger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1252743609.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Stop making this trip about the royal family feud.\"\n\nMorgan was never a fan of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, and last week on a radio show the broadcaster advised King Charles III to move forward with caution. As reported by OK, during his most recent appearance on The Megyn Kelly Show, he said, \"They shouldn't be using the titles of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex bestowed on them by the monarchy. I hope that King Charles - who is massively distracted by his illness - will at some stage have that conversation and say, 'You can't keep the titles. I'm sorry.'\" Charles' health has, meanwhile, alarmed his family and well-wishers.\n\nEarlier, a source informed The Daily Beast, \"Of course, he is determined to beat it and they are throwing everything at it. Everyone is staying optimistic, but he is really very unwell. More than they are letting on.\"\n\nThe cancer diagnosis even made the Palace start making plans in case something happens to the King. The source revealed, \"The plans have been dusted off and are actively being kept up to date. It's no more than what you would expect given the king has been diagnosed with cancer.

The Sussexes have been very clear that Meghan and their two children, Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 2, will not make the trip overseas until security protocols have been strengthened. However, the royal family seems to be taking the Duchess of Sussex's continued absence in a very different way.\n\nThe idea that Meghan would fly to Nigeria to join Prince Harry the day after his Invictus Games event in the U.K. has some palace staffers unfairly calling out her snub. \"Her conspicuous absence from all his recent trips has been noted, a source told the Express. \"This time she will be missing a key event in Harry's Invictus diary as well as the opportunity to offer support to her father-in-law.\" Meghan probably wants to offer all of the support she possibly can to King Charles III during his cancer battle, but she and Harry have voiced their concerns about their safety, and the palace hasn't budged. The cost isn't even the issue because Harry is willing to pick up the tab so the taxpayers don't shoulder the burden.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nThe palace insider doesn't seem to care about Harry and Meghan's reasoning, though. They added, \"It strikes me as odd that she doesn't have time to come to England where however she feels about them, she does have family. But she does have time to join Harry in Africa. I think that speaks volumes.\" It probably speaks volumes about Nigeria -- they are willing and able to accommodate the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's security needs. The couple isn't making up any claims that their lives are in danger in the U.K. either.\n\nIn 2022, former Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations for the Metropolitan Police, Neil Basu, told the U.K.'s Channel 4 news that Harry and Meghan were constantly under threat when they were working for the palace. \"If you'd seen the stuff that was written and you were receiving it... the kind of rhetoric that's online, if you don't know what I know, you would feel under threat all of the time,\" he said. Basu added that the danger the couple faced was \"digesting and very real.\"\n\nThe Express is claiming that Meghan is \"done\" with the U.K. for good because she \"doesn't want the drama\" associated with the royal family. However, that doesn't have to be a permanent situation if the palace stood up for them in the British tabloids. If they address the security detail and heal the royal rift together, the U.K. may feel like a safe space again.

The former working royal who is not accompanied by his wife Meghan Markle or their children, Archie and Lilibet, joked during an Invictus summit event he would be spending the evening having dinner with former Invictus Games Foundation trustee Guy Monson.\n\nThe pair last met soon after the King announced his cancer diagnosis in February and his son, who now lives with his family in California, rushed from America to see his father. A spokesperson for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nKate Garraway forced to 'withdraw money from pension' to pay off Derek Draper's bills\n\nSue Radford's daughter Chloe in floods of tears as disaster strikes family home\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry and Charles's relationship had been strained during the period the duke stepped down as a working royal and moved to America with wife Meghan and their family, but after the meeting in February Harry suggested the King's cancer diagnosis could lead to a reconciliation with his father. In a Good Morning America interview, it was suggested a family illness could have a \"reunifying effect\", and when Harry was asked \"Is that possible in this case?\" he replied: \"Yeah, I'm sure.\"\n\nIt is thought the King has been receiving his cancer treatment as an outpatient midweek and is likely to be hosting the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season on Wednesday. The duke will also be busy attending a ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, formally marking a decade of work by the Invictus Games Foundation, which has staged the sporting tournament to aid the recovery of wounded, sick and injured veterans and serving military.\n\nWith ties between the duke and his brother the Prince of Wales also strained, it is unlikely the royal siblings will meet this week. Harry attended a one-day summit in the capital that reflected on the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, saying there is still \"so much more to do\".\n\nHe told delegates at the event, held at the Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters on the edge of the City of London: \"Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'. But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty - but what we've created is a global community.\"\n\nThe duke, who was joined onstage by Sir Keith Mills, the former Invictus Games Foundation chairman, said whenever he was asked how long Invictus will last, his reply was \"as long as it's serving a purpose\". He added: \"The root cause of the problem is conflict and I can't fix that.\n\n\"So we will always be here to be able to spread the message, tell the stories, change the perspectives and help as many people as humanly possible, because Invictus transcends borders, transcends politics.\"\n\nHarry was inspired to found the global tournament after attending the Warrior Games in Colorado in 2013 and seeing how injured American military personnel thrived on the challenge of taking part in competitive sports that aided their recovery. He went on to stage the inaugural games in London's Olympic Park in 2014 and the tournament has been held across the globe from Orlando and Sydney to Dusseldorf in 2023, with the 2025 event being hosted in Vancouver and Whistler.\n\nJohnny Mercer, minister for veterans' affairs, attended one of the final sessions of the day and praised the work of the Invictus delegates in supporting competitors, adding: \"The power of sport in recovery has been well known for a long time, but your determination to take it to the next level has been unmatched.\n\n\"I cannot adequately express to you here today the sheer power of what you have done. You have reached into the darkest recesses of their lives when they have literally nowhere else to turn, and you have transformed their existence.\n\n\"Yes, it is about sports, but then again, it's not really. It's about a common humanity. Man's conduct to fellow man - you set the standard for humility, for courage, for determination, the absolute resolve never to quit.\"", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\" However, there was still a sign that relations between the father and son had thawed somewhat, with the spokesperson adding that Harry \"hopes to see [Charles] soon\".\n\nHarry has been open about the fact that his relationship with Charles and William has been strained in recent years. The last time he saw his father was shortly after the monarch had been diagnosed with cancer when he rushed back to see him.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has also acknowledged that after stepping back from life as a working royal, he lost some long-standing friends in the process, admitting in his Netflix documentary \"I miss the UK. I miss my friends... I lost a few friends as part of this process.\"\n\nHarry's core group of friends in the UK\n\nThe Mirror takes a look at who is part of Harry's inner circle in the UK, from his \"surrogate mum\" and \"second dad\" to life-altering friendships.\n\nDuke of Westminster\n\nOne of the richest men in the UK, Hugh Grovesnor the Duke of Westminster, is friends with both William and Harry, and they've known each other for years. Hugh is due to get married this summer - and some reports say Harry hasn't been invited, because the groom is concerned that any royal drama might \"overshadow\" the big day for his bride-to-be Olivia Henson.\n\nHugh is friends with both William and Harry\n\nSources said to the Sunday Times: \"'Hugh is one of very few close friends of William and Harry's who has maintained strong bonds and a line of communication with both. He wishes they could put their heads together and patch things up, but realises it's unlikely to happen before the wedding.\n\n\"He wanted to avoid anything overshadowing the day, especially for Olivia, and doesn't want any awkwardness.\"\n\nJJ Chalmers\n\nPrince Harry and JJ Chalmers met when Harry was a captain in the Army, and JJ had suffered life-changing injuries while serving in the Royal Marines in Afghanistan. JJ has credited Harry as being one of the \"key people\" who helped him recover from his injury and turn his life around, through the Invictus Games, and the two men are always quick to support one another.\n\nIn 2020, when JJ took part in Strictly Come Dancing, Harry sent a video message of support, \"When I first met JJ he was a shell of himself but then to see you shine through Invictus and to be yourself again, that was the start of an amazing journey.\"\n\nJJ and Harry have a 'life-changing' friendship\n\nJJ is, for his part, is always quick to praise the Duke of Sussex, telling the Big Issue in 2022, \"Harry's a friend of mine and someone I dearly love and wish the best for. I wouldn't be stood here talking to you if it wasn't for him.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Not to lay all of it at his feet, but he's one of the key people who created one of the key catalysts in my recovery. For that, I'll be forever grateful.\"\n\nCharlie and Thomas von Straubenzee\n\nBrothers Charlie and Thomas von Straubenzee are friends with both William and Harry and attended the same prep school as the royals, and an early tragedy in their life tied the two sets of brothers together for life. In 2002, aged only 18 their brother - and Harry's close friend - Henry died in a tragic car accident. In 2009, William and Harry jointly became patrons of a memorial fund set up in Henry's name.\n\nThomas Straubenzee is a long time pal of William and Harry\n\nCharlie is one of Prince Archie's godparents and Harry is said to be godfather to Charlie's daughter, who also reportedly gave a speech at Harry's wedding reception in 2018\n\nMark 'Marko' Dyer\n\nMark 'Marko' Dyer played a large role in Harry's memoir Spare, as Harry describes what an important relationship he has shared over the years with the former royal aide. Marko attended his passing out parade at Sandhurst and asked Harry to be godfather to his son Jasper, something Harry called a \"deep honour\" in his memoir.\n\nPrince Harry alongside former Royal Equerry and 'second dad' Mark Dyer\n\nA longstanding mentor to Harry, he has often been dubbed a \"second dad\" to him, and Harry has called him a \"dear friend\".\n\nTiggy Pettifer\n\nTiggy Pettifer has been a core figure in Harry's life since he was a child when she worked as his nanny. Then known as Tiggy Legge-Bourke, she helped play an important role in raising both Harry and William and has been seen supporting Harry at landmark events in his adulthood - like his graduation from Sandhurst.\n\nWilliam and Harry with their nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke in 1994 at Balmoral\n\nShe is one of Prince Archie's godparents, and Harry is also godfather to her son Tom. In his memoir Spare, Harry discussed how Tiggy became a \"surrogate mum\" for him and his brother, and how their bond was so close that after he sat down with Oprah for his now-infamous interview in 2021, she \"chastised\" him for discussing his family negatively on the public stage.\n\nAdam Bidwell\n\nStockbroker Adam Bidwell was an usher at Meghan and Harry's 2018 wedding, and has been a core part of Harry's friendship circle for a long time. He has worked as an ambassador for Sentebale, one of Harry's charities, and was seen accompanying Meghan to a polo match in 2019, when Archie was very young.\n\nCharlie Gilkes\n\nCharlie Gilkes is a longstanding friend of William and Harry and co-founded the Inception Group, which owns nightclub Bunga Bunga - per Tatler - and was pictured at Harry's wedding in the thick of things with his closest friends, a snap that was revealed in the couple's Netflix documentary.\n\nNightclub owner Charlie Gilkes attended Harry's wedding Jack Mann\n\nJack and Harry both attended Sandhurst, and Jack went on to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan in the Blues and Royals. Reportedly he took on the role of \"unofficial best man\" at Harry's 2018 wedding.\n\nJack Mann is a close friend of Harry's Tom Inskip\n\nTom 'Skippy' Inskip has been a longstanding friend of Harry's since they both attended Eton College together, and his father is said to have been field master at one of King Charles's preferred hunts. During Harry's party days, Tom was a regular fixture by his side, but the royal book Finding Freedom - co-written by Omid Scobie - claimed that the pair had a falling out when Tom advised Harry to move slowly with Meghan and not rush into getting married, something that the Duke didn't appreciate. Despite this, the pair are reported to have made up since.\n\nTom Inskip and Harry are longstanding friends Lord Vivian\n\nThe Mail reports that Lord Vivian - a PR expert - was so much part of Harry and Meghan's inner circle that he even made the cut to Prince Archie's christening, and he was first introduced to Harry by his \"second dad\" Marko Dyer. The PR guru also has gone with Harry on some of his trips to Botswana, a place that became \"sacred\" to Harry over the years. In his memoir Spare the Duke of Sussex described the freedom he experienced in the country and how important his time there was to him - as he was able to just be \"Spike\" rather than known for his royal status.\n\nHenry Warhurst\n\nHenry Warhust attended Harry's wedding in 2018, and is married to the niece of the Duke's \"surrogate mum\" Tiggy Pettifer - Tamara Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax. It is understood that Tamara and Meghan became fast friends back in 2019, creating another connection between the two couples.\n\nDo you have a story to tell?

No official events, however, were planned with the milestone coming less than a week after King Charles resumed public duties since his diagnosis.\n\nHe visited fellow cancer patients at a London hospital on Tuesday after doctors said they were \"very encouraged\" by his progress. The 75-year-old monarch, who has not disclosed the type of cancer he has, was also reportedly keen to mark the day with minimal \"fuss\" given the link between his accession and the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby who crowned King Charles a year ago at Westminster Abbey praised his \"sense of duty\". \"The past year has presented the king with some great personal challenges. But I have been struck by his continued sense of duty, having recently returned to royal engagements following treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"His openness in sharing his condition has been characteristic of his willingness to help and support others,\" he added. The anniversary comes as an Ipsos poll for the Daily Mail saw King Charles's personal popularity rating rise slightly to 56 percent.\n\nHis son and heir Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Princess of Wales, were the most popular members of the royal family on 69 percent each, up 8-10 percent since last April.\n\nCatherine, 42, also known as Kate, announced her own shock cancer diagnosis in late March following abdominal surgery which had already forced her to withdraw from public life. The double blow of both King Charles and Catherine's ill health has left the royal family with a shortage of frontline royals with William also stepping back for a while to help care for his wife and family.\n\nQueen Camilla, 76, stepped in to take over many of her husband's engagements while King Charles's sister Princess Anne and his youngest brother Prince Edward have also taken on more prominent roles. But King Charles and Catherine's absence was felt even more keenly as the king's younger son Harry is no longer a working royal. P\n\nHarry dramatically relocated to North America in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle. Harry will return to the UK this week to attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games for disabled military veterans. The domestic PA agency reported that he was \"likely to be reunited with (King) Charles\" at some point during his visit.\n\nA demonstration organized by the anti-monarchy group Republic on Sunday, meanwhile, attracted around 100 people in Trafalgar Square. Protesters shouted \"abdicate, abdicate\" and two large banners reading \"abolish the monarchy\" and \"change (the) country for good\" were hung in front of an art gallery. - AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Welby", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Welby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trafalgar Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/05/06/105842.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

He was crowned alongside his wife, Queen Camilla, in London as thousands of spectators shouted, \"God save the king!\"\n\nSeveral royal experts told Fox News Digital the British monarch has been doing a stellar job keeping up with his mother's legacy. Queen Elizabeth II, England's longest-reigning monarch, died in 2022 at age 96. But as the king currently battles cancer, the drama surrounding his personal life is difficult to ignore, they argued.\n\nKING CHARLES VISITS CANCER CENTER AS MONARCH RETURNS TO PUBLIC DUTIES FOLLOWING DIAGNOSIS\n\n\"King Charles has endured a rocky time,\" British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital. \"However, he has proved himself to be a very strong, focused king... He is a huge force for good and stability... He has surprised many people who wrongly believed he would be a weak king.\"\n\nChard noted that \"despite being a strong king,\" Charles is \"highly emotional\" when it comes to his family -- especially his \"darling boy\" Prince Harry.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He finds it hard to reprimand when necessary,\" Chard alleged. \"He is sad about situations involving his darling boy Harry. He hopes his sons will not make his final years a misery and is hopeful they will sort their differences out in time.\"\n\nHarry, who has publicly sparred with the family, arrived alone for the coronation. His wife Meghan Markle and their two young children remained at home in California, where the couple has lived since quitting as working royals in 2020. The Duke of Sussex left as soon as the ceremony ended to return to the U.S. for his son's birthday.\n\n\"King Charles is saddened at the less than remote chance of any reconciliation between his sons,\" British royals expert Hilary Fordwich alleged to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"He has been consistent in remaining open to embracing Harry, but has been advised by courtiers and others to be leery of Harry's intentions,\" Fordwich claimed. \"What does cause him heartache is not seeing nor even knowing his grandchildren, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nHarry, 39, has had a troubled relationship with the royal family since he quit royal duties. According to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media prompted the move.\n\nMarkle, 42, a former American actress, became the Duchess of Sussex when she married the British prince in 2018. They now live in the wealthy coastal city of Montecito.\n\nFollowing their departure, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex aired their grievances about life as royals. In 2021, they sat down with Oprah Winfrey for an interview that was viewed by 50 million people globally.\n\nFollowing the release of a six-part docuseries on Netflix in 2022, Harry's memoir, \"Spare\" hit bookshelves in 2023, quickly becoming a bestseller. In the book, Harry alleges that his older brother Prince William, who is heir to the British throne, attacked him. He also singles out his stepmother, accusing her of leaking private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate her image after marrying Charles.\n\nCamilla, 76, was once reviled for her long-term affair with Charles, which contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to the late Princess Diana, Harry and William's mother.\n\n\"Harry's vituperative volleys thrown at her via his autobiographical whinefest 'Spare' were deeply hurtful,\" Fordwich alleged. \"[It] presented one of the greatest challenges the king faces; to embrace the very son who so bitterly bashed the love of his life.\"\n\nWilliam and Harry, who were once close, have been estranged since the Sussexes made their royal exit. During the king's coronation in May, the brothers were never seen speaking or even acknowledging each other.\n\n\"Would it help to welcome Harry and Meghan back into the royal fold, or at least make peace with them? Yes,\" Christopher Andersen, author of \"The King,\" told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"But the ball is really in the brothers' respective courts,\" he shared. \"The king can't force them to reconcile, and William simply isn't interested. All the king can do now is focus on his cancer treatment and, when possible, get out there and make himself visible.\"\n\nThe House of Windsor has been rocked by health woes following Charles' coronation.\n\nIn February, Buckingham Palace announced Charles had been diagnosed with a form of cancer and is undergoing treatment. A \"separate issue of concern\" was identified during the monarch's \"benign prostate enlargement\" procedure at the London Clinic.\n\n\"Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,\" the palace said in a statement at the time.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nIn a video shared in March, the king's daughter-in-law, Kate Middleton, revealed that she, too, is battling a form of cancer. The 42-year-old has been undergoing preventative chemotherapy treatment.\n\nFollowing the news of his father's diagnosis, Harry traveled to the U.K. to visit him. The meeting reportedly lasted less than an hour, and it's understood that the prince didn't meet with his brother, William, 41.\n\n\"King Charles III's first year on the throne has been marked by significant personal and public challenges,\" British broadcaster and commentator Jonathan Sacerdoti told Fox News Digital. \"His handling of these issues, particularly the public estrangement with his younger son, Prince Harry, has been a focal point, and more recently his own and Catherine's cancer diagnoses and treatments.\"\n\n\"We should view Charles not just through the prism of past controversies but consider his current efforts to maintain positivity amidst these adversities,\" Sacerdoti pointed out. \"Charles' approach seems to embody a balance between embracing modern royal responsibilities and managing traditional expectations. His strategies to address these dramas are critical, especially as he navigates his role in an era where the royal family's relevance is continuously scrutinized.\"\n\nSacerdoti noted that despite all the drama, the king is determined to maintain a positive persona.\n\n\"The continuing public and private disputes might continue to challenge him, and his public responsibilities and role will make it even harder to make reconciliation efforts within the family,\" said Sacerdoti. \"He may not have expected that, as king, so much of his attention would need to be diverted to adapting to the changing dynamics of public expectation and family relations.\"\n\nKING CHARLES' CANCER BATTLE HAS HIM 'DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS MARK ON HISTORY': EXPERT\n\nChard said that Charles remains hopeful that, in his lifetime, he will make peace with his younger son.\n\n\"In due course, I believe King Charles will repair his relationship with... Prince Harry,\" she said. \"King Charles struggled with his parents when younger and is mindful of this when dealing with the family upset. I also believe he will give a gentle nudge to his boys to build bridges and sort their differences for the sake of their children.\"\n\nAndersen said that the king will continue to follow his late mother's mantra -- never complain, never explain.\n\n\"Queen Elizabeth had been on the throne 40 years when she suffered her annus horribilis -- 1992, the year Windsor Castle nearly burned down and both Charles and Prince Andrew split from their wives,\" Andersen explained. \"Charles could not have imagined he would be clobbered with his annus horribilis his very first year as king.\"\n\n\"You can tell a lot about a person's character when they are forced to confront their mortality,\" Andersen continued. \"[The king is]... showing tremendous grace under pressure. In the king's case, it's sort of surprising, since, as Prince of Wales, Charles was often viewed as what the British call a 'whinger' -- a whiner. He often complained that people just didn't understand him... The King has given up complaining and is facing his current medical condition with remarkable calm.\"\n\nHOW QUEEN CAMILLA WENT FROM VILIFIED MISTRESS TO BELOVED DAUGHTER-IN-LAW\n\n\"Not that the king isn't frustrated,\" Andersen noted. \"He wants to get back to the complicated business of streamlining the monarchy. Since we don't know the king's prognosis -- the type of cancer he is battling and how far it has progressed -- it's hard to predict what lies ahead.\"\n\nOriginal article source: King Charles 'highly

BAHRAIN", "body": "AFP | London, United Kingdom\n\nThe Daily Tribune - www.newsofbahrain.com\n\nBritain's King Charles III on Monday marked the first anniversary of his coronation following a difficult year that has seen a cancer diagnosis and continuing tensions with his estranged son Prince Harry.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion a 41- gun salute rang out from Green Park next to Buckingham Palace at noon (1100 GMT), followed an hour later with 62 volleys fired from another central London location.\n\nNo official events, however, were planned with the milestone coming less than a week after King Charles resumed public duties since his diagnosis.\n\nHe visited fellow cancer patients at a London hospital on Tuesday after doctors said they were \"very encouraged\" by his progress.\n\nThe 75-year-old monarch, who has not disclosed the type of cancer he has, was also reportedly keen to mark the day with minimal \"fuss\" given the link between his accession and the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who crowned King Charles a year ago at Westminster Abbey, praised his \"sense of duty\".\n\n\"The past year has presented the king with some great personal challenges.\n\nBut I have been struck by his continued sense of duty, having recently returned to royal engagements following treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"His openness in sharing his condition has been characteristic of his willingness to help and support others,\" he added.\n\nThe anniversary comes as an Ipsos poll for the Daily Mail saw King Charles's personal popularity rating rise slightly to 56 percent.\n\nHis son and heir Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Princess of Wales, were the most popular members of the royal family on 69% each, up 8-10% since last April.\n\nDouble blow Catherine, 42, also known as Kate, announced her own shock cancer diagnosis in late March following abdominal surgery which had already forced her to withdraw from public life.\n\nThe double blow of both Charles's and Catherine's ill health has left the royal family facing a shortage of frontline royals, with William also stepping back for a while to help care for his wife and family.\n\nQueen Camilla, 76, stepped in to take over many of her husband's engagements while King Charles's sister Princess Anne and his youngest brother Prince Edward have also taken on more prominent roles.\n\nBut King Charles and Catherine's absence was felt even more keenly as the king's younger son Harry is no longer a working royal.\n\nHarry dramatically relocated to North America in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle.\n\nHarry will return to the UK this week to attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games for disabled military veterans.",

It has been announced, but very quietly.\"\n\nFitzwilliams continued: \"Some people say they want Harry because he's the beginning of the whole Invictus Games, and other people say that it would be delightful that they don't do all this nonsense and they don't want Meghan making speeches. They don't want her leading marches.\"\n\n\"She did lead people who were in winning last year, and she walked as if she was at a dress show and they were walking behind her looking very angry because she doesn't really know very much about the army and the military.\"\n\nThe expert also suggested that any hopes for reconciliation between Harry and the Royal Family seem slim, especially with Harry expected to quickly return to Meghan following the May 8 event in London.\n\nFitzwilliams remarked: \"He won't be going to see his father or brother. It's said that he won't be here for very long.\"\n\nPrince Harry is expected to make a personal appearance at an imminent event, having previously considered participating via video link due to concerns over his security.\n\nHis recent legal challenge against the Home Office regarding police protection was unsuccessful, resulting in the loss of his entitlement to Royal security services.\n\nFollowing an extensive legal dispute, his request for additional protection was denied this February.\n\nIn spite of the ongoing disputes, Harry is set to return to the UK next month to attend an event for the Invictus Games, which he founded in 2014 with the Ministry of Defence.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

But we can tell that Harry must have called his father's bluff and that's because Buckingham Palace has been leaking like a sieve ever since. Palace insiders clearly ran straight to Richard Kay at the Daily Mail to spill certain details: Harry didn't \"formally\" ask for a meeting with Charles; Harry should have come earlier in the week when Charles's schedule wasn't so full of busy-work; and finally, that Harry didn't even request to stay at a royal property during his visit. That last one is shocking, that the palace is leaking that kind of information. But that's not all - it's looks like palace insiders also ran to Charlotte Griffiths, also at the Daily Mail, with a hilarious story about how Harry told his father his terms and Charles couldn't handle it.\n\nKing Charles' decision not to meet Prince Harry during his son's UK trip this week came after a round of \"difficult\" negotiations, according to a royal expert.\n\nAccording to royal commentator Charlotte Griffiths, the monarch's decision may have been swayed by \"certain demands\" from Harry.\n\n\"There is some talk that behind the scenes, a lot of negotiating went on,\" Griffiths told GB News. \"I think the reason was because Harry made certain demands about who could be in the room and who couldn't. Although on the surface it looks like a snub, Harry made it very difficult for his father.\"\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on the demands, Griffiths said \"other forces\" could've influenced the King's decision.\n\n\"Maybe other forces were driving Charles's position on this,\" she said. \"William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all. We know that Charles likes to meet Harry with Camilla in the room which isn't always a popular decision,\" she continued. \"Harry was without his wife as well, so this was fraught with difficulty.\"\n\nThe Duke's rep on Tuesday said that a meeting between the estranged father and son duo \"will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\"\n\n[From The NY Post]\n\nLMAO - palace insiders crying about Harry telling his father that he would only meet with Charles if they could speak alone, with no Camilla in the room, no Clive Alderton, no leakers. That seemed to be Harry's terms for meeting Charles back in February too, because Camilla kicked up a HUGE fuss about how she was left out of the room (you know she was listening at the door though). It says a lot that Charles made it happen in February, probably because Harry's trip came together so quickly, but he couldn't do it this time. Camilla must have been loudly neighing her disapproval and the king's courtiers were beside themselves with worry. Can't believe they'd all tell on themselves to this level too. Oh, Harry didn't want anyone to leak a potential meeting with his father, so Camilla and the courtiers decided to leak everything about the negotiations?", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Alderton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clive Alderton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courtier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Most famously, Princess Diana wore a navy Versasce gown (and stunning pearl and sapphire choker) back in 1995, and more recently, Princess Beatrice arrived at the event in 2018 in a flowing purple gown. However, America's resident royal couple, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, have yet to make an appearance in New York City on the first Monday in May. That isn't changing this year. Town & Country can confirm that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be in attendance at the Met Gala this evening.\n\nIt's been a busy spring so far for Harry and Meghan. The Duchess of Sussex is gearing up for the launch of her new venture, American Riviera Orchard, and she revealed the brand's first product -- strawberry jam -- by mailing gift baskets to close friends. In addition, the couple confirmed they have two new Netflix projects in the works: a cooking and entertaining show hosted by Meghan, and a docuseries about the world of professional polo. Plus, a few weeks ago, they were in Florida for a charity polo match in support of Harry's Sentebale nonprofit.\n\nPrince Harry is scheduled to attend an event in London this week celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. Earlier this year, he and Meghan traveled to Canada to mark one year to go until the 2025 edition of the Games. During his remarks on the last day of the trip, he said, \"We're celebrating our 10th anniversary, our 10th birthday this year, and the journey that we have all been on with Invictus, especially with competitors and their families, it continues, it always continues.

The meeting reportedly lasted less than an hour.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex was expected to spend the rest of Tuesday in meetings connected to the Invictus Games and on Wednesday will attend a service at St Paul's Cathedral, marking the 10th anniversary of the sporting event for wounded and injured servicemen and women.\n\nBuckingham Palace has said the King's diary this week is \"busy\", according to The Daily Telegraph.\n\nThe King has meetings throughout Wednesday morning and, in the afternoon, he is expected to attend a Buckingham Palace garden party as well as his weekly meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nOn Thursday, His Royal Highness has a public engagement outside of London. He is also engaged with ongoing cancer treatment, involving regular hospital visits.\n\nPrince Harry's first engagement in London this week was at Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters where a one-day summit, called the Invictus Games Foundation Conversation, was held.\n\nIn the foreword for the summit programme, the prince wrote: \"It has been an honour to watch the Invictus Games Foundation grow over the years; what began as a vision to pay tribute to the courage and resilience of wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veterans, has flourished into an international organisation built on hope, strength, and unity.\n\n\"As we look ahead to the first winter hybrid Games at Vancouver Whistler 2025 next year, we are eager to celebrate the Invictus Spirit once again - exemplified in every single competitor, staff, friend and family member - your commitment, enthusiasm and belief, have been the driving force behind our continued success.\"\n\nHe added: \"Together, we have created a legacy that transcends sports; a community that embraces compassion, respect, and the unyielding belief in the power of the human spirit. As we celebrate this milestone, let us recommit to the Invictus mission.\"\n\nAfter his three-day visit to the UK, the duke is expected to fly to Nigeria, where he will be joined by his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex for a quasi-royal tour.\n\nSpeaking about how illness could bring families together, Prince Harry said in an interview in February: \"I love my family. And the fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see [my father] and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that,\"\n\nHe had vowed to visit him shortly after the interview, telling a US breakfast show from Whistler, Canada: \"I've got other trips planned that would take me through the UK or back to the UK, so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_rucker@inews.co.uk", "name": "Sam Rucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Highness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Highness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honourable_Artillery_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honourable Artillery Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistler, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Whistler, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SEI_190208593.jpg?crop=7px%2C0px%2C1186px%2C670px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

But I have been struck by his continued sense of duty, having recently returned to royal engagements following treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"His openness in sharing his condition has been characteristic of his willingness to help and support others,\" he added.\n\nThe anniversary comes as an Ipsos poll for the Daily Mail saw King Charles's personal popularity rating rise slightly to 56 percent.\n\nHis son and heir Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Princess of Wales, were the most popular members of the royal family on 69 percent each, up 8-10 percent since last April.\n\n- Double blow -\n\nCatherine, 42, also known as Kate, announced her own shock cancer diagnosis in late March following abdominal surgery which had already forced her to withdraw from public life.\n\nThe double blow of both King Charles and Catherine's ill health has left the royal family with a shortage of frontline royals with William also stepping back for a while to help care for his wife and family.\n\nQueen Camilla, 76, stepped in to take over many of her husband's engagements while King Charles's sister Princess Anne and his youngest brother Prince Edward have also taken on more prominent roles.\n\nBut King Charles and Catherine's absence was felt even more keenly as the king's younger son Harry is no longer a working royal.\n\nHarry dramatically relocated to North America in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle.\n\nHarry will return to the UK this week to attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games for disabled military veterans.\n\nThe domestic PA agency reported that he was \"likely to be reunited with (King) Charles\" at some point during his visit.\n\nA demonstration organised by the anti-monarchy group Republic on Sunday, meanwhile, attracted around 100 people in Trafalgar Square.\n\nProtesters shouted \"abdicate, abdicate\" and two large banners reading \"abolish the monarchy\" and \"change (the) country for good\" were hung in front of an art gallery.\n\nLast year's coronation saw tens of thousands of people line the streets of London and street parties held up and down the country.\n\nTelevision images of the historic ceremony at Westminster Abbey was beamed around the world.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That's right, Charles scheduled his coronation on his grandson's birthday and then told Prince Harry to \"choose\" between his son and father. Charles didn't even explicitly extend an invitation to Harry's wife or children for the coronation. Don't forget that Charles also evicted the Sussex family from their British home, Frogmore Cottage, several months before the coronation. Now on the one-year anniversary of the coronation, a royal expert claims that Charles is heartbroken over his lack of relationship with his Sussex grandchildren. Dear Chaz: you can't sadistically punish your son and his family and then whine about how they don't come to visit you. You made your priorities abundantly clear.\n\nToday marks one year since Charles became King and his regal Coronation was televised around the world. While the day is undoubtedly a momentous memory in his mind, the anniversary will be \"bittersweet\" for King Charles, claims a royal author. Phil Dampier claims the monarch will not only be thinking about his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, but also his grandson Archie, who celebrates his fifth birthday today.\n\nThe royal expert told Fabulous: \"It's a bittersweet day for the King when he marks the anniversary of his Coronation as it's also Archie's birthday. I'm sure it breaks Charles's heart that his grandchildren Archie and Lilibet are growing up on the West Coast with American accents and yet he hardly knows them. Harry and Meghan may arrange occasional zoom calls but it's not the same as seeing them in person.\"\n\nPhil added that King Charles is a \"doting grandad\" to Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, nine, and Prince Louis, five, but added: \"I'm sure he'd love to have the same relationship with his other two. It's a very difficult situation. Charles probably compensates for not seeing them by showering love on George, Charlotte and Louis, but obviously it would be better for all concerned if the rifts were healed and some kind of normal family relations resumed.\"\n\nPhil claimed: \"No-one knows if Harry is going to see his father [during his visit this week] but it wouldn't surprise me if he doesn't. It would surely be an opportunity for Meghan to also bring the children so they could see him, but I doubt it will happen. The King has only met Lilibet - who was named after his mother the late Queen - once, and Archie just two or three times. Of course we must not forget Meghan's father Thomas Markle, who has never met either of them, or even his son in law Harry.\"\n\n[From The Sun]\n\n\"No-one knows if Harry is going to see his father [during his visit this week] but it wouldn't surprise me if he doesn't\" - as soon as Harry confirmed his trip, Charles and the rest of the family ran around, telling everyone that they would be \"too busy\" to attend the Invictus service or meet with Harry. They've spent the past week scheduling all kinds of events so that they \"look busy\" for Harry's visit. It's hilarious and sad. The same thing would be happening on the off-chance that Meghan and the children visited too, only it would be a million times worse. Charles would make a POINT of snubbing Archie and Lili. Because let's face it, he does not care. He isn't feeling bittersweet about any of this.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogmore_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frogmore Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Markle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Markle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Will the Duke meet his brother?", "body": "Ahead of Prince Harry's anticipated return to his home country for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, King Charles has arrived in London from Windsor. Per media reports, the King is likely to sit in with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tomorrow, which also opens up the roads for his reconnection with his son.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, the monarch was spotted at Clarence House earlier today. His arrival has set the mood for his expected reunion with his estranged son, whom he last met briefly in February. Harry's former quick visit to the UK followed right after the news of the king's cancer diagnosis made headlines. In the coming hours, his arrival will pave the way for his first appearance at a major event in Britain for some time.\n\nCoincidentally, it also marks his first homecoming since the Princess of Wales came out with an update on her cancer diagnosis and that she was undergoing preventive chemotherapy in March.\n\nAs expected to address the thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral, honouring the decade-long-journey of the Invictus Games inaugurated in London in 2024, Prince Harry stepping up to the occasion is being deemed the highlight of his latest UK trip. This ceremony will follow just two days after the celebrations of Harry's son Prince Archie's fifth day, and coincidentally, the first anniversary of the King's coronation. On top of that, all eyes are on the estranged royal father-son duo's expected meeting.\n\nAlso read | Prince Harry against Prince Charles' \u00a318,000 birthday gift to Archie? Report denies claims\n\nAlthough there is no official confirmation of Meghan's status during this UK trip, it's quite likely that the Duke will be flying alone. He is later expected to join the Duchess of Sussex in Nigeria. Current reports have also stayed mum on the royal couple's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, attending the UK event.\n\nPer The Mirror, Harry's expected choice of lodging will once again be at a hotel since his renunciation of the Frogmore Cottage in Windsor upon his departure to California in 2020.\n\nAs far as his reunion with the other members of the Royal Family is concerned, there's no confirmation on whom he'll meet during his trip. The chances of Harry seeing his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton are also rather slim. The Mirror stated that the former won't be in the capital on Thursday or Friday. As for Middleton, her cancer treatment continues behind closed doors.\n\nAlso read | Met Gala throwback: Princess Diana's 'liberated' \u00a310,000 nightdress fashion statement that broke all traditions\n\nRoyal experts weighing in on the possibility of their meet-up also denied any chances of their reconciliation.

Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams also chimed in, claiming that Middleton's preventive chemotherapy treatment acts as an additional hindrance, but even then, their \"deep\" rift leaves no room

First, she and Prince Harry popped into Windsor just before Easter, and they had a breezy meeting with QEII. As they were leaving, they found that Charles and Camilla had rushed over to meet them. Then the Sussexes were off to The Hague for Invictus. Skip ahead to the Jubbly, and the Sussexes brought their kids over to meet QEII, they were given their own procession through the church and they left with the rest of the family. As they were going to and from St. Paul's Cathedral, there was some talk about people \"booing\" them or cheering them. The videos made it seem like a few people booed but most people cheered. Given that the British press regularly posts operatives in crowds to shout/boo at people, it would not surprise me if there was some booing.\n\nThen came QEII's funeral and the Sussexes being held hostage in England for nearly two full weeks. The intense focus on the Sussexes was astonishing and disgusting, especially given that the Windsors were openly sadistic towards Harry and Meghan in front of the international media. It would not surprise me if, during those traumatic days, Meghan privately pledged to never return there again. Because she hasn't. She refused to go to the coronation and she will not join Harry this week for the Invictus anniversary event in London. Instead of just acknowledging the fact that Meghan is never going to come back to a country, family or national media which abused her for years (and still abuses her from a distance), royal correspondent Chris Ship claims that Meghan isn't returning to the UK this week because...she doesn't want to be booed.\n\nMeghan Markle may not be accompanying Harry to the UK for the Invictus Games event because she is afraid that she will be booed by the British public again, a royal expert has said. Prince Harry, 39, is set to fly to the UK next week for the event but he will not be joined by his wife. Instead the Duchess of Sussex, 42, will fly from the US to Nigeria to meet her husband for an official visit immediately afterwards.\n\nThe mother-of-two is worried about coming back because she does not want to feel unwelcome by royalists at St Paul's for the second time, according to ITV News' royal correspondent Chris Ship. Meghan and Harry went to the historic landmark in 2022 to participate in celebrations for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee. But when they exited the car, they were greeted by some smiles, cheers and applause - but also booing.\n\nSpeaking on the Sun's Royal Exclusive Show, he said: 'We heard the boos for them. We should be clear there was also people cheering for them, but there were definitely boos at St Paul's Cathedral. So going back there I can see why Meghan may not wish to accompany Harry there.'\n\nIn September 2022, the Duchess of Sussex travelled to Windsor Castle with her husband Harry, Kate and William to greet those who wanted to pay their respects to Queen after she passed away. The former fab-four walked around and interacted with people who were eager to offer their best wishes to the royals during the tough time.

The king took some time away from public-facing duties several months ago, but even during his treatment, he remained active in his role.\n\nNow, a source close to the king revealed that he has written letters to friends, shedding a greater light on his diagnosis and how he feels about it.\n\nThe king's team announced back in January 2024 that he was going in for a prostate procedure. However, during the course of his doctors' visits and surgery, cancer was discovered. Buckingham Palace never revealed what type of cancer Charles was diagnosed with or its stage, but they immediately said there was much optimism about his recovery. Now, about three months later, Charles is ready to return to royal duties.\n\nAccording to Express, one friend of Charles told The Times, \"I hear determination that he doesn't want to let it slow him down, a pragmatic acceptance of the changes that have had to be made to his program, and an absolute desire to get back to full speed.\"\n\nOther friends of the king said that Charles' health is \"somewhat battered\" and that he has felt like a \"caged lion\" having to miss so many royal events for treatment. Of course, Charles chose to put his health first, but it doesn't surprise anyone that he is ready to get back to full speed. There are reports that he is even ready to travel and is planning to head to Normandy in early June. While absent, Prince William has taken on the bulk of royal duties while also balancing plenty of time at home with his family as his wife, Kate Middleton, receives chemotherapy treatment. Kate revealed her cancer diagnosis in March.\n\nCharles and his son, Prince Harry, have not always been on the best terms, but they will reportedly reunite on May 8 as Harry visits the United Kingdom to attend a ceremony in honor of the Invictus Games at St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nHarry's wife, Meghan Markle, will not make the trip with him, but it at least does give Charles and Harry some time to sit down together one on one. It's unclear at this point if Harry plans to see William, though the rumors suggest the two men will not meet up.\n\nCharles is focused on returning to royal duties, but Harry mentioned during a February interview that the cancer diagnosis could bring the family back together, so it's likely not lost on either of them that things with Charles' health could have ended very differently.

ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral today (8 May).\n\nThis event will be attended by none of the fifth in line to the throne's immediate family, it has been confirmed.\n\nA spokesperson for Harry revealed that the King will not be able to see him on his current trip due to his busy schedule.\n\nThey said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThe revelation comes after the King returned to work last week following the news that he has now made sufficient progress in his cancer treatment.\n\nHe will, however, be undertaking a reduced summer programme to avoid over-exerting himself as he is still undergoing treatment for an undisclosed form of the disease.\n\nHarry and the King last saw each other for a reported 45 minutes in February when Harry rushed to the UK after learning of his father's cancer diagnosis.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

with him", "body": "KING Charles ruled out a face-to-face meeting with Harry -- saying he was too busy.\n\nHours later, in a second snub, the King revealed eldest son William will take charge of Harry's former helicopter regiment next week.\n\nHarry, 39, was keen to see his dad after jetting from California but his spokesman said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\"\n\nHarry flew in for events marking ten years of his Invictus Games, while the King greeted Fiji's Prime Minister at Buckingham Palace.\n\nTwo hours later, the King revealed that next Monday he will be at a ceremony to confirm William, 41, as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps -- Harry's former regiment.\n\nThe event will take place in front of an Apache -- the type of helicopter Harry flew when serving in Afghanistan.\n\nWilliam, who flew with the Air Ambulance, will also take to the skies in the chopper.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"Timing is everything.\"\n\nSources claim Harry made multiple attempts to arrange a meeting with his dad before flying 5,000 miles for three days in the UK.\n\nAt 9.30am, Charles, 75, was photographed leaving Windsor Castle in the State Bentley and seen reading government papers in the back seat.\n\nAround the same time, Harry touched down without Meghan or their two children.\n\nHe was driven to the Honourable Artillery Company HQ in Shoreditch, East London for an Invictus Games discussion.\n\nHe was pictured smiling as he left there just after 6pm.\n\nEarlier in the day the King spoke to Fiji's Sitiveni Rabuka at the Palace.\n\nAt 2pm, the Office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced Harry would not meet his father.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment or respond.\n\nSoon after, the Palace announced the date for William to take charge of the Army Air Corps, to which Harry was attached for his second tour of Afghanistan until 2014.\n\nWilliam's role had been announced in August.\n\nYesterday it was confirmed the ceremony will take place next Monday at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, Hants.\n\nThe King will walk to the control tower and officially pass the role of Colonel-in-Chief, which he held for 31 years, to William.\n\nThe Prince of Wales will then receive a briefing on the Corps' work from the Colonel Commandant, Lt-Gen Sir Nicholas Borton.\n\nWilliam will view a training drill and take controls of the Apache for a flight.\n\nToday, Charles and Harry will be two miles apart as the Duke attends an Invictus Games celebration at St Paul's Cathedral from 5pm.\n\nThe pair's diaries also fail to align tomorrow when Harry has \"private meetings\" and the King is understood to have an engagement in Windsor.\n\nAt the end of the week Harry, who is said to be staying in a hotel, will be joined by wife Meghan for a trip to Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, William will be in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nHarry passed his Army Air Corps grading and Pilot's Selection Board interview in December 2008 to begin pilot training in January 2009.\n\nOn his first tour of Afghanistan in 2008 he called in air strikes on Taliban positions.\n\nHe later qualified as an Apache commander in 2012 after three years of training.\n\nThen he spent a five-month tour in Afghanistan where he piloted an Apache.\n\nHarry wrote glowingly about the 'copter in his memoir Spare, saying: \"What a privilege, I thought, to experience this kind of raw power, and to put it to work for our side.\"\n\nBut he sparked outrage when he revealed he had killed 25 enemy fighters, writing: \"I didn't think of those 25 as people.\n\n\"They were chess pieces removed from the board.\n\n\"Bad people eliminated before they could kill good people.\"\n\nIn January, Harry was honoured in Los Angeles in the 21st Annual Living Legends of Aviation Awards alongside John Travolta.\n\nWilliam served in the Army as a Platoon Commander in The Blues and Royals, before completing flying training in the Royal Air Force.\n\nHe spent three years as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot in Anglesey, North Wales, before working as an Air Ambulance pilot in East Anglia for two years.\n\nHe has remained in the cockpit to keep his piloting hours up to retain his licence.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was a challenging year, marked by ongoing difficulties with his estranged son Prince Harry and a cancer diagnosis.\n\nTo commemorate the occasion, gun salutes were scheduled to be fired in central London and other spots throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nThough no formal celebrations were scheduled, the milestone was reached less than a week after King Charles returned to public life following his diagnosis.\n\nOn Tuesday, he went to see other cancer patients at a hospital in London, where the physicians expressed their encouragement at his improvement.\n\nThe 75-year-old monarch, who has not disclosed the type of cancer he has, was also reportedly keen to mark the day with minimal \"fuss\" given the link between his accession and the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby who crowned King Charles a year ago at Westminster Abbey praised his \"sense of duty\".\n\n\"The past year has presented the king with some great personal challenges. But I have been struck by his continued sense of duty, having recently returned to royal engagements following treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"His openness in sharing his condition has been characteristic of his willingness to help and support others,\" he added.\n\nThe anniversary comes as an Ipsos poll for the Daily Mail saw King Charles's personal popularity rating rise slightly to 56 percent.\n\nHis son and heir Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Princess of Wales, were the most popular members of the royal family on 69 percent each, up 8-10 percent since last April.\n\nCatherine, 42, also known as Kate, announced her own shock cancer diagnosis in late March following abdominal surgery which had already forced her to withdraw from public life.\n\nThe double blow of both King Charles and Catherine's ill health has left the royal family with a shortage of frontline royals with William also stepping back for a while to help care for his wife and family.\n\nQueen Camilla, 76, stepped in to take over many of her husband's engagements while King Charles's sister Princess Anne and his youngest brother Prince Edward have also taken on more prominent roles.\n\nBut King Charles and Catherine's absence was felt even more keenly as the king's younger son Harry is no longer a working royal.\n\nHarry dramatically relocated to North America in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle.\n\nHarry will return to the UK this week to attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games for disabled military veterans.\n\nThe domestic PA agency reported that he was \"likely to be reunited with (King) Charles\" at some point during his visit.\n\nA demonstration organised by the anti-monarchy group Republic on Sunday, meanwhile, attracted around 100 people in Trafalgar Square.\n\nProtesters shouted \"abdicate, abdicate\" and two large banners reading \"abolish the monarchy\" and \"change (the) country for good\" were hung in front of an art gallery.\n\nLast year's coronation saw tens of thousands of people line the streets of London and street parties held up and down the country.\n\nTelevision images of the historic

This development comes amidst ongoing tension within the Royal Family, further evidenced by scheduling conflicts preventing a meeting between Charles and Harry this week.\n\nHarry is back in the UK attending commitments related to the Invictus Games and a celebratory event at St Paul's Cathedral marking the project's 10th anniversary.\n\nSources previously suggested that Charles was keen on seeing his younger son during his UK visit, however, such a meeting now appears unlikely due to his busy schedule, reports the Mirror.\n\nReflecting on this, a spokesperson said: \"It, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\"\n\nNonetheless, there seems to be a glimmer of hope with Harry indicated by the statement, which adds he \"hopes to see him [Charles] soon,\" suggesting the option for reconciliation remains open.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nThe last visit between the two was shortly after the public announcement of Charles' cancer diagnosis, when Harry quickly returned to the UK to see his father. However, their meeting was brief, lasting just 30 minutes before Charles returned to Sandringham to rest following the commencement of his outpatient treatment for cancer.\n\nCharles has recently been given the green light by his medical team to return to some of his public duties, after a period restricted to handling business of state behind closed doors - which according to his nephew Peter Phillips left the monarch feeling somewhat \"frustrated\".\n\nAlthough Charles' schedule will still be determined based on medical advice and he isn't anticipated to fully resume his former workload over the summer, his doctors are \"sufficiently pleased\" with his recovery progress to allow him to take up official duties again.\n\nMost recent of his official engagements included a trip to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre and the Royal Windsor Horse Show an event much loved by the late Queen Elizabeth.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

But the problem is that any meeting with Harry would have completely overshadowed Charles' ongoing return to work this week, which is what his office, quite rightly, would see as the story of the week. Charles is hosting a garden party for 5,000 people on Wednesday. That's a pretty miraculous and brave thing for a man being treated for cancer to do. Does he really want that pushed off the front pages?\n\n\"His office don't want to think about the Duke of Sussex. I think if the country was clamoring for Charles to meet Harry, he absolutely would have met him, but Harry is still very unpopular in the U.K.\n\n\"Plenty of people still think Harry ruined the final years of his grandparents (Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip) with his attacks on her life's work. Does Charles want to spend his political capital rehabilitating Harry, especially if Harry then uses that to enhance his commercial deals?

But I have been struck by his continued sense of duty, having recently returned to royal engagements following treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"His openness in sharing his condition has been characteristic of his willingness to help and support others,\" he added.\n\nThe anniversary comes as an Ipsos poll for the Daily Mail saw King Charles's personal popularity rating rise slightly to 56 per cent.\n\nHis son and heir Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Princess of Wales, were the most popular members of the royal family with 69 per cent each, up 8-10 per cent since last April.\n\nCatherine, 42, also known as Kate, announced her own shock cancer diagnosis in late March following abdominal surgery which had already forced her to withdraw from public life.\n\nThe double blow of both Charles's and Catherine's ill health has left the royal family facing a shortage of frontline royals, with William also stepping back for a while to help care for his wife and family.\n\nQueen Camilla, 76, stepped in to take over many of her husband's engagements while King Charles's sister Princess Anne and his youngest brother Prince Edward have also taken on more prominent roles.\n\nBut King Charles and Catherine's absence was felt even more keenly as the king's younger son Harry is no longer a working royal.\n\nHarry dramatically relocated to North America in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle.\n\nHarry will return to the UK this week to attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games for disabled military veterans.\n\nThe domestic PA agency reported that he was \"likely to be reunited with (King) Charles\" at some point during his visit.\n\nA demonstration organised by the anti-monarchy group Republic on Sunday, meanwhile, attracted around 100 people in Trafalgar Square.\n\nProtesters shouted \"abdicate, abdicate\" and two large banners reading \"abolish the monarchy\" and \"change (the) country for good\" were hung in front of an art gallery.\n\nLast year's coronation saw tens of thousands of people line the streets of London and street parties held up and down the country.\n\nTelevision images of the historic ceremony at Westminster Abbey were beamed around the world.", "source": {"uri": "channelstv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Channels Television"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Prince Harry's team just confirmed that his father King Charles III isn't making time to see him during his rare visit to the United Kingdom! Ouch!\n\nThe Duke of Sussex arrived in London on Tuesday ahead of the tenth anniversary celebrations for the Invictus Games on Wednesday (without Meghan Markle, who chose to stay home in Cali). There's been lots of talk about whether or not the estranged father and son would meet up during his travels, with previous sources hinting that the monarch would likely be snubbing the Spare author. And now we know that's indeed true!\n\nRelated: Catherine Receives Historic New Royal Title From Charles Amid Cancer Battle\n\nA spokesperson for the Archewell founder actually addressed the speculation in a statement to Page Six on Tuesday, sharing:\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\"\n\nSeriously?! He doesn't have ANY time? That's crazy! Their super brief visit back in February, after Charles' cancer diagnosis, must've been very s**tty if the 75-year-old isn't making even the tiniest effort to connect with his son this time! But staying cordial, the rep simply continued:\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nSeveral insiders had claimed Harry invited his family members to the milestone event as an olive branch -- and yet Charles, Prince Willian, Princess Catherine, and no other senior members of the royal family are expected to attend. Whoa. They're all shutting him out. We suppose this is no surprise considering tensions are still high, but with Charles and Catherine both facing cancer treatment, we would've hoped to see some reconciliation! Especially since it sounds like Harry has been pushing for one!\n\nOther sources told the outlet that the 39-year-old has been trying to organize a meet-up for OVER A MONTH! So, Charles' busy schedule was totally on purpose! Jeez! Hugo Vickers, a royal historian and friend of the royal family, also noted that His Majesty could \"easily\" find time for his youngest if he wanted to do so!! Vickers said:\n\n\"If the king wanted to see Harry, he would find time very easily. You can never be too busy to see your son. It's a good idea if they do meet to forge some kind of reconciliation.\"\n\nCharles wouldn't even necessarily need to rearrange his plans, either. He could simply have breakfast with Harry, Vickers pointed out, before heading off to his weekly audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and attending the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season. Discussing talks of a future reconciliation, a royal source shared:\n\n\"The king has left the door wide open but obviously not that wide. But they absolutely can stuff things in his diary and juggle things around.\"\n\nAnd yet he's not! So, that proves that Charles is not willing to reconcile. Brutal considering his health conditions! As for why he might be going the extra mile to avoid Harry, a senior royal insider suggested February's visit was a big problem:\n\n\"We don't know how that meeting went, but I do know that the king was exhausted from chemotherapy and really keen to get off to Balmoral. He was desperate to be on his way and was delayed until Harry turned up.\"\n\nWe get that there is a TON of bad blood between these two, but to be that annoyed when your son wanted to see you after news of a scary, life-threatening illness is wild! Just saying!\n\nAs for why the Prince of Wales rejected the invite, a confidant explained:\n\n\"William is a hop, skip and a jump from the throne, with an ill wife and three young children -- he has plenty on his plate.\"\n\nIt's a lot easier to understand William's refusal to connect than Charles, TBH! Obviously, Harry brought a lot of this feud on himself and all that. But it is still rough to see his relatives hold such a grudge when he's trying to fix things!\n\nThoughts? Do you think it's super shady of Charles to snub Harry or is it totally fine considering their messy history?

The reason given was \"due to his majesty's full program.\"\n\nHours after this was reported, Buckingham Palace announced that on May 13, Charles will attend a joint engagement with William to officially hand over to him the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps, Harry's old army regiment.\n\nThese developments, Newsweek's chief royal correspondent Jack Royston told Sky News anchor Wilfred Frost on Wednesday, could prove detrimental to the monarchy as Harry's veteran status is still hugely respected in Britain.\n\n\"I think it's very disappointing,\" he said of the news Charles and his younger son won't meet during this visit.\n\n\"I also think the monarchy is at risk here of looking a little bit petty. Part of the reason for that is that on the very day that we discovered that Harry and Charles weren't going to meet, they also put out a news release advertising an event next week in which Charles is going to give William an accolade that 100% would have gone to Harry if Harry was still a working member of the royal family.\"\n\n\"Harry served in the Army Air Corps in Afghanistan,\" Royston continued. \"He was co-pilot gunner of an Apache helicopter. And he fought the Taliban on the front line, putting his life at risk. Now, Charles for decades has been our honorary Colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps, he's now going to give that to Prince William.\n\n\"They announced the actual ceremony is going to be in front of an Apache -- the very type of helicopter that Harry flew -- William's going to be learning about the functioning of this helicopter that Harry knows how to fly. It's terrible framing, I think, and it looks very petty.\"\n\nWilliam is a qualified helicopter pilot. He served as a search-and-rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force for three years and in 2015 became an air ambulance helicopter pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance (EAAA).\n\nThe prince left the EAAA in 2017 to take on full-time royal duties. In August 2023, it was announced that as part of his accession reorganization of patronages, Charles had appointed William as the new Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe palace's move regarding Harry comes as recent polling showed that Charles, Harry and William's popularity in Britain has received a boost since May 2023, a position that the monarchy no doubt would benefit from prolonging.\n\n\"It's about how the public read the myth of the motivation behind [Charles] not seeing Harry,\" Royston said of how this move will play with the public.\n\n\"When it was simply the case that Charles wasn't going to see him, that was hugely disappointing. The risk is that they look like it's deliberate and that it's petty, so they need to realize that if the public perceive this as a petty swipe at Harry, then that could actually wind up playing very badly for the monarchy, because this is a subject on which Harry still commands huge respect as a veteran of Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"It's hugely disappointing that Charles isn't going to see Harry,\" he said. \"I get asked so often, 'Will they ever simply repair the relationship?' And I think that's what most members of the public actually want more than anything else. They want royal relations to be warm again.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_crawford_smith@newsweek.com", "name": "James

Was there not even time for a cup of tea or dinner?\n\nWe may never know - and all sides would probably rather we stopped trying to guess.\n\nWhatever is going on, it just feels terribly sad that you have a family that still seems so divided despite them dealing with the double cancer diagnosis for both the King and the Princess of Wales.\n\nThere hasn't even been any mention that Harry might see his brother William.\n\nWhatever was going on with his blood relatives, Prince Harry's military family was always going to be his focus this week.\n\nHis trip revolves around events to mark the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Invictus Games.\n\nChief executive Dominic Reid was there from the start and told me it's always been more than a patronage for Harry, it's a genuine passion, and he doesn't believe the split in the family has had any kind of negative impact.\n\n\"There's the business of him being in a different place,\" Mr Reid said. \"So I see him face-to-face less regularly. We all do. But he does join all of our meetings and he does come to all our events.\n\n\"So no, I mean, and it was always his patronage. It's not a royal patronage. It's not in the gift of the royal family. It's his thing. And we're delighted to have him as our patron.\"\n\nAhead of the games in Florida in 2016, Prince Harry told me he thought Invictus would have a shelf life.\n\nBut despite everything else going on in his personal life, it continues to be a huge part of his charity work and the whole concept is still very much needed.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nThieves steal museum's 'most prized object'\n\nPubs may stay open longer during Euro 2024\n\nMr Reid said: \"It's a source of great sadness that we are now living in a world where the requirement is colossal. You know, we didn't think there would be war in Europe.\n\n\"We didn't think there would be people being injured on a daily basis the way they are. And clearly that requirement is still there... It's phenomenal to just feel the degree to which Invictus has become a convening platform for veteran care.\"\n\nFor all the negative headlines, you can't deny the impact Harry's Games have had over the past 10 years.\n\nAt Wednesday's conference, he talked about how wives, husbands and children have thanked him for giving their loved ones a purpose.\n\nIt's clear those athletes have needed Harry - now it feels like he needs them more than ever; his military family among whom he still feels at home.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/04/1600x900/skynews-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex_6526658.jpg?20240419150923", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Personal things have been said about the Prince of Wales about William's supposed attack on Harry which made the last headline in Spare.\"\n\nEven if Meghan did offer an olive branch to the Palace, it does not mean she is likely to give up her new life in California, he said.\n\nThe former Hollywood actress and Harry are focused on their various media projects - including their non-profit organisation Archewell.\n\nMr Fitzwilliams added: \"There's absolutely no question that the rest would never have got to this stage if they stopped or hadn't started to attack the royal family since they believe they got such a raw deal when they were members of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "salma_ouaguira@the-sun.com", "name": "Salma Ouaguira", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fitzwilliams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Fitzwilliams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omid_Scobie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omid Scobie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archewell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/05/newspress-collage-pyv8wf3u2-1715027542188.jpg?1715013234&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Queen Camilla has banned all private conversations between the father and the son, the insider revealed.\n\nRoyal commentator Angela Levin has made explosive claims while speaking to GB News. King Charles is not allowed to be alone with his younger son as Queen Camilla is against such interactions as Harry \"can't be trusted\", she said.\n\nAccording to the insider, there is a worry that King Charles might inadvertently disclose sensitive information about his health during a one-on-one conversation with his son.\n\n\"I think King Charles is vulnerable. He might say something about his health,\" Levin said.\n\n\"Nobody really wants to see him (Harry). King Charles will, because he's his father, and fathers love their children even if they go off and behave badly,\" she added.\n\nThe relationship between the Duke of Sussexx and the British Royal Family has been strained due to numerous controversial revelations by Harry, according to Levin. She suggests that these incidents have led to a loss of trust, impacting how family interactions are managed.\n\nHarry is going to attend a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London on May 8 to celebrate the Invictus Games, Reuters earlier reported. He founded the international sporting event for military personnel wounded in action. The Duke himself served as a military helicopter pilot in Afghanistan.\n\nOn the same day, King Charles is expected to attend a garden party. Buckingham Palace, however, announced earlier that his attendance would be confirmed \"on the day\".\n\n\"This time it's going to be particularly awkward because the service at St Paul's Cathedral is going to finish at 6 PM, which is exactly the time that the first garden party of the year, which King Charles is going to, also finishes at 6 PM,\" Levin said.\n\nThis scheduling makes a private meeting between Charles and Harry challenging, not only due to the lack of time but also because of the physical demands these events place on the King, she added.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sounak_mukhopadhyay@livemint.com", "name": "Sounak Mukhopadhyay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/05/07/600x338/Britain-Coronation-One-Year-1_1715064666390_1715064698537.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1223, "textEnd": 1228}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

When asked by the reporter at the time whether there was any truth to the reports, the Duke said \"inevitably stuff happens\" but that there was little truth to the speculation, saying: \"The majority of the stuff is created out of nothing but as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\"\n\nHarry added of William: \"We are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.

Now, in what comes as a relief to the Royal family, King Charles' doctors have reassessed their previous advice, telling him he can conduct some public interactions as they are \"sufficiently pleased with the progress made so far\" by the King.\n\nAlthough he won't be returning to full duties and any upcoming events will \"remain subject to doctors' advice\" states a palace spokesperson, his calendar for the next week is already brimming. However, despite his packed timetable, a Royal insider has asserted that King Charles fully plans to make time for Harry.\n\nThe monarch's personal schedule is being handled on an individual basis, with his health being central to his activities, but he and Harry have remained in touch since their reunion in February, and things have \"remained positive\" between them, claims a source.", "source": {"uri": "edinburghlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "edinburghlive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_mackenzie@edinburghlive.co.uk", "name": "Emma Mackenzie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hogg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Hogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandringham_House", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandringham House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal family"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i2-prod.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article29124632.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_topshot-britain-royals-king.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

And I know that he would have been so pleased to get back to public duties. He would have missed it tremendously,\" the speaker of the House of Commons said, sharing details from her weekly meetings with Charles in her role as Privy Council Lord President.\n\n\"I think everyone is really pleased to see him back and I know that he wants to do more, so it's been a good week,\" Mourdant added. \"I think people won't be surprised to know that he's completely charming and always calm. And he's also got a really good sense of humor as well.\n\n\"But he's always asking about how things are going, particularly issues that we're dealing with in Parliament or about particular groups who he knows that are having a rough time,\" she said. \"He's always asking after those people, so he cares a great deal and he's a delight to work with.\"\n\nAs his daughter-in-law Catherine was admitted for abdominal surgery in January, Charles announced that he would be having a procedure on an enlarged prostate, which resulted in a three-month break from public-facing duties so he could focus on his treatment and recuperation. In February, he was diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer.\n\nBuckingham Palace announced in late April that the king would return to work amid treatment. The monarch, who just marked the one-year anniversary of his coronation, visited a cancer charity with Queen Camilla on April 30, his first day back to work, and confirmed that he had treatment scheduled for later that day.\n\nOn Friday, he attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show despite rain and is scheduled to attend a garden party at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday. He's also due to host a state visit by the emperor and empress of Japan in June.\n\nThe king's busy schedule is being cited as the reason he and Prince Harry, fourth in line to the British throne, won't connect during his youngest son's visit to London this week -- one that comes after the fallout from Harry's stepping back from royal duties in 2020 and the bombshell 2023 memoir \"Spare.\" The duke of Sussex, who primarily lives in California with his wife Meghan and two children, is back in the U.K. this week to celebrate a decade of the Invictus Games, a tournament for wounded veterans that Harry founded in 2014.\n\nIn response to speculation on whether the prince will see his father during the visit, a spokesman for Harry cited the king's \"full programme.\" Harry was last in the U.K. in February to visit his father shortly after the king was diagnosed with cancer. The prince told \"Good Morning America\" at the time that he \"jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could,\" adding that he loves his family.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" Prince Harry's spokesman told the BBC on Tuesday.\n\nHis brother William, Prince of Wales, also won't attend the service for the Invictus Games, which will be held Wednesday at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

A very different tone to just months earlier, when Harry had insisted that he'd need his family to take \"accountability\" before he'd consider even making up with them.\n\nThat ultimatum, by all accounts, was completely ignored - and yet the Duke of Sussex continues to make it clear he's had a fairly dramatic change of heart.\n\nAn argument could certainly be made about lying in the beds we've made and reaping what you sow, yada yada, but it's hard not to feel sympathy for him this week as it becomes abundantly clear just how far his expectations are from reality.\n\nThere's no doubt Charles declining his request for a catch-up while they're literally two miles away from each other would have come as both a heavy blow and major disappointment.\n\nRecall, just three months ago - and fresh from his visit to see his dad in the UK - Harry's interview with US breakfast show Good Morning America about his optimistic plans for their future face time.\n\n\"I love my family. The fact I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend anytime with him? I'm grateful to that ... I have got other trips planned that would take me through the UK or back to the UK, so I will stop in and see my family as much as a I can,\" he told the reporter.\n\nClearly, among the \"other trips\" on his mind at the time included the highly-publicised Invictus Games' 10 year anniversary service, of which he's currently back in his home country to take part.\n\nHowever, that's not to be - as (rather diplomatically) confirmed by Harry himself just hours ahead of the big event.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nPerhaps Harry had seen the writing on the wall ahead of his failed attempt to meet up with Charles if he happened to check the news just a few days ago.\n\nSources told The Mirror that Harry had been in contact with his father ahead of his arrival in the UK, to which the King told him he would certainly do so ... but only \"if he is able\".\n\nThose four words, really, should have served as a major warning about what was to come.\n\nThe royal family may be a business, yet they're also still a family.\n\nIt's hard to conceive of another scenario where a once-close father and son, grappling with a shock cancer diagnosis and having lived on different continents for four years, would not see each other when once again sharing a city. Even if just for the half-hour afforded to Harry when he last flew back.\n\nFrom the duke's own memoir, along with many reports over the years, it's obvious that the monarch may be the head of an institution - but he is bound by carefully laid-out schedules often dictated by the system around him.\n\nThere's no doubt Charles is busy, and regularly is at the mercy of his pre-planned diary.\n\nBut Harry's attendance at the Invictus Games' event, and his desire to reconcile with his father, have been on the horizon for some time. Neither of them have come as a surprise.\n\nFor all the multiple reports affirming Charles' unconditional \"love\" of his son, and eagerness to put the past behind them, it seems he might still be a trifle put out by the many barbs fired his and his wife's way in recent times, after all.\n\nBack in February, the optimistic prince had told GMA that health struggles, such as his father's, often sees \"the strength of the family unit coming together\".\n\nIn this case, it's clear that's not quite eventuating how he might have hoped - and you really can't help feeling a little sorry for him.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bronte_coy@news.com.au", "name": "Bronte Coy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3a06362c1dfecb98b11ab23a3a7e3c5d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Prince Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor turned five on 6 May, with a professional balloon company based in California sharing a custom-made balloon display with the Prince's name.\n\nVentura County Balloons took to their Instagram stories to share the adorable sculpture with the caption: \"Balloon bouquets all day, every day! DM to book and surprise loved ones!\" The picture showed a huge silver inflatable number five surrounded by an array of different-shaped multicoloured balloons.\n\nThe lavish celebratory design also featured a sweet message which read: \"Happy birthday Archie\". A separate star-shaped gold balloon contained only the young royal's name, while a second white one was decorated with the words 'Happy Birthday'.\n\nThere was also a feature transparent balloon in the display which contained smaller brightly coloured balloons within it. Meghan and Harry don't appear in the snap which appears to have been taken in a quiet residential area, but the Daily Mail reports that the bouquet was likely designed for the young prince.\n\nVentura County Balloons, who say they are experts in 'creating unforgettable experiences', also provide bespoke balloon arrangements for weddings, baby showers, and corporate events.\n\nIt comes following the news that Prince Harry will not be visiting his father King Charles during his trip to the UK. The Duke of Sussex arrived in England on Tuesday, 7 May, following a solo journey from California, with wife Meghan Markle remaining in California.\n\nHis spokesperson put it down to a clash in diaries, and the busy schedule King Charles has to attend to, since he returned to Royal duties after being diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.\n\n\"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" said the statement from Harry's team.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry is scheduled to attend an event on 8 May at St Paul's Cathedral to mark 10 years of the Invictus Games.

It is heartening to see His Majesty so active again.\n\nThe King and Prince Harry once shared a special bond, but now each meeting between them seems fraught with the weight of previous disappointments\n\nThe relationship between The King and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is overshadowed with tension and misunderstanding\n\nYet, amid all this activity, it looks as though there will be no time to meet his younger son, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.\n\nHarry is due to be in London ahead of Thursday's service at St Paul's Cathedral in honour of the Invictus Games, his project for wounded, injured and sick former service personnel.\n\nBut I'm told that father and son will not see each other on this occasion - that there have been no requests for a meeting.\n\nBoth men are understandably busy.\n\nThe prince, who no longer has a house in the UK, will make his own arrangements for accommodation. He won't be staying at any of the Royal Residences and has made no request to do so.\n\nWhich means that yet another opportunity for reconciliation has seemingly slipped away.

Meanwhile, his father almost immediately headed off to Sandringham in Norfolk for some rest and recuperation.\n\nSad though this might seem, the brevity was all too understandable given the patterns of previous behaviour.\n\nYet nothing changes this key fact: His Majesty's love for his youngest son is enduring.\n\nDespite chasms of miscommunication and the repercussions of a very public fallout, the family bond - at its core - remains unbroken.\n\nThe tragedy of the situation lies not in malice but in a series of unfortunate misunderstandings and external pressures that have calcified into an almost insurmountable barrier.\n\nIt is also true that, with his well-documented impulsivity and naivety, Harry might not always grasp the full implications of his actions.\n\nHis desire for transparency and change, while noble, can sometimes collide with the traditional expectations and obligations of royal life.\n\nHis actions suggest a man desperately seeking a foothold - yet failing.\n\nHarry's naivety can be dangerous, and not just for him but for all parties involved as it fuels the fires of speculation.\n\nThat's why, if King Charles does choose to forego a meeting at this sensitive time, the decision will not be a fresh act of rejection or dismissal but rooted in a painful history.\n\nAnd we should have the compassion to see it as such.\n\nWhy shouldn't the King take a sensible protective measure that would guard both against further emotional strain and the rigorous demands of managing his health?\n\nUltimately, the hope for reconciliation remains alive, albeit tempered by realism.\n\nThe path to healing is labyrinthine and fraught with potential setbacks. But it is not yet closed.\n\nWe should hope for understanding and peace between a father and his son, against the backdrop of their very public roles and private pains.\n\nWhether they meet or not in the next few days - and if they do, it is likely to be last-minute and fleeting - their dilemma is a poignant reminder of the human emotions at work behind the grand facade of royalty.\n\nRobert Jobson is the author of the Sunday Times bestseller Our King: Charles III - The Man and Monarch", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Majesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Garden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Garden"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Dorries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nadine Dorries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandringham_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandringham House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/07/12/84552629-0-image-m-2_1715080400993.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

However, no royal members are expected to attend the important celebration. Is this because King Charles is being petty? A royal commentator explains.\n\nPrince Harry will be in London on May 8 to attend a service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral. This service will mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style competition for wounded service members that he founded in 2014.\n\nHowever, it has been reported that Charles will not meet with his youngest son during his visit. Additionally, no other royal family members are also scheduled to attend the event.\n\nNews.com.au commentator Daniela Elser states that this move is petty, calling it \"bad form your majesty.\" She adds, \"In snubbing this week's Invictus service, it looks like the King cannot see past his complicated relationship with this son and the amazing thing his son has 'created' for the global military community.\"\n\nElser continued, \"It's not even as if Charles himself would have to front up to St. Paul's and have to pretend to make nice with Harry. The king could just as easily have sent along Prince Edward, Princess Anne, or the 88-year-old, still working, Duke of Kent, who spent 21 years in the military, ending as a field marshal, the highest army rank possible.\"\n\nShe concludes, \"But nope. As things stand on Monday, no members of Team Crown will be flying the flag for the king at St Paul's.\"\n\nOn April 26, the royal family's Instagram page announced King Charles would be returning to public-facing duties. The king drastically cut back on public appearances after a cancer diagnosis in February 2024.\n\nThe Associated Press claims that Charles' health struggles helped him connect with people on a deeper level. They write, \"People have begun to see him as a more flesh-and-blood character who faces the same challenges as them, not just an archetype of wealth and privilege.\"\n\nHowever, Daniela Elser calls this type of assessment regarding Charles' current situation with his son, \"weapons-grade hypocrisy. Buckingham Palace sources have spent much of the last few days telling the UK papers how real and open the king now is, three months after being diagnosed with cancer, you would think they would see the hypocrisy here.\"\n\n\"And yet it's this same 'warm' king who looks set to give the military community the cold shoulder. Seemingly because their greatest champion happens to be his troublesome younger son,\" she continues.\n\nIronically, at the same time Prince Harry will be at St. Paul's Cathedral, King Charles will be attending his first garden party of the season. Daniela Elser finds it \"interesting\" that Charles' party is scheduled for the same day as Harry's anniversary celebration.\n\nElser writes, \"Interesting that the King chose this day to make his big splashy return to public duty. At nearly the same moment, Harry will be fully showered with praise [at the Invictus celebration].\"\n\nShe continues, \"Don't anyone get their hopes up about some touchy-feely meeting. So, in summary, what have we learned today? King Charles is fallible and human. And that even someone with their very own throne can, at times, struggle to behave like an adult.\"\n\nKing Charles continues to recover from cancer. Prince Harry is expected to stay in the United Kingdom for a few days after the service.

Harry's automatic taxpayer-funded security was removed officially when he and Meghan were in Canada and across the world borders were closing in an attempt to control the Covid pandemic.\n\nIn both his memoir and the couple's Netflix documentary, the couple recall the fear they felt when they realised they were about to lose their security protection - despite, they say, the threat against them being unchanging.\n\nSince then, Harry has been embroiled in an ongoing saga with the Home Office over his security in the UK, offering to pay for it himself - something that was denied. When the Duke visits these days, his security is managed on a \"bespoke\" case-by-case basis, rather than being automatically supplied. This means that sometimes Harry pays for security himself, and on other occasions the government deem it appropriate to pay for it and supply him with police protection.\n\nHarry has returned to the UK to celebrate 10 years of the Invictus Games, which will be marked in a special service at St. Paul's Cathedral. The last time he visited the UK was to see his father King Charles after he had been diagnosed with cancer and begun regular treatment. On this occasion, Harry was given a police escort from Heathrow Airport to central London, where he spent under an hour with his father - before Charles left for Sandringham to rest.\n\nWith the Duke of Sussex's security arrangments now being \"bespoke\" rather than automatically supplied, it's currently up to the Home Office to decide whether or not he will be given police protection when he returns. This has been a point of contention for Harry, who doesn't feel able to bring his family with him unless police security is assured.\n\nIn 2020, Harry and Meghan were offered a helping hand by Hollywood mogul Tyler Perry - their daughter Princess Lilibet's godfather - who offered them up his Beverly Hills mansion and the use of a security detail. The following year, when the couple took part in their bombshell interview with Oprah, Harry admitted that signing multimillion-pound deals with streaming services Netflix and Spotify had allowed the Sussexes to pay for their own private security team in the US.\n\nIn his memoir, Harry described his anxiety over the possibility of losing security in great detail - and the moment when it finally happened. \"I was desperate to keep security,\" he wrote. \"That was what worried me most, my family's physical safety. I wanted to prevent a repeat of history, another untimely death\". He also noted that the cost of a private security firm given to him by a company the palace recommended was estimated to be to the tune of a whopping \u00a36 million annually.\n\nA few months after their interview with Oprah, Harry returned to the UK where his legal team claimed his security was \"compromised due to the absence of police protection\". He launched a bid to pay for police security himself, with his legal team saying, \"The duke first offered to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January of 2020 at Sandringham. That offer was dismissed. He remains willing to cover the cost of security, as not to impose on the British taxpayer.\"\n\nIn May 2023, this bid was denied, with lawyers for the Home Office saying in written submissions it was \"not appropriate to support an outcome whereby wealthy individuals could 'buy' Protective Security from specialist police officers (potentially including armed officers),\" when the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (RAVEC) had decided it not to be in the public interest.\n\nIn February 2024, his challenge against the removal of automatic security was denied in the High Court, as was the right to appeal. However, Harry's not showing any indication that he is willing to give up on this fight just yet, with his legal team saying, \"The Duke of Sussex will be seeking permission from the Court of Appeal to challenge the decision of Mr Justice Lane.\"\n\nThe judge who made the ruling against Harry called RAVEC's decision \"legally sound\" and ordered that Harry should pay 90 percent of the Home Office's legal costs. However, Harry's legal team has maintained that just because he stepped back as a working royal, the reality of the threat level against him and his family has not altered, and they have previously noted that former politicians continue to receive protection from the police, although they have left public office.\n\nIn 2022, former head of counter-terrorism for the Metropolitan Police, Neil Basu, said to Channel 4 News that there had been \"disgusting and very real\" threats against Meghan by the far-right, and \"absolutely\" been genuine threats against her life. Basu noted, \"If you'd seen the stuff that was written and you were receiving it, the kind of rhetoric that's online, if you don't know what I know, you would feel under threat all of the time.\"\n\nHannah Furness, royal editor for The Telegraph, told Hello Magazine's Right Royal Podcast that this means Meghan might not come to the UK with her two children. \"There is quite a heavy narrative that Meghan and the children won't be coming back until they can resolve this security issue to their liking. But [Harry] will certainly be coming and going,\" the expert explained.\n\nThe royal expert added in her view, RAVEC was not likely to reverse their decision: \"Realistically I don't think it's going to change,\" Furness said, adding that despite this, \"anything [close to] remotely being an official engagement\" she believed Harry would be offered police protection.\n\nDo you have a story to tell?

They could leave their husbands at home. It's the two of them I want.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Sun today, royal expert Richard said: \"Indeed, if such a pairing could be imagined, you can imagine that the world would be absolutely fascinated by it.\n\n\"But it seems to me most unlikely that that will ever materialise now.\"\n\nThe expert said he believed the Sussexes would have never showed face as \"A-Listers would not have been impressed\".\n\nRichard continued: \"You get the impression that they go to things because they want the attention to be centered on them.\n\n\"You see and be seen. This has always been part of the way, Hollywood A-listers can disport themselves because they're news simply by turning up.\n\n\"You get the impression that the Sussexes, where they were on the Times 100 most influential people's listed 2021, might very well not be on that list were it to be drawn up now because they haven't really achieved that much.\n\n\"Put it this way, I doubt Hollywood A-listers are that impressed by what they have achieved.\"\n\nHe added: \"But what you don't find is Harry and Megan confident enough to appear just for the sake of it, as opposed to appearing when the focus is just on them.\n\n\"They have to have the confidence to appear when the spotlight isn't on them, and I don't think they've got that yet.\"\n\nThe Sun has approached the Sussexes for comment.\n\nRichard was speaking as Harry touched down in the UK - and revealed he has no plans to see his father while here.\n\nA spokesperson for Harry responded to \"speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week\".\n\nThey said: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry and Charles last reunited at Clarence House in February for their first face-to-face meeting in 16 months.\n\nThe prince flew to the UK alone without Meghan or their children Archie and Lilibet.\n\nBut Meghan will join Harry on his visit to Nigeria later this week, it's understood.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jane_matthews@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Jane Matthews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Bush_Hager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Bush Hager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Event_Planning_and_Production", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Event Planning and Production", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/crop-27778598.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

attacks & cashing in'", "body": "MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry have ruined Charles' first year as king, a royal expert has claimed.\n\nToday marks 12 months since the Monarch's coronation - where the nation came to a standstill then celebrated the newly crowned royal.\n\nIt's been a rollercoaster of a year for the Firm - from dozens of royal engagements to King Charles and Princess Kate announcing their cancer battles.\n\nBut alongside all of that, the Royal Family has been dodging bombs lobbed at them by Meghan and Harry.\n\nThe Sussexes have now been accused of launching unfair attacks on the Royal Family, while cashing in on their ties to the Firm.\n\nAnd it's those factors that royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams says has ruined Charles first year as king.\n\nHe said the Sussexes being evicted from Frogmore Cottage saw them retaliate.\n\nRichard told The Sun: \"The facts simply are with Harry and Megan that after Spare enough was enough so he had them evicted from Frogmore Cottage, and I don't think they expected it.\n\n\"And they certainly didn't like it.\n\n\"But the revelations in Spare, and not only the attacks on the Royal Family in that book and in the interviews surrounding it, which large numbers of people, watched, of course that Harry was responsible for, and it was his memoir.\"\n\nThe expert said that while Spare had been released the year prior, the wake of it was still having an impact on the king's reign.\n\nRichard continued: \"Spare was so badly planned you felt that he'd not had advice, but to attack Queen Camilla was clearly a red line, as was pointed out by the press that he's so hostile to.\n\n\"Therefore it was important that the King acted as he did.\"\n\nRichard also accused Harry and Meghan of \"monetising on their links to the Royal Family\".\n\nHe added: \"There's no doubt that evicting the Sussexes from their domicile in the UK was something that showed immense royal displeasure.\n\n\"And, I think it was absolutely right to have done it.\n\n\"There's also no doubt that the row with her with Omid Scobie later in the year and all of that was also very, very unhelpful.\n\n\"But what one's not going to get now and the Sussex is they monetize their connections with the Royal Family.\"\n\nHe added: \"They will forever, it seems, be in the news and precisely how they behave and what they decide to do a matter for them obviously.\"\n\nThe Sun has approached the Sussexes and Buckingham Palace for comment.\n\nRichard was speaking as it was revealed Harry and Charles are set to have another reunion.\n\nThe duke will be at St Paul's Cathedral for an Invictus Games ceremony and is understood to be \"very keen\" to see his dad.\n\nThey chatted for 30 minutes in February -- days after the King's cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe King, 75, recently cleared to resume public duties as he is treated for cancer, is expected to attend the year's first Buckingham Palace garden party from 4pm.\n\nBoth events will finish around 6pm, clearing the way for a first meeting since Harry's whistle-stop trip in early February.\n\nA royal source told The Sun: \"Harry is normally 5,000 miles away in California but by happy coincidence on Wednesday they will be just two miles apart.\n\n\"It's clear he is keen to see his father as he continues his recovery and most people expect another reunion of some kind next week.\"", "source":

In 2023, Harry said that part of the intention behind writing his memoir, Spare, was to dispel the long-held belief that both he and William were close during their childhood and adolescence.\n\nWilliam did not respond to the book or his brother's claims, in line with a blanket \"no comment\" position adopted by Buckingham Palace at the time of its publication.\n\nIn the absence of any public interactions between the brothers since 2022, fans have taken to social media to share clips and photographs from past public and private engagements depicting their connection.\n\nUploaded to TikTok by user @windsorofficiel, on April 28, a compilation of clips showing touching moments between William and Harry has gone viral, gaining over 150,000 views on the platform so far.\n\nOne of the main clips used shows the brothers at Harry's 2018 wedding to Meghan Markle that took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor, the same location where King Charles III and Queen Camilla had their marriage blessing 13 years earlier.\n\nWilliam stood as his brother's second at the high altar of the chapel as they awaited the arrival of the bride, a role Harry played at William's wedding to Princess Kate in 2011.\n\nAlso included in the video is footage from Harry's 1984 christening, which was held at Windsor Castle. In the clip, two-year-old William is seen sitting next to his brother, as King Charles points out the historic christening gown being worn by Harry -- who is held by Princess Diana.\n\nAnother touching clip shows the brothers on one of the most difficult days of their lives, that of their mother's funeral in September 1997.\n\nAfter Diana's tragic death at the age of 36 following a high-speed Paris car crash, her sons (Harry, 12, and William, 15) walked behind her coffin in a funeral procession from St James's Palace to Westminster Abbey.\n\nCaptioned \"Brothers \u2764\ufe0f,\" the TikTok video has received in excess of 5,000 likes and numerous comments, many of which have discussed the princes' relationship today and how it has developed.\n\n\"I hope that one day both brothers heal because they have been [through] so much \u2764\ufe0f,\" wrote one user.\n\n\"I would never thought that this could happen to these brothers, so so sad \ud83d\ude22,\" posted another, with a further comment reading: \"I pray these two brothers can heal from the past and reunite, princess Diana would be so happy seeing them together again \ud83d\udc9e.\"\n\nThe last time the brothers were photographed together in public was during the state funeral for Queen Elizabeth II in 2022. Harry attended his father, King Charles III's coronation in 2023, however, he did not interact with William in public.\n\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

But during a roundtable discussion with Mills of London's Honorable Artillery Company, the prince said that when they began planning for the 2014 Games, he wasn't sure it would work.\n\nHarry mentioned that he first came up with the idea for the Games during a trip to the United States in 2012, where he attended the Department of Defense's Warrior Games. Sports was the magic I witnessed, he said. Having just returned from Afghanistan myself, I saw the wounded and the sick and I saw the effect it had on all the families, and the weight of defense and individuals and programs. rehabilitation. There just wasn't enough work.\n\nOn his return to England, Harry decided he wanted to expand on the Warrior Games model, which had been stolen from the Americans and made bigger and better, as he described it. He contacted Mills and over a cup of tea they decided to embark on the project. We had this idea and not much else, frankly, Mills said of the first months of work on the Games. At the time it wasn't called the Invictus Games, we didn't have any money, we didn't have anyone. We just had a really good idea.\n\nThings finally fell into place when Harry arranged a meeting with someone who could help him. The next cup of tea hosted by Prince Harry was a cup of tea with Boris Johnson, myself and Prince Harry, Mills said. Former Prime Minister Johnson, then Mayor of London, controlled the facilities used during the Olympics. He twisted Boris Johnson's arm violently enough to allow us free use of all the facilities at the Olympic Park.\n\nThis favor allowed Harry and Mills to move forward, and the first Invictus Games took place September 10-14, 2014. We brought in a huge number of people who did much more than what would normally be possible to make the first plays, none of us really knowing where the first plays were going to take us, Mills continued. But the success was phenomenal and that's why we were all here today.\n\nDuring the panel, Harry mentioned that the Invictus Foundation decided early on that the families of injured veterans should be included in the event, adding that he loved hearing their stories.\n\nI had moms, I had dads, I had grandparents, he said, speaking of the families who moved him the most. Children came to shake my leg and thank me at the foundation for bringing dad back, for helping mom. It's a real thing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harry is expected to join a service of thanksgiving in honor of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral alongside the actor Damien Lewis, who will read the poem from which the event takes its name. However, he will not see his father, King Charles III, during his two-day trip to the United Kingdom.\n\n\"This will unfortunately not be possible due to Her Majesty's full schedule,\" Harry's spokesperson said. the New York Post Tuesday.

Majesty's full programme.\"\n\nThe event will take place in front of an Apache -- the type of helicopter Harry flew when serving in Afghanistan.\n\nWilliam, who flew with the Air Ambulance, will also take to the skies in the chopper.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"Timing is everything.\"\n\nSources claim Harry made multiple attempts to arrange a meeting with his dad before flying 5,000 miles for three days in the UK.\n\nHe was driven to the Honourable Artillery Company HQ in Shoreditch, East London for an Invictus Games discussion.\n\nHe was pictured smiling as he left there just after 6pm.\n\nEarlier in the day the King spoke to Fiji's Sitiveni Rabuka at the Palace.\n\nAt 2pm, the Office of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced Harry would not meet his father.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment or respond.\n\nSoon after, the Palace announced the date for William to take charge of the Army Air Corps, to which Harry was attached for his second tour of Afghanistan until 2014.\n\nWilliam's role had been announced in August.\n\nYesterday it was confirmed the ceremony will take place next Monday at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, Hants.\n\nThe King will walk to the control tower and officially pass the role of Colonel-in-Chief, which he held for 31 years, to William.\n\nThe Prince of Wales will then receive a briefing on the Corps' work from the Colonel Commandant, Lt-Gen Sir Nicholas Borton.\n\nWilliam will view a training drill and take controls of the Apache for a flight.\n\nToday, Charles and Harry will be two miles apart as the Duke attends an Invictus Games celebration at St Paul's Cathedral from 5pm.\n\nThe pair's diaries also fail to align tomorrow when Harry has \"private meetings\" and the King is understood to have an engagement in Windsor.\n\nAt the end of the week Harry, who is said to be staying in a hotel, will be joined by wife Meghan for a trip to Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, William will be in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nHarry passed his Army Air Corps grading and Pilot's Selection Board interview in December 2008 to begin pilot training in January 2009.\n\nOn his first tour of Afghanistan in 2008 he called in air strikes on Taliban positions.\n\nHe later qualified as an Apache commander in 2012 after three years of training.\n\nThen he spent a five-month tour in Afghanistan where he piloted an Apache.\n\nHarry wrote glowingly about the 'copter in his memoir Spare, saying: \"What a privilege, I thought, to experience this kind of raw power, and to put it to work for our side.\"\n\nBut he sparked outrage when he revealed he had killed 25 enemy fighters, writing: \"I didn't think of those 25 as people.\n\n\"They were chess pieces removed from the board.\n\n\"Bad people eliminated before they could kill good people.\"\n\nIn January, Harry was honoured in Los Angeles in the 21st Annual Living Legends of Aviation Awards alongside John Travolta.\n\nWilliam served in the Army as a Platoon Commander in The Blues and Royals, before completing flying training in the Royal Air Force.\n\nHe spent three years as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot in Anglesey, North Wales, before working as an Air Ambulance pilot in East Anglia for two years.\n\nHe has remained in the cockpit to keep his piloting hours up to retain his licence.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk",

The Sussexes reside in Montecito, California, often rubbing shoulders with the great and good of Hollywood, so fans were anticipating their Met Gala debut.\n\nBut the Sussexes did not show up, with them otherwise engaged. The couple was busy with good reason though, after all, on Monday it was their only son's fifth birthday, and they likely celebrated in a big way at their Montecito mansion.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Royal Family snub Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son Archie on his 5th birthday\n\nThe Sussexes did not attend the Met Gala 2024 The couple would have turned heads had they have attended\n\nNot only this, but Prince Harry has a big work commitment this week, with him due to fly from America to England today so that he can attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The Duke is expected to give a reading at the event for the games that he co-founded back in 2014, which are an event for injured and sick military personnel and veterans.\n\nSoon after Harry's trip back to his home country, Harry and Meghan will fly to West Africa for a trip to Nigeria. The couple accepted an invitation from Nigeria's Chief of Defense Staff to visit the country this month. The exact dates of their May trip are yet to be unveiled.\n\nNot only have the couple been busy with Prince Archie's birthday and their pending travels, but they are very busy behind-the-scenes too, working on various projects. Meghan teased her brand, American Riviera Orchard, back in March, with the Duchess having recently gifted some jam to 50 celebrities ahead of the hard-launch of the lifestyle brand.\n\nThe couple are also working with Netflix on two upcoming shows.

You have reached into the darkest recesses of their lives when they have literally nowhere else to turn, and you have transformed their existence.\n\n\"Yes, it is about sports, but then again, it's not really.

The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry has travelled to London to mark the 10th anniversary of his Paralympic-style Invictus Games tournament for wounded veterans and serving military.\n\nMs Seward told GB News: \"I think there's a huge issue over trust. As I said, I mean, Harry's already told us that his father's too busy to see him, which isn't a very isn't a very nice thing to say. Better left unsaid, he could. He could have said, 'You know, we're unfortunately, we've both got back to back appointments and it's not going to work this time, but I'll see him soon. I'll be going up to Scotland in the summer. Spend some quality time with him.'\"\n\nHost Andrew Pierce said: \"It was quite interesting because his Harry's office put that statement out yesterday saying just that, Um uh that Harry hoped to see his father, but his father's diary didn't allow it.\" Ingrid replied: \"If Harry had said, you know, I got them to word it a little differently. He could have said he'd hoped to see his father, but unfortunately, they were both too busy. It would have been a rather kinder sort of remark. \"\n\n\"I think everything can be fixed if you want it to. But the longer they leave it, the more awkward it's going to get. And the more time you're going to need to mend it. So I feel that well, I think it can be fixed, and I think it will be fixed, but I don't think it will be fixed right now.\"\n\nShe speculated that Harry could already have seen Kate: \"TYhe thing that does actually surprise me is that Harry he hasn't seen Kate because he was very, very close to Kate. I know he's insulted her, but she seems to be like a very level headed, forgiving sort of lady. And I mean, maybe he has. Maybe he's staying down down near Windsor. Maybe he's staying at Power Park where he stayed before.\"\n\nShe also said she believes as a Christian, King Charles has forgiven Harry: \"I don't believe for one minute that Charles has cut Harry out of his life or or not forgiven him because he's a very religious man and you know, religion is all about forgiveness. I don't I think he has forgiven him.

The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nReports have appeared in recent years of the pair's strained relationship after the Duke stepped down as a working royal and moved to America with his wife, Meghan, and their family. However, Harry has suggested the diagnosis could lead to a reconcilliation with his father.\n\nIn a Good Morning America interview, it was suggested a family illness could have a \"reunifying effect\", and when Harry was asked \"Is that possible in this case?\" he replied: \"Yeah, I'm sure.\"\n\nDuring a one-day summit in the capital that reflected the anniversary of the Invictus Games, Harry said there is still \"so much more to do\". He told delegates at the event, held at the Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters on the edge of the City of London: \"Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'.\n\n\"But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty - but what we've created is a global community.\"\n\nThe Duke, who was joined onstage by Sir Keith Mills, the former Invictus Games Foundation chairman, said whenever he was asked how long Invictus will last, his reply was \"as long as it's serving a purpose\".\n\nHe added: \"The root cause of the problem is conflict and I can't fix that.\n\n\"So we will always be here to be able to spread the message, tell the stories, change the perspectives and help as many people as humanly possible, because Invictus transcends borders, transcends politics.\"\n\nJohnny Mercer, minister for veterans' affairs, attended one of the final sessions of the day and praised the work of the Invictus delegates in supporting competitors, adding: \"The power of sport in recovery has been well known for a long time, but your determination to take it to the next level has been unmatched.\n\n\"I cannot adequately express to you here today the sheer power of what you have done. You have reached into the darkest recesses of their lives when they have literally nowhere else to turn, and you have transformed their existence.\n\n\"Yes, it is about sports, but then again, it's not really. It's about a common humanity. Man's conduct to fellow man - you set the standard for humility, for courage, for determination, the absolute resolve never to quit.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_isgin@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Kieran Isgin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honourable_Artillery_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honourable Artillery Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City of London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "City of London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mercer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Mercer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29127857.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-IGF-Conversation-Realising-a-Global-Community.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

attacks & cashing in'", "body": "MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry have ruined Charles' first year as king, a royal expert has claimed.\n\nToday marks 12 months since the Monarch's coronation - where the nation came to a standstill then celebrated the newly crowned royal.\n\nIt's been a rollercoaster of a year for the Firm - from dozens of royal engagements to King Charles and Princess Kate announcing their cancer battles.\n\nBut alongside all of that, the Royal Family has been dodging bombs lobbed at them by Meghan and Harry.\n\nThe Sussexes have now been accused of launching unfair attacks on the Royal Family, while cashing in on their ties to the Firm.\n\nAnd it's those factors that royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams says has ruined Charles first year as king.\n\nHe said the Sussexes being evicted from Frogmore Cottage saw them retaliate.\n\nRichard told The Sun: \"The facts simply are with Harry and Megan that after Spare enough was enough so he had them evicted from Frogmore Cottage, and I don't think they expected it.\n\n\"And they certainly didn't like it.\n\n\"But the revelations in Spare, and not only the attacks on the Royal Family in that book and in the interviews surrounding it, which large numbers of people, watched, of course that Harry was responsible for, and it was his memoir.\"\n\nThe expert said that while Spare had been released the year prior, the wake of it was still having an impact on the king's reign.\n\nRichard continued: \"Spare was so badly planned you felt that he'd not had advice, but to attack Queen Camilla was clearly a red line, as was pointed out by the press that he's so hostile to.\n\n\"Therefore it was important that the King acted as he did.\"\n\nRichard also accused Harry and Meghan of \"monetising on their links to the Royal Family\".\n\nHe added: \"There's no doubt that evicting the Sussexes from their domicile in the UK was something that showed immense royal displeasure.\n\n\"And, I think it was absolutely right to have done it.\n\n\"There's also no doubt that the row with her with Omid Scobie later in the year and all of that was also very, very unhelpful.\n\n\"But what one's not going to get now and the Sussex is they monetize their connections with the Royal Family.\"\n\nHe added: \"They will forever, it seems, be in the news and precisely how they behave and what they decide to do a matter for them obviously.\"\n\nThe Sun has approached the Sussexes and Buckingham Palace for comment.\n\nRichard was speaking as it was revealed Harry and Charles are set to have another reunion.\n\nThe duke will be at St Paul's Cathedral for an Invictus Games ceremony and is understood to be \"very keen\" to see his dad.\n\nBoth events will finish around 6pm, clearing the way for a first meeting since Harry's whistle-stop trip in early February.\n\nA royal source told The Sun: \"Harry is normally 5,000 miles away in California but by happy coincidence on Wednesday they will be just two miles apart.\n\n\"It's clear he is keen to see his father as he continues his recovery and most people expect another reunion of some kind next week.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType":

Meghan, in particular, is doing a lifestyle show for the streaming company that will include cooking and gardening.

Anna Wintour's Real Feelings About Her Revealed", "body": "One of the biggest questions for spring's biggest night. A question that some Royal fans have in mind is if Meghan Markle is attending the 2024 Met Gala. The Duchess of Sussex just released her new American Riviera Orchard brand and is making moves with her new Netflix ventures, will that mean that she's attending Fashion's Biggest Night?\n\nCelebrities from across the globe are invited by Vogue's Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour to grace the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of New York. However, not everyone can attain an invite just like that; only around 600 people make the list each year. This year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" which will showcase some rare fashion pieces, but will rare celebrities come out to celebrate the event?\n\nMeghan Markle isn't confirmed to attend the 2024 Met Gala. With Harry going to England for the Invictus Games and Archie's birthday coming up, it's likely that she will skip out.\n\nA source divulged to Page Six that a missing invite doesn't mean that Anna hates them. \"It's Anna's party, and just because you're not invited doesn't mean she doesn't like you necessarily - you may not be up to her fashion standards.\"\n\nFor what Anna Wintour actually thinks of Meghan Markle, she has been praising her ever since her wedding. In her Vogue series Go Ask Anna, she said, \"I read somewhere that there were members of the royal household that were confused and upset that she woke up so early, at 5 a.m. She's a normal California girl who gets up early and does yoga and meditates. She also sent a lot of text messages. I mean, what did they expect? That she was going to send messages via pigeon? I think she's amazing.\" She also adored her wedding to Prince Harry, \"The royal wedding had the whole world watching, and I think that her choice was brilliant. It was sophisticated, it was chic, it was grown up.\"\n\nIt's not known whether or not Prince Harry will be attending the Met Gala until the event is in full effect. However, it might interfere with his trip back to the UK. The Duke of Sussex is scheduled to make an appearance at the Invictus Games on May 8, 2024. According to ITV News's royal editor, Chris Ship, the king would likely \"find a gap\" in his schedule to see his son amid his cancer diagnosis. \"When he comes, he will probably see his dad,\" Ship said.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, on \"Wednesday, [Charles] will have his weekly audience with the Prime Minister before he hopes to attend the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season.\"\n\nThere are high hopes for a meeting, with royal expert Tom Quinn adding that \"It's going to be very difficult for Harry to come to the UK and not visit his stricken father, King Charles.\"", "source": {"uri": "stylecaster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StyleCaster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lea_veloso@stylecaster.com", "name": "Lea Veloso", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Riviera"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Households_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Households of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_William_and_Catherine_Middleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/meghan-markle-met-gala-2024_21f958.jpg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The Duchess of Sussex is not coming with him to the service or to England. Meghan will fly out of the US later in the week to meet up with Harry in Nigeria, at the invitation of the Nigerian government and Nigeria's Ministry of Defense. The British media is extremely salty about Meghan's refusal to come back to them so they can abuse her. The British media and the Windsors are very mad that every time Meghan publicly snubs them, they look like abusive jackasses on the world stage. Thus, there's been an effort to rewrite Meghan's motives for why she's choosing not to play their ridiculous games. We saw this last year, around the coronation, which Meghan made a point of snubbing. Now the Express has gotten quotes from \"a senior aide\" at Buckingham Palace who thinks Meghan's \"conspicuous absence\" on this trip is a missed opportunity to \"support her father-in-law.\" Curious.\n\nMeghan Markle will snub the UK as sources say she is \"done\" with the country because she \"doesn't want the drama\" of dealing with the Royal Family.\n\nPrince Harry will fly alone to the UK to attend a Wednesday afternoon service at St. Paul's Cathedral to mark the tenth anniversary of his Invictus Games before privately meeting King Charles afterwards. The Duchess of Sussex will, however, jet out of LA the following day to join Harry in Nigeria for talks with leaders of the West African nation about hosting future Invictus events for injured military personnel. The couple's spokesman confirmed she will not accompany her husband to St. Paul's and will completely bypass the London leg of his trip, staying home with their children following a planned fifth birthday party on Monday for Prince Archie.\n\nBut her snub comes after sources close to the Duchess have previously been quoted as saying she is \"done\" with the UK and \"doesn't want the drama\" of having to deal with the Royal Family.\n\nBuckingham Palace has declined to formally comment about Harry's visit but one senior aide observed: \"Her conspicuous absence from all his recent trips has been noted. This time she will be missing a key event in Harry's Invictus diary as well as the opportunity to offer support to her father-in-law.\"\n\nMeghan, 42, is also preparing for the imminent launch of her new lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard with a planned media blitz that is likely to include a string of \"soft\" interviews on daytime TV chat shows.\n\nBut the aide added: \"It strikes me as odd that she doesn't have time to come to England where, however she feels about them, she does have family. But she does have time to join Harry in Africa. I think that speaks volumes.\"\n\n[From The Daily Express]\n\nHere's the thing: they're trying to publicly guilt-trip Meghan - \"why would you miss such an important event for your husband\" - while at the same time, they're drawing attention to their history of abusing this poor woman. Do they know they're doing that? Do they know that people are like \"why would Meghan not return for the Invictus service, oh I know why, it's because Harry's dogsh-t family treated her like sh-t and it's not safe for her and the press would attack her for weeks no matter what.\"\n\n\"As well as the opportunity to offer support to her father-in-law...\" plus \"she doesn't have time to come to England where, however she feels about them, she does have family.\" A father-in-law who had concerns about her children's skin color, a father-in-law who evicted her children from their family home in the UK, a father-in-law who banned her from coming to Scotland to support her husband then bragged about it in the press, a father-in-law who offered zero support to her during the most difficult phase of her life? That's the dogsh-t father-in-law she's supposed to support? Clearly, Meghan does NOT believe she has any \"family\" in the UK.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Records", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Blitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Riviera"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The mother of three has not had any public events since December.\n\nHer husband, Prince William, has returned to public engagements after a brief period away.\n\nHarry and his wife, Meghan Markle, privately reached out to his brother and sister-in-law, as well as sharing a joint statement in support of Kate. In a statement to ET, the couple said, \"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.\"\n\nCharlies returned to his official royal duties amid his ongoing health battle last month. On April 26, Buckingham Palace announced that the 75-year-old British monarch plans to \"return to public-facing duties after a period of treatment and recuperation following his recent cancer diagnosis.\"\n\nThe palace added that Charles will make \"a number\" of public events in the next few weeks, including hosting the Emperor and Empress of Japan for a state visit in June.\n\n\"As the first anniversary of the Coronation approaches, Their Majesties remain deeply grateful for the many kindnesses and good wishes they have received from around the world throughout the joys and challenges of the past year,\" the palace shared in a statement.\n\nHarry is currently in the U.K. to attend celebrations for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, which had its inaugural competition for wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veterans 10 years ago in London.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emperor of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-02/ETD_SHOWCLIP_A04%20PRINCE%20HARRY_021624_VIDPIC.jpg?h=d1cb525d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2711, "textEnd": 2719}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Editor in Chief of Majesty Magazine and Royal Biographer, Ingrid Seward, speaking on GB News said that the statement released by Harry's spokesperson yesterday could have been worded more kindly.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry has travelled to London to mark the 10th anniversary of his Paralympic-style Invictus Games tournament for wounded veterans and serving military.\n\nMs Seward told GB News: \"I think there's a huge issue over trust. As I said, I mean, Harry's already told us that his father's too busy to see him, which isn't a very isn't a very nice thing to say. Better left unsaid, he could. He could have said, 'You know, we're unfortunately, we've both got back to back appointments and it's not going to work this time, but I'll see him soon. I'll be going up to Scotland in the summer. Spend some quality time with him.'\"\n\nHost Andrew Pierce said: \"It was quite interesting because his Harry's office put that statement out yesterday saying just that, Um uh that Harry hoped to see his father, but his father's diary didn't allow it.\" Ingrid replied: \"If Harry had said, you know, I got them to word it a little differently. He could have said he'd hoped to see his father, but unfortunately, they were both too busy. It would have been a rather kinder sort of remark. \"\n\n\"I think everything can be fixed if you want it to. But the longer they leave it, the more awkward it's going to get. And the more time you're going to need to mend it. So I feel that well, I think it can be fixed, and I think it will be fixed, but I don't think it will be fixed right now.\"\n\nShe speculated that Harry could already have seen Kate: \"TYhe thing that does actually surprise me is that Harry he hasn't seen Kate because he was very, very close to Kate. I know he's insulted her, but she seems to be like a very level headed, forgiving sort of lady. And I mean, maybe he has. Maybe he's staying down down near Windsor. Maybe he's staying at Power Park where he stayed before.\"\n\nShe also said she believes as a Christian, King Charles has forgiven Harry: \"I don't believe for one minute that Charles has cut Harry out of his life or or not forgiven him because he's a very religious man and you know, religion is all about forgiveness. I don't I think he has forgiven him. I think he's probably very wary of seeing him, but I don't think it's because he's cut Harry out of his light.\"", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_hurst@bristolpost.co.uk", "name": "Ben Hurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9271176.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-IGF-Conversation-Realising-a-Global-Community.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

But during a panel discussion with Mills at London's Honourable Artillery Company, the prince said when they first started planning for the 2014 Games, he wasn't positive that it was going to work out.\n\nHarry mentioned that he first got the idea for the Games during a 2012 trip to the United States, where he attended the Department of Defense's Warrior Games. \"Sport was the magic that I witnessed,\" he said. \"Having just come back from Afghanistan myself, seeing the wounded, injured and sick and seeing the effect this was having on all the families, and just the weight -- the load on defense and on the individuals and on the rehabilitation programs. There just wasn't enough being done.\"\n\nUpon his return to England, Harry decided he wanted to expand on the Warrior Games model -- it was \"stolen from the Americans and made bigger and better,\" as he described it. He reached out to Mills, and over a cup of tea, they decided to take the project on. \"We had this idea and not much else, frankly,\" Mills said of the early months of work on the Games. \"It wasn't called the Invictus Games then, we had no money, we had no people. We just had a very good idea.\"\n\nThings finally came together when Harry arranged a meeting with someone in the position to help. \"The next cup of tea Prince Harry organized was a cup of tea with Boris Johnson, myself, and Prince Harry,\" Mills said. Former Prime Minister Johnson, then mayor of London, had control over the facilities used during the Olympics. \"He twisted Boris Johnson's arm quite hard to allow us to use all the facilities in the Olympic Park at no cost.\"\n\nThat favor allowed Harry and Mills to go forward, and the first Invictus Games were held from September 10 to 14, 2014. \"We called on a huge number of people who went way beyond what would normally be possible to pull off the first games, none of us really knowing where the first games was going to take us,\" Mills continued. \"But it was phenomenally successful and that's the reason we're all here today.\"\n\nDuring the panel, Harry mentioned that early on the Invictus Foundation decided that the families of wounded veterans needed to be included in the event, adding that he loved to hear their stories.\n\n\"I've had moms, I've had dads, I've had grandparents,\" he said, speaking about the families that have moved him most. \"I've had kids come up, hug my leg and thank me -- thank us at the foundation for bringing Daddy back, for helping Mommy out. It's a real thing.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Harry is set to join a service of thanksgiving in honor of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral alongside actor Damian Lewis, who will read the poem from which the event got its name. He will not, however, see his father, King Charles III, during his two-day trip to the UK.\n\n\"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" Harry's spokesperson told the New York Post on Tuesday. \"The duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keith Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warrior Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honourable_Artillery_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honourable Artillery Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_Olympic_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/663a99f206a4911d2b9ccff4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/The%20IGF%20Conversation,%20realising%20a%20Global%20community..JPG?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-09-10", "dateEnd": "2014-09-14", "textStart": 2119, "textEnd": 2143}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

People reported that Meghan and Harry are privately celebrating their son's fifth birthday today before Harry leaves for London.\n\nMeghan will be joining Harry later this month for their trip to Nigeria.

Father and son have not yet bridged the gap, and Charles is reportedly 'devastated' over the breakdown of their bond, says the king's former butler.\n\nKing Charles' former butler, Grant Harrold, discussed how he believes the monarch is reacting to remaining separate from Prince Harry. He told GBNews the king is \"devastated.\"\n\n'I have absolutely no doubt that, as far as that's concerned, [Charles] will be devastated by the fact that their relationship wasn't like it used to be when I was there. They were very close,' Harrold explains.\n\n\"Seeing and following what's happened over the past couple of years is upsetting because they were very close,\" he continued. \"Harry is probably on his mind on a daily basis.\"\n\nHarrold was a member of the royal household of King Charles III and Camilla Parker Bowles, based at their country Highgrove House. He was a butler for Charles and Camilla, Prince William, Kate Middleton, and Prince Harry from 2004 to 2011.\n\nPrince Harry shared some scathing commentary about King Charles' wife, Camilla Parker Bowles, between the pages of his autobiography Spare. He claims Camilla \"sacrificed\" him on \"her personal P.R. altar.\" and called her \"dangerous\" at another time.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" says Grant Harrold. You can't put something like that in a book and expect everything to be fine.\"\n\n\"It's hurtful. However, for me, it's very confusing,\" he added.\n\n\"I always thought they got on and to say that those thoughts and feelings weren't there, but I never witnessed any of that,\" Harrold concluded. \"Sadly, it came to this: a family that isn't as united as it once was.\"\n\nAlthough it seems strange to royal outsiders that King Charles and Prince Harry wouldn't see each other when father and son were both in the same town, to Grant Harrold, their separation could be a matter of scheduling. Their work diaries may not coincide with each other.\n\n\"The king has returned to his royal duties,\" Harrold explains. \"His diary may be filled because he's only doing certain things at a time.\"\n\n\"Most of us might think, 'Harry's in the country. [Charles} may want the possibility of seeing him. However, their diaries could be clashing.\"\n\n\"The question beneath the surface is that there is this continued fallout as Prince William is also not going to see his brother,\" Harrold continued. Neither of them are going to attend the service at St. Paul's Cathedral [for the Invictus Games].\"\n\n\"Normally, when families are in a country, they want to see each other. Although it seems strange, it isn't completely impossible that it's because of work.\"\n\nPrince Harry will appear at St. Paul's Cathedral to celebrate the Invictus Games' 10th anniversary. No members of the royal family will attend the service.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucille_barilla@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lucille Barilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Harrold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grant Harrold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Households_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Households of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highgrove_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Highgrove House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/king-charles-prince-harry-4.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The former Suits star is a constant topic of conversation in the media and among fans on social media. However, reports of her claims about speaking to Harry's late mother, Princess Diana, are leaving many cringing. The Duchess of Sussex was reportedly overheard telling her husband that she had an encounter with his beloved mother from beyond the grave in the middle of a yoga session back in 2022. Now, royal reporter Kinsey Schofield is telling all.\n\nSchofield sat down for an interview with the Outspoken Uncancelled podcast and revealed some bizarre news about Meghan Markle. The reporter claims that in 2022 when Meghan and Harry were celebrating Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee, the former actress told Prince Harry that she spoke to his mother, Princess Diana. Meanwhile, Harry's cousin, Princess Beatrice, was said to overhear the conversation, per In Touch.\n\n\"At the Queen's Platinum Jubilee when Harry and Meghan were in that room, we kind of saw them peeking out, allegedly Beatrice overheard Meghan say to Prince Harry: 'Your mom talked to me this morning during yoga, and she's really glad that we're here,'\" Schofield said.\n\nKinsey Schofield then went on to share her thoughts about Meghan and Harry's relationship. The reporter says she believes that Markle is using Harry's love for his late mother to her advantage. She added that Meghan manipulates Harry and uses her acting skills to do so.\n\n\"When Meghan realized she had this in with Prince Harry she went into actress mode and started studying her character and that character being Princess Diana,\" the royal expert continued. \"She knew what she wanted. Meghan has always pursued men to elevate her, whether it be with Trevor (Engelson, her ex-husband) in Hollywood or whether it be the chef in Toronto,\" Schofield stated.\n\nOf course, fans were stunned by the claims. \"She has Harry believing she is Princess Diana and his demented mind he REALLY REALLY REALLY believes her,\" one person said on Twitter. \"Princess Diana would have so disliked Meghan Markle. She would have seen through the bulls -- within seconds,\" another commented. \"Wow...if true, there's no depth to which she won't sink,\" a third social media user wrote. \"She will say and do ANYTHING for attention,\" another Twitter user quipped.\n\nMeanwhile, the claims of Meghan Markle allegedly speaking to the late Princess Diana have not been confirmed.

News of this special meeting comes just as King Charles will not be able to meet his youngest son Prince Harry during his brief visit to the UK this week.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 39, arrived in the UK on Tuesday ahead of the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, which he will mark at a ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday.\n\nHELLO! understands the Duke will not meet with his father during his visit to the UK this week \"due to His Majesty's full programme\". A source said: \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nOn the topic of the father-and-son not being able to meet, HELLO!'s Royal Editor, Emily Nash, said: \"To an outsider it may seem odd that they can't make time for a meeting, but the King is head of state and has his diary planned months in advance - so it wasn't a given that it would happen, with Harry only here for a couple of days.\n\n\"It will inevitably lead to speculation over the state of their relationship, which has come under pressure over the past few years.\"\n\nThe last time King Charles and Prince Harry enjoyed a reunion was back in February, just moments after His Majesty announced his cancer diagnosis to the world.\n\nNext week's engagement with William, 42, will see King Charles unveiling a plaque which commemorates the arrival of the first Apache AH Mk.1 to be installed in a UK museum.\n\nAfter departing The Army Flying Museum, King Charles, 75, will walk across the airfield to the Middle Wallop Control Tower. Here, in front of an Apache, King Charles will be met by the Prince of Wales to officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nTogether, King Charles and Prince William will have an opportunity to meet serving aircrew in front of the Apache. After His Majesty has departed, Prince William will embark on his first engagement with the Army Air Corps as Colonel-in-Chief.\n\nThe Prince will first receive a briefing on the Army Air Corps' current work from the Colonel Commandant, Lieutenant General Sir Nicholas Borton. He will then view training and operational aircraft used by the Army Air Corps and meet the aircrew and the supporting ground staff.\n\nThe Prince will also hear from soldiers across a range of roles within the regiment that are involved in supporting operations. For the final part of his engagement, Prince William will depart the base by embarking on an Apache capability flight to deepen his understanding of the capabilities of the equipment and to learn more about the people that fly and support it.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharnaz_shahid@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Sharnaz Shahid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Flying_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army Flying Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commandant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Wallop", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle Wallop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middle Wallop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land Forces", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/aab1f71e5f9e-charles-william-harry.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 301, "textEnd": 307}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

That will be very telling -- if he doesn't mention Harry that will be odd.\"\n\nCharles will unveil a plaque relating to an Apache that was used in a battle during the Afghanistan War in 2007 and that is being exhibited in The Army Flying Museum, at Middle Wallop.\n\nHarry's first tour of Afghanistan began the same year, meaning Charles will have -- if he chooses to take it -- an opportunity to seamlessly tip his hat to his second son. Such a move would likely be interpreted as an olive branch publicly, though Seward suggested public opinion may not be at the forefront of his mind.\n\n\"Charles has probably lost a few points here but he will not play the scoring points game, he just won't,\" she said. \"Even if his advisers might have said 'the service might be a nice idea,' he will have said 'well, I'm not playing that game'.\"\n\nAfua Hagan was among those who had hoped Charles and Harry would meet prior to the announcement on Tuesday.\n\n'Missed Opportunity'\n\n\"I think it's a real shame actually that the two of them are not going to have any face time together,\" she said. \"Obviously the king is busy and he can't do too much because he's still under doctor's orders.\n\n\"The statement said that the duke understands but I do think it's a shame and it is a missed opportunity for both of them.\n\n\"It kind of feels like a bit of a snub and as far as we know at this point on Wednesday no one's attending the service for Invictus and it's a brilliant thing that Prince Harry has done.\n\n\"It's a passion project and an incredible legacy. The optics are terrible.\"\n\nHagan acknowledge some may feel \"the king and Camilla want to teach Harry a lesson,\" but added: \"The King is almost certainly not that petty, but he is at risk of looking petty.\"\n\n\"It's not a snub,\" Seward said. \"It's not intended to be unkind but it just doesn't look very good but then Charles won't play to the gallery, he never has done.\"\n\nJack Royston is Newsweek's chief royal correspondent based in London.

The event was hosted by Louise Minchin.\n\nDuring his chat onstage, Louise asked Harry to look back and reflect on a magic moment that made him smile. \"It probably hasn't changed, it has to be the beginning, 2014, in the Copper Box. I was at the DJ sets and trying to choose some of the music, put the lights on and get people on their feet,\" he recalled. Harry then said: \"And...is Guy in the house? Guy Monson? Are you here? No?

The page also states that in 1996 he \"pioneered the use of thematic investment in the management of global equity portfolios, resulting in the successful launch of the EquiSar family of funds\".\n\nMr Monson has been with his partner Olivia Monson since 1995, and he writes regularly in the international financial press and has made television appearances on CNBC, Bloomberg and other financial channels.\n\nHarry heading out for dinner with his pal comes after the Duke was seemingly left out in the cold by his family.

Kate and King Charles were identified in the Dutch translation of Omid Scobie's book 'Endgame'.\n\nThe publishers, Xander Uitgevers, have since withdrawn the books, stating to ABC News: \"An error occurred in the Dutch translation and is currently being rectified.\"\n\nOn another note, Harry's autobiography 'Spare' sheds light on a dispute involving the flower girl dress for Meghan's wedding. In it, Harry claims that contrary to newspaper reports, Kate had admitted to causing Meghan to cry rather than the other way around.\n\n\"Kate got things rolling straightaway by acknowledging that these stories in the papers about Meg making her cry were totally false,\" Harry wrote in his autobiography 'Spare'. He added, \"I know, Meghan, that I was the one who made you cry.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

He hosted the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season on Wednesday.\n\nCharles, wearing a grey suit and light blue waistcoat, could be seen smiling to the crowds as he entered the garden with the Queen. He was joined by the Princess Royal, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nCharles attended three events last week as he resumed engagements, indicating the positive effect of his treatment.\n\nOn Monday, the Lord President of the Privy Council, Penny Mordaunt, said the King is feeling \"very good\" and \"would have been so pleased\" to return to public-facing events. The Privy Council is a body of senior advisers to the King.\n\nAsked how Charles is doing, Ms Mordaunt told GB News: \"He's very good.

Prince William said the next day that Charlotte was \"very tired\" after \"making sure her little brother behaved himself\" at the event.\n\nPrincess Kate and Princess Charlotte had the ultimate mother-daughter matching moment at the coronation, sporting coordinating headpieces by Jess Collett x Alexander McQueen and similar white outfits by McQueen.\n\nThe stunning hair accessories nodded to the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth, looking similar to the ones worn by the late Queen's maids at her crowning.\n\n\"If they did take inspiration from those ornaments, it was a nice way to give Kate something that stood out visually while still reinforcing her current role as a supporter of the King and Queen,\" Lauren Kiehna of The Court Jeweller blog told PEOPLE.\n\nPrince George's role as a Page of Honor to his grandfather put him in the royal history books. He was the youngest future monarch to be officially involved in a coronation service, according to The Telegraph. (While 4-year-old Prince Charles was brought in to watch part of his mother Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953 and 11-year-old Princess Elizabeth witnessed the crowning ceremony of her father King George VI in 1937, neither participated.)\n\n\"His parents are very excited and delighted that he is a page,\" a spokesperson for the Prince and Princess of Wales told PEOPLE ahead of the event. \"It's something that his parents have thought long and hard about and are very much looking forward to -- and I'm sure George is too.\"\n\nAt just 5 years old, Prince Louis was likely the youngest attendee at his grandfather's coronation. The big day meant an early start -- and a few stray yawns from the little royal throughout the ceremony. At one point, Prince Louis was no longer sitting with his parents and sister -- but after a short break, he was back to ride in the carriage procession back to the palace!\n\nPrince Harry traveled solo to the U.K. from California, where he has lived since 2020 with Meghan Markle and their children, to see his father's coronation. The Duke of Sussex smiled as he walked in with his cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie as well as their husbands and took his seat in the third row. After the crowning ceremony, Harry headed to the airport to rush home for his son Prince Archie's birthday.\n\nAlthough King Charles became monarch immediately upon Queen Elizabeth's death in September 2022, he was officially crowned at the coronation. King Charles was enthroned with the commanding St. Edward's Crown, used only to crown a new monarch. It weighs nearly 5 lbs. and was first created for King Charles II in 1661 as a replacement for the previous crown that had been melted down in 1649.\n\nKing Charles actually wore two crowns on his coronation day. He swapped the St. Edward's Crown for the Imperial State Crown at the end of the service.\n\nWhile Queen Camilla's crown was steeped in royal history, her coronation gown was full of personal touches. Designed by Bruce Oldfield, the dress included her two rescue dogs, Bluebell and Beth, with gold embroidered Jack Russell Terriers near the trim. In addition to her royal cypher (also featured on her shoes!), the names of Camilla's children and grandchildren were also stitched into the regal gown.\n\nCamilla has already recycled the dress, wearing it to the State Opening of Parliament in November.\n\nAfter King Charles was crowned, his eldest son and heir stepped forward to pay homage in a memorable moment. The Prince of Wales knelt and said, \"I, William, Prince of Wales, pledge my loyalty to you and faith and truth I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God.\"\n\nHe then touched his father's crown and kissed his cheek, prompting King Charles to say what seemed to be, \"Thank you, William.\"\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla rode back to Buckingham Palace in style, leaving Westminster Abbey in the Gold State Coach. The historic carriage was constructed in 1762 and first used by King George III to travel to the State Opening of Parliament that year. The coach, which weighs four tons and was drawn by eight horses on the coronation day, has been used at every coronation since King William IV's crowning ceremony in 1831.\n\nKing Charles' sister, Princess Anne, was the only member of the royal family to ride on horseback during the post-crowning procession back to Buckingham Palace in her role as \"Gold-Stick-in-Waiting.\" The role, which Princess Anne has held since 1998, dates back to the 15th century when two officers, a Gold Stick and a Silver Stick, were placed close to the monarch to protect them from harm.\n\nIn an interview with CBC News that aired ahead of the event, Princess Anne joked about the perks of the job.\n\n\"I have a role as the Colonel of the Blues and Royals in the Household Cavalry regiment as Gold Stick [in Waiting]. And Gold Stick was the original close protection officer. So that is a role I was asked if I'd like to do for this coronation, so I said yes,\" she said. \"Not least of all, it solves my dress problem.\"\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales rode together with their three children in a horse-drawn carriage following the crowning ceremony.\n\nUpon their return to Buckingham Palace, King Charles and Queen Camilla stepped out onto the royal residence's iconic balcony.\n\nThe King and Queen were joined by members of the royal family, including their Pages of Honor.\n\nA snap taken from behind the royal couple shows a view of the flypast carried out by the Royal Air Force.\n\nThe day after the crowning ceremony, the royal family gathered on the grounds of Windsor Castle for the Coronation Concert! They were treated to performances by Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, Nicole Scherzinger, Olly Murs and more.\n\nPrince William had some fun with the Union Jack flags provided to the crowd, playfully waving them in his children's faces.\n\nThe Prince of Wales took the stage at the Coronation Concert for a special speech dedicated to his father.\n\nHe said, \"I want to say a few words about my father and why I believe this weekend is so important. But don't worry, unlike Lionel, I won't go on all night long,\" he joked in a nod to the \"All Night Long\" hitmaker, whose performance preceded his remarks.\n\n\"As my grandmother said when she was crowned, 'Coronations are a declaration of our hopes for the future,' \" Prince William said, quoting Queen Elizabeth's coronation speech from 1953. \"And I know she's up there, fondly keeping an eye on us. She would be a proud mother.\"\n\nIn a sweet touch, he said, \"Pa, we are all so proud of you.\"\n\nOn May 8, members of the royal family took part in a volunteering initiative called the Big Help Out. The Prince and Princess of Wales brought their children on a visit to the 3rd Upton Scout Group in Slough -- a cause close to Kate, who is the joint President of the Scout Association.\n\nThe family joined the Scouts to renovate their Scout Hut, taking part in plating, sanding and painting. Prince George used a drill to work on a project, while Princess Charlotte did some painting and Prince Louis shoveled dirt into a wheelbarrow. But they also enjoyed some roasted marshmallows.\n\nPrince Louis seemed to have a blast on his first official royal engagement -- and his reaction to biting into a s'more showed it!\n\nMuch has changed for the royal family since King Charles' coronation. In February, the monarch announced that he was diagnosed with cancer. Just weeks later, Princess Kate also revealed that she was also undergoing cancer treatment after post-operative tests from her January abdominal surgery found \"cancer had been present.\"\n\nWhile the Princess of Wales remains out of the public eye, the King recently stepped out for his first public engagement since the palace announced the health news, visiting the Macmillan Cancer Centre at the University College Hospital London on April 30 with Queen Camilla.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For the event, the newly divorced princess wore a daring lingerie inspired gown designed by John Galliano, the new creative director of the house of Dior.\n\nHarry's cousin, Princess Beatrice of York, is the second royal to have attended the gala. The eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah \"Fergie\" Ferguson, the Duchess of York, attended in 2018 where she wore a purple gown designed by Alberta Ferretti.\n\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London.

There's a certain sadness about this latest effort, since the Sussexes's entire past year has been spent branding and rebranding themselves with practically no effect, and the whiff of desperation now hovers over them.\n\nYou'd feel sorry for the couple if they responded to their misfortune with some degree of humility\n\nTheir annus horribilis of branding mishaps and misfortunes kicked off last April when Meghan signed up with the glitziest of the Hollywood PR giants -- William Morris Endeavor. At the time, the Sussex image was in sore need of a turnaround. The consensus had it that they were good at trashing the royal family -- via Oprah, Spare and Netflix -- but were struggling to prove themselves in any other way. This was unfortunate, as the victimhood narrative was a branding disaster. With the publication of Spare, Harry's approval ratings in the US dropped an alarming forty-five points to minus seven and Meghan's fell thirty-six points to minus thirteen. And this was before the disdainful South Park episode about their Worldwide Privacy Tour. It was starting to look like Meghan might not be able to run for president after all.\n\nThen, in May, the Sussexes made their historic pronouncement about a \"near catastrophic car chase\" in New York, invoking the image of the death of Diana and securing the bewilderment of New Yorkers from the mayor down, who wondered how a two-hour high-speed car chase could have happened in a city that is permanently gridlocked. This was another major fail; after all, if it looked as though they were telling fibs about this, what else might not be true? Even those who had believed what was said in the Oprah interview now had their doubts.\n\nA few weeks later, Spotify dropped Meghan's Archetypes podcast on the grounds that Archewell had failed to meet \"productivity benchmarks.\" That description was evidently a euphemism, as explained by Spotify executive Bill Simmons who said: \"The Fucking Grifters. That's the podcast we should have launched with them.\" He was expanding on sentiments he'd expressed before: \"You live in fucking Montecito and you just sell documentaries and podcasts and nobody cares what you have to say about anything unless you talk about the royal family and you just complain about them.\" Simmons was speaking to a growing majority on both sides of the Atlantic which, having turned against Harry and Meghan, was now hungry for every piece of bad news.\n\nBy the summer, the Sussexes's PR situation was dire. In June it was reported that Meghan was \"in talks\" to become a brand representative for the French fashion house Dior. Cue a wave of mean but amusing YouTube videos highlighting her many fashion fails. An army of Sussex-watchers sensed that the collaboration was everything that Meghan had ever wanted, and they didn't think she deserved it. Eventually, Dior denied having spoken to Meghan at all and instead chose Meg Bellamy as its new face. By chance, or not, this was the actress who played Kate Middleton in The Crown.\n\nBy the autumn, the phrase \"they're smashing plates in Montecito\" was all over the internet and the year ended badly. In the Netherlands, Omid Scobie's book Endgame named the \"royal racists\" of Oprah fame as King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales. In PR terms, this was horrendous for the Sussexes -- who were desperately trying to disassociate from family drama in order to move on to \"new projects.\" That both Charles and Catherine were afterwards diagnosed with cancer made everything a hundred times worse. In other frightful news, the Archewell Foundation accounts were made public, revealing that the couple put in only an hour's work a week at their charity -- deftly reinforcing the \"grifters\" moniker.\n\nAnd so it went on. Harry was caught up in a devastating scandal at the African Parks charity, of which he is a board member -- where employees stand accused of violence and rape. Simultaneously, the Duke was having patchy-to-little success with his mind-blowingly expensive legal cases in the UK that made him look petulant. Meghan, meanwhile, was unceremoniously shushed along at a red carpet event, like some B list celebrity, while on another crimson carpet, a former colleague from Suits, when asked about the duchess, replied in an imperious tone and with great comic timing: \"We don't have her number.\" The implication was that Hollywood had no desire to speak to her.\n\nYou'd feel sorry for the couple if they responded to their misfortune with some degree of humility. But the past few months have seen several fresh rebrands, all of them imbued with the grandiosity that we've come to associate with the couple. A new Sussex.com website was launched. It was massively regal in style and elevated their achievements to delusional heights. Then Meghan launched her new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard, with soft-focus sepia shots of her in a ballgown swanning around her Montecito mansion. In her early days in the monarchy, she was informed that she and Harry could rival the Obamas in their branding ambitions, and it seems like she still believes it.\n\nThis week Harry will visit the UK for the tenth anniversary of the Invictus games, although Meghan will not be joining him. Invictus is where Harry needs to concentrate his energy. It's as down-to-earth and substantial as the majority of the Sussex activity has been pie-in-the-sky and vacuous. The Nigeria trip, with Meghan in tow, is also supposed to focus on Nigeria. So, hurrah for that.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the royal family have weathered the Sussex fiascos with admirable silence and a great deal of dignity. There's no better branding than having your face on a stamp.", "source": {"uri": "thespectator.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spectator World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I thought this weekend would be an exclusive preview of Prince William's hissy fit over Harry's Wednesday visit to the UK, but no. Instead, Nikkhah got an exclusive from Buckingham Palace, all about King Charles and how he's driving everyone crazy because he wants to get back to work, despite the fact that he's still being treated for cancer. The Times reports that Charles has been writing a lot of letters and thinking a lot about the legacy of his reign and whether he'll be remembered as a \"caretaker king.\" I would say that his legacy will be remembered differently depending on the length of his reign, you know? It hasn't even been two full years since QEII died (and everything fell apart soon after). Some highlights from the Times:\n\nThe king's frustrations: \"He has been frustrated, because there is still so much he wants to achieve,\" says a source close to Charles of his three-month hiatus from public duties since his diagnosis. \"He holds himself to very high standards of public service and genuinely feels he's letting people and organisations down if he's not out there doing all those public bits of his formal role.\" A friend puts it more bluntly: \"He's a bloody caged lion, driving everyone round the twist if he's stuck at home.\"\n\nThe king's schedule for the next two months, including D-Day: The royal calendar between now and the monarch's summer holiday in Scotland looks packed, and there are set-piece moments that Charles is determined to attend, health permitting. Top of that list is his hope to travel to Normandy on June 6 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings, with the Prince of Wales also expected to join his father in France that day to honour the fallen.\n\nWilliam is worried about his father: Prince William is understood to fret about his \"workaholic\" father's pace. A source close to the prince says: \"He wants to make sure his father is balancing his recovery. He knows his dad loves work, but he does worry about him.\"\n\nA royal soap opera: A friend of the King and Queen says: \"This has been the year that nobody could have predicted in any way. Just when you think royal life gets predictable, they both have a crown on their heads, the family is settling into a rhythm, the second son is not letting off too many bombs -- and then suddenly an absolute explosion happens to throw up all of your plans. That family just has more drama than an episode of EastEnders.\"\n\nThe Caretaker King: Courtiers loudly harrumphed at the idea, biographers dedicated pages to rebutting the suggestion, but his shock cancer diagnosis did not help the image of a king stopped in his tracks. A friend says: \"Monarchs are caretakers, they take care of the role of sovereign and the nation. The continuity of his interests from Prince of Wales to King can sometimes be interpreted as him not changing anything, but the change is hiding in plain sight. He has pursued things skilfully from his last role as heir, to King. Look at his speech at Cop28, delivered to presidents and prime ministers [in Dubai in December] -- he is recognised as a world leader in that field. Look at the Coronation Food Project he launched on his 75th birthday. He is not just a figurehead. He is driving solutions to the issues that are facing society today, he is there pushing the fight for change, and with no disrespect to the late Queen, he is doing it in a way that she didn't.\"\n\nHis schedule: Charles's summer schedule begins on Wednesday when he is due to attend the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season. He may also meet with Prince Harry the same day, who will be in London for a service at St Paul's Cathedral marking the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games. On May 20, Charles plans to be at the opening of the Chelsea Flower Show, where he is keen to visit the King's Foundation show garden. On June 7 -- the day after the D-Day trip to France -- he hopes to be at the wedding of his godson, the Duke of Westminster, who will be married at Chester Cathedral in what will be the society wedding of the year.\n\nTrooping, Garter, Ascot: On June 15, he is determined to be at Trooping the Colour, though aides say reports that he may ride on the parade \"would be on the ambitious scale of what is possible\", with contingency plans for him to travel from the palace to Horse Guards Parade in a carriage. On June 17, he wants to lead the annual traditional procession of royal knights and ladies of the Order of the Garter at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, and on June 18, five days of racing gets under way at Royal Ascot. The King has taken on more than 200 royal patronages, including the Jockey Club with the Queen, and sources close to the King, who attended Ascot every day last year with the Queen, say he is equally keen on a \"large-scale attendance\" next month. Late June will see the pomp and ceremony of the Japanese state visit, and the first week of July will take Charles to Holyrood Week, the monarch's traditional annual trip to Scotland for a series of engagements.\n\n[From The Times]\n\nThey're positioning Charles as weakened-but-capable and hellbent on squeezing the last drop of power out of his position. This seems less like a rebuttal to vague republican critics and more like official pushback on Kensington Palace and William. This is Charles telling his son to settle down and stop worrying about \"taking over\" just yet. The summer schedule is interesting and Nikkhah actually broke some news there - Charles wants to fly to Normandy and he's telling Huevo to get his ass in gear and travel there as well. Charles also plans to attend many days of Ascot and the opening of the Chelsea Flower Show, the site of Princess Kate's thunder-stealing last year. As for William's \"concerns\" about his father's schedule... Charles wouldn't have to do all of this while he has cancer if William was actually capable of stepping up and acting as Charles did when Charles was the heir.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com",

Exactly one year ago, the Royal Family gathered for one of its most historic days in decades - the Coronation of King Charles.\n\nThe joyous event saw the entire family turn out to witness Charles finally being crowned alongside Queen Camilla in a grand ceremony at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales also shone in their coronation attire while their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis charmed the crowds during the unforgettable Buckingham Palace balcony appearance.\n\nThe day seemed to herald the start of a fresh era of modern monarchy filled with hope for the future. Plans were set in motion for Royal tours and other thrilling events as many of the senior royals eased into their new roles, reports the Mirror.\n\nHowever, 12 months on from that jubilant day, things look very different for the Firm and it's not been a smooth year for many of its key members....\n\nCharles' health struggles\n\nFollowing his coronation, the King immersed himself in his work in the only way he knew how - by maintaining a busy schedule. In addition to attending staples of the Royal calendar such as Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot and Remembrance Sunday, he and Queen Camilla embarked on state visits to both France and Kenya.\n\nLast Christmas, the royals gathered as usual at Sandringham for their traditional celebration, and following the festive period, it was anticipated that he would resume his regular Royal engagements. However, on January 17, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with an enlarged prostate and would undergo a hospital procedure to address it.\n\nAfter the procedure at the London Clinic, Buckingham Palace disclosed on February 5 that the King had been diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer and would commence treatment.\n\nWhile his public duties were put on hold, he continued with private responsibilities within the palace. His nephew, Peter Phillips, spoke to Sky News Australia about the King's condition, saying: \"He's frustrated that he can't get on and do everything that he wants to be able to do. But he is very pragmatic, he understands that there's a period of time that he really needs to focus on himself.\"\n\nPhillips added: \"But at the same time, he is always pushing, his staff and everybody and his doctors and nurses to be able to say, 'Actually, can I do this? Can I do that? ' So the overriding message would be that he's obviously very keen to get back to a form of normality. And he's probably frustrated that, recovery is taking a little longer than probably he would want it to.\"\n\nYet, mere days following those statements, he caught the eye of Royal enthusiasts by partaking in a spontaneous walkabout after the yearly Easter Sunday church service in Windsor - and just last week, received clearance to resume his public duties.\n\nWhilst his medical treatment is ongoing, he returned to public life last week with a visit to a cancer centre. The forthcoming summer months have a packed roster of colourful ceremonial events such as Trooping the Colour, Garter Day, and Royal Ascot for the Royal Family, with potential overseas trips towards the end of the year since Samoa will host the biennial meeting of Commonwealth leaders.\n\nAccording to a Palace spokesperson, plans regarding how the monarch and his spouse could participate in summer and autumn events continue, but \"nothing can be confirmed or guaranteed\" and all plans will depend on medical advice closer to the date.\n\nPrincess Kate's shocking diagnosis\n\nThe King wasn't the only one to confront health issues - the Princess of Wales experienced them too.\n\nFollowing the coronation, her early years project gained momentum, comprising nationwide engagements and capped off by her now traditional Christmas carol concert at Westminster Abbey. Royal followers were awaiting her comeback post-Christmas, but Kensington Palace suddenly announced on January 17 that Kate had been hospitalised for abdominal surgery.\n\nThe surgery was initially deemed a success, and it was anticipated that the princess would return to her Royal duties after Easter. However, as the holiday neared, she had to share more distressing news about her health.\n\nIn a poignant video message, she disclosed her cancer diagnosis and the commencement of preventative chemotherapy. At the time of her surgery, it was believed her condition was benign, with no tests indicating cancer.\n\nYet, subsequent post-operative tests revealed its presence.\n\nIn an emotional broadcast to the nation, Kate spoke of \"an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family\". Demonstrating remarkable courage, she offered words of encouragement to others in similar struggles: \"For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone.\"\n\nKensington Palace has confirmed: \"The Princess will return to official duties when she is cleared to do so by her medical team. She is in good spirits and is focused on making a full recovery.\"\n\nHowever, the princess's health woes aren't the only issues she's faced; earlier this year, she became the subject of unfounded and harsh conspiracy theories.\n\nDespite Kensington Palace's previous statement that she would not return until after Easter, this did not prevent heartless trolls from flooding social media with theories about her absence from public life.\n\nThe speculation intensified when it was revealed that a Mother's Day photo of Kate with her children, taken by Prince William, had been digitally altered - an adjustment that Kate herself admitted to making. In addition, it was disclosed that the London Clinic, where Kate underwent surgery, had initiated an investigation following allegations that staff attempted to access her private medical records.\n\nOn March 22, Kate announced her cancer diagnosis.\n\nHarry and Meghan's comeback?\n\nPrior to the coronation, relations between Prince Harry and his Royal relatives were at an all-time low following the publication of his contentious memoir, Spare.\n\nHowever, following the significant event, which Harry attended alone, there was a softening in the relationship between Harry and his father as 2023 drew to a close. It was reported that the Duke of Sussex called the King to wish him a happy 75th birthday on November 14.\n\nThere was no reunion over Christmas, but as soon as Charles announced his cancer news, Harry almost immediately boarded a flight to the UK to visit his father. Their meeting at Clarence House lasted approximately 45 minutes before Harry returned directly to the US.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Good Morning America, Prince Harry expressed gratitude for the time he was able to spend with his father, stating: \"Look I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nWhen questioned about the status of his father's health, however, he opted for privacy, declaring \"that stays between us\". He did hint at hopes for familial reconciliation, suggesting illness could bring families together: \"Yeah, I'm sure. Throughout all these families I see it on a day-to-day basis the strength of the family unit coming together. I think any illness, any sickness brings families together.\"\n\nWith the 10-year anniversary ceremony of the Invictus Games on the horizon, questions linger as to whether Harry's relationship with his father has improved. Interestingly, it seems Harry's relationship with his older brother, Prince William, remains fraught, as the two are not currently believed to be in communication.\n\nBut familial tensions don't stop there. King Charles has also butted heads with his younger brother, Prince Andrew.\n\nThey're thought to be battling over Andrew's living arrangements at Royal Lodge in Windsor, a dispute that, according to sources, doesn't appear to be resolving itself easily, with one remarking: \"Andrew is going nowhere. The King can't force him out. He has a cast iron lease that he has absolutely every intention of honouring.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The royal couple reportedly got there before pages like Prince George -- and there was another snag in the schedule.\n\n\"Unbeknown to them, the Prince and Princess of Wales and their two younger children are running a minute and a half late. The Waleses are supposed to be there eight minutes ahead of the King and Queen. Yet they will now arrive after them,\" Hardman writes in The Making of a King, published on Thursday.\n\n\"Although the congregation inside the abbey don't know it, there is an awkward scene unfolding outside as the King and Queen are in their coach. It is an added layer of stress that the couple really do not want or need on a day like this,\" he writes. Recapping a lipreader's translation of what King Charles said footage caught on a Sky News camera, Hardman writes that the monarch said, \" 'We can never be on time...There's always something...This is boring.' \"\n\nRelated: The Best Moments from King Charles' Coronation That We're Still Swooning Over One Year Later\n\n\"As with his irksome pen in the days after his mother's death, it's a snapshot of a man under extreme pressure in the full gaze of the world's media,\" the biographer writes in The Making of a King.\n\nThe author adds that sources have different conclusions on the root of the snafu. Some say that Prince William and Princess Kate's decision to make a coronation video added \"precious seconds\" to their schedule while staff for William and Kate speculate that because the King reached the abbey early, the Wales' car got caught behind his cavalcade when it should have been ahead.\n\nRelated: Every Photo from the Coronation of King Charles III\n\n\"It is unusual for the two most important arrivals at such a significant event, and over such a well-trodden route, to be so unpunctual. The result is some frantic rewriting of the running order,\" Hardman writes of the entrance Prince and Princess of Wales made with Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. \"There isn't time for the Waleses and their two younger children to enter ahead of the King and Queen. They must now follow behind and bring up the rear.\"\n\nThere were plenty of rehearsals for King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation ceremony, which otherwise seemed to run smoothly. Prince William's pivotal place in the line of succession was emphasized when he knelt before his father to pay homage after he was crowned on May 6. Prince George also made history as the first future monarch to officially play a role in a coronation service by acting as a Page of Honor for his grandfather.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Precisely in this regard, the Palace of Westminster wanted to ask its citizens: What did the British think of Charles III's first year as monarch?\n\nThey describe it as the \"worst debut\" in the history of the beginning of a reign. After the death of Queen Elizabeth II, her son Charles became sovereign of the United Kingdom and after an atypical ceremony at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023 with paper instead of parchment for animal welfare; The starting signal was given to one of the reigns with more sorrows than joys for one of the longest-lived monarchies of the old continent.\n\nFrom the Instagram account of the British royal family, they ask their citizens precisely about this moment that was experienced, both on the day of the coronation and this weekend, full of moments to remember.\n\n\"A year to be proud of.

The operation, unfortunately, would keep the monarch retired from public life, adding that his public engagements would be postponed \"during a brief recovery period.\"\n\nThe monarch, however, announced that he would fulfill his duties during this time. However, two weeks later, unexpected news was shared from the Palace through a statement: King Charles III had been diagnosed with cancer after prostate surgery, a disease that his daughter-in-law, Kate Middleton, is also experiencing.\n\nThe monarch's popularity is increasing, as is that of his wife, Queen Camilla, who was crowned Queen and not just consort, according to the wishes of Elizabeth II herself after years of bad press.

As you can imagine, the British media is still incredibly salty about it. They're demanding to see Meghan, they're crying about how the trip is \"quasi-royal,\" they're trying to instigate drama in Nigeria, they're acting like Britain \"owns\" the Sussexes AND Nigeria. It's all been a huge mess and it would not surprise me at all if this international tantrum has larger repercussions for Britain's diplomatic and economic relationship with Nigeria. Speaking of, y'all know that the British government/media/palace has tried to impose themselves on the Nigerian government about the Sussexes' visit. Please - the palace begged the Biden team to not allow the Sussexes on Air Force One. Of course the palace has tried to throw their weight around this Nigerian visit. But at the end of the day, the British envoy to Nigeria had to admit that he's not part of the planning of this visit:\n\nBritish envoy to Nigeria, Dr Richard Montgomery has disclosed the British High Commission is not involved in arranging or facilitating the proposed visit of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry, and his wife, Meghan to Nigeria. Montgomery said this while reacting to the proposed visit of Harry and Meghan to Nigeria on the invitation of Chief of Defense Staff, Gen. Christopher Musa.\n\nMontgomery who spoke in an interview with NAN added that Harry and Meghan will be visiting Nigeria in their private capacity. He added that they will also not be representing the work of the British government during the visit.\n\n\"It's great that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are visiting Nigeria, which I understand is at the invitation of Defence Headquarters. But they are visiting in a private capacity, not an official one. So, the British High Commission is not involved in arranging or facilitating their programme. They are not representing the work of His Majesty's Government on this visit.\"\n\nPrince Harry are expected to kick off the journey on May 8, by attending the 10th anniversary celebration of the Invictus Games at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Shortly after, Meghan will join him in Nigeria for a series of engagements aimed at fostering cultural exchange and celebrating the spirit of resilience among service members. The couple's itinerary includes visits to military rehabilitation centers, sports facilities, and meetings with local organizations working to support veterans' welfare. They will also attend cultural events and engage in discussions with community leaders on topics.\n\n[From PM News Nigeria]\n\nCan you imagine if the Sussexes actually had to coordinate through the British High Commission or the Foreign Office? There would be so many leaks, so much drama and the British government would do the most to put them in danger. Speaking of, the Daily Mail did a lengthy piece on what the Sussexes' tour might look like or entail, and the piece revealed how much the Daily Mail WANTS this to be a royal tour and wants the Sussexes to f-k up internationally, much like William and Kate make asses out of themselves whenever they travel. Anyway, salty people are salty, news at seven. Still, it's fascinating to me that the British media/royal apparatus operates like the world can't see how violent, how slimy, how sadistic they are.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_High_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British High Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 2014, "textEnd": 2019}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 96, "relevance": 1}

The royal couple reportedly got there before pages like Prince George -- and there was another snag in the schedule.\n\n\"Unbeknown to them, the Prince and Princess of Wales and their two younger children are running a minute and a half late. The Waleses are supposed to be there eight minutes ahead of the King and Queen. Yet they will now arrive after them,\" Hardman writes in The Making of a King, published on Thursday.\n\n\"Although the congregation inside the abbey don't know it, there is an awkward scene unfolding outside as the King and Queen are in their coach. It is an added layer of stress that the couple really do not want or need on a day like this,\" he writes. Recapping a lipreader's translation of what King Charles said footage caught on a Sky News camera, Hardman writes that the monarch said, \" 'We can never be on time...There's always something...This is boring.' \"\n\n\"As with his irksome pen in the days after his mother's death, it's a snapshot of a man under extreme pressure in the full gaze of the world's media,\" the biographer writes in The Making of a King.\n\nThe author adds that sources have different conclusions on the root of the snafu. Some say that Prince William and Princess Kate's decision to make a coronation video added \"precious seconds\" to their schedule while staff for William and Kate speculate that because the King reached the abbey early, the Wales' car got caught behind his cavalcade when it should have been ahead.\n\n\"It is unusual for the two most important arrivals at such a significant event, and over such a well-trodden route, to be so unpunctual. The result is some frantic rewriting of the running order,\" Hardman writes of the entrance Prince and Princess of Wales made with Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. \"There isn't time for the Waleses and their two younger children to enter ahead of the King and Queen. They must now follow behind and bring up the rear.\"\n\nThere were plenty of rehearsals for King Charles and Queen Camilla's coronation ceremony, which otherwise seemed to run smoothly. Prince William's pivotal place in the line of succession was emphasized when he knelt before his father to pay homage after he was crowned on May 6. Prince George also made history as the first future monarch to officially play a role in a coronation service by acting as a Page of Honor for his grandfather.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

It's also been a challenging 12 months for the royal family, but royal author Robert Hardman is looking back on that big day through a fresh lens in his new book, The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy.\n\nMay 6, 2023, was a day that was supposed to go off without a hitch -- rehearsals had taken place and the timing for everyone's arrival was set to a specific minute. The royal family had to be in place before King Charles made his grand entrance -- except things didn't go as planned that day. Prince William and Kate Middleton were running late and threw the entire schedule off on live TV as millions watched the uncomfortable scene unfold.\n\n\"Unbeknown to them, the Prince and Princess of Wales and their two younger children are running a minute and a half late. The Waleses are supposed to be there eight minutes ahead of the King and Queen. Yet they will now arrive after them,\" Hardman wrote in his book, via People. While guests inside the venue had no clue that there was an issue, the TV cameras captured \"the awkward scene\" for viewers at home. \"It is an added layer of stress that the couple really do not want or need on a day like this,\" the author wrote. It didn't help that internet lip readers claimed that Sky News captured the king saying, \"We can never be on time...There's always something...This is boring,\" per Hardman's book.\n\nBesides trying to corral their two young children, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5, William and Kate's social media coronation video may have been to blame. According to Hardman's sources, the decision to film their preparations ahead of Charles' coronation added \"precious seconds\" to the schedule, and then all hell broke loose. \"It is unusual for the two most important arrivals at such a significant event, and over such a well-trodden route, to be so unpunctual. The result is some frantic rewriting of the running order,\" he added. In the end, there was no time for the Waleses and their two younger children to enter ahead of the King and Queen\" and they wound up entering into the abbey last.\n\nKate and William were criticized for their cinematic video of the coronation because it was \"[Charles] and Queen Camilla's moment.\" The Daily Mail described the clip as a \"look-at-me\" moment that she compared to the \"Netflix-style narcissism\" of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Even though the Waleses were likely giving hints of a new monarchy once their reign began, it sounds like King Charles didn't appreciate them stepping on his toes for a position he waited a lifetime for.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristyn_burtt@sheknows.com", "name": "Kristyn Burtt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcissism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kate-middleton-prince-william.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 93, "relevance": 1}

Health issues have faced the King himself, after his cancer diagnosis was announced in January,. as the royals also face Kate Middleton's own cancer battle.\n\nWith tensions between the King, the rest of 'the Firm' and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle not appearing to have thawed out of late, and with Harry set to arrive in the UK tomorrow (May 8) for an Invictus Games event, the drama is ongoing.\n\nBut one drama the King didn't haver to deal with concerned the official investiture ceremony for the Prince and Princess of Wales' titles to be officially introduced. As we reported last year, Prince William and Kate Middleton were allegedly \"denied\" the Royal Family benefit in their new roles in order to save some money.\n\nAccording to a royal commentator, the couple didn't have an official investiture ceremony where they received their Prince and Princess of Wales, the Mirror reports.\n\nThe tradition was apparently \"unceremoniously done away with\" and the royal analyst claimed it was all down to one reason.\n\nKing Charles was crowned the Prince of Wales in 1969 at an official ceremony at Caernarfon Castle but Kensington Palace previously announced that another investiture was \"not on the table\".\n\nRoyal commentator Daniela Elser stated that the \"most obvious\" reason to not have a crowning for William and Kate is simply due to how expensive it would be.\n\nShe said this means the royal couple would not receive \"one of the biggest perks of their new positions\" after William was honoured with the title following the death of Queen Elizabeth in September 2022.\n\nThe Royal Family faced public criticism over the eye watering cost of the King's Coronation last May after the historical event cost an estimated \u00a3250m during the cost of living crisis.\n\nWilliam is said to be preparing a very different Coronation to his father when his time comes to succeed the throne after Charles' ceremony received backlash.\n\nWriting for news.com.au, Ms Elser added: \"It's easy to understand why the Waleses might have no interest in going down the investiture route and it has nothing to do with the prospect of spending time in Cardiff or learning to love a pastie.\n\n\"The point is here, investitures are not something one can do on the cheap, therefore, if William and Kate did decide they wanted their own, it would require someone spending tens of millions of dollars on something that would be nothing but a blatant marketing ploy.\"\n\nShe went on: \"Not only will William not get the chance to do some King-in-waiting play-acting for TV cameras at his own Wales investiture but it means that his wife Kate, the Princess of Wales has been denied the chance to get Alexander McQueen to design her up another Athena-esque, goddess-like get-up.\"\n\nMark Drakeford, the Welsh First Minister, said that after the death of Her Majesty there were some \"sensitivities\" surrounding the title as he added that there is \"no rush\" for an investiture.\n\nHe said: \"The Wales of 2022 is not the Wales of 1969. I don't think it would be sensible to look back and say you could simply replicate that.\n\n\"My only advice, if it was ever sought, would be to give these things time. There is no rush.\n\n\"I think that there are plenty of things for someone wanting to come to Wales more often, spending more time here, learning more about the things that matter in contemporary Wales - plenty for that role to be able to develop and no need to feel that ceremonial occasions need to be early on the agenda.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The podcast, based on and named after Camilla's online book club The Queen's Reading Room, has become a massive success in the ratings.\n\nIt is so popular that another event is set to be recorded soon at a \"star-studded\" Hampton Court Palace, which is in stark contrast to Meghan Markle's Archetypes that was axed by Spotify last year.\n\nMedia reports circulated at the time that Spotify was unhappy with her lack of output and engagement for the \u00a315 million deal, which only saw 12 episodes released. She was booted when she was down when Spotify's senior podcasting executive Bill Simmons tore into the royal couple on his own podcast, calling them \"f***ing grifters\".\n\n\"Given Meghan's apparent disinterest in Queen Camilla, I doubt if she has a nice word to say about her or her podcast,\" royal author Ingrid Seward dished via Ok! Magazine.\n\n\"Camilla's podcast has been a great success,\" she added. \"She has proven many times over she can bring in any of the big names from the world of the arts she wants. \"\n\nThe upcoming 'Queen's Reading Room Festival' is set to take place on June 8, and is only returning due to \"popular demand.\" According to a press statement about the event, it will feature: \"Harry Potter [stars] Miriam Margolyes and Helena Bonham Carter, thrill-writer Harlan Coben, and a special musical showcase of the musical comedy Operation Mincemeat.\"\n\nLiteracy is \"Her Majesty's signature initiative,\" according to a royal insider, who also pointed out that the Queen \"enjoys promoting childhood literacy, in particular.\"\n\nQueen Camilla's reputation was thrown into the spotlight in early 2023 when Prince Harry's memoir, Spare, revealed numerous \"incendiary\" passages about her, calling his stepmother \"dangerous\" and claiming she enjoyed using others to deflect negative press from herself.\n\nThis led one brand expert to label the podcast as the Queen's \"perfect revenge\".\n\n\"After all the hurtful things Harry has said about Camilla, she has finally got her own back on them,\" director of Borne Media, Denise Palmer Davies told an outlet. \"I bet Meghan, in particular, will be livid over the whole thing, and probably a bit embarrassed that hers fell at the first hurdle.\"\n\nSeward added that she doesn't think Camilla has the time or inclination to feel anything much about Meghan:\n\n\"She is confident and comfortable in herself and would see no necessity to give Meghan or what she is doing or saying a second thought. She is far too polite to say anything. Should she come across Meghan soon she will be detached but as charming as always.\"\n\nReports have repeatedly suggested that Prince Harry and Meghan are flailing on the other side of the pond, with Meghan resorting to selling jams while moving her audio venture over to another publisher.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Meghan said \"I'm proud to now be able to share that I am joining the brilliant team at Lemonada to continue my love of podcasting. Being able to support a female-founded company with a roster of thought-provoking and highly entertaining podcasts is a fantastic way to kick off 2024.\n\nAs OK! reported, the upcoming series has reportedly been \"pushed back\", with some claiming a lack of \"A-listers,\" for the Duchess to interview as the possible reason.", "source": {"uri": "2oceansvibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "2oceansvibe News | South African and international news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Eugenie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Eugenie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hampton Court Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Mincemeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Margolyes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miriam Margolyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Coben", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlan Coben"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helena Bonham Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.2oceansvibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Queen-Camilla-podcast-151223-HMQ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 1509, "textEnd": 1515}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 89, "relevance": 1}

It felt equal parts otherworldly -- the ancient regalia, the anointing so sacred it happened behind a screen -- and oddly relatable, as when a lip reader claimed to catch King Charles venting to Camilla about how \"we can never be on time!\" when his carriage was forced to wait for Will and Kate, running late, to catch up.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt also rained buckets that day, which in hindsight could be interpreted as an omen for the royal year that followed. (Or, you know, just England England-ing.) Either way, it's been a wild 12 months for the Royal Family since King Charles's coronation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA few of the biggest moments from this first roller coaster year of Charles III's reign ....\n\n1. The King is diagnosed with cancer\n\nForget royal tours, walkabouts or charity engagements: If there is one defining event from Charles's first year on the throne, it will be the news of his cancer diagnosis just eight months after his coronation.\n\nLike Charles himself told people at an event last week, it was a \"bit of a shock\" to hear the 75-year-old monarch was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer, discovered during a routine prostate operation. He quickly began receiving treatment, which is still ongoing, although his doctors recently cleared him for a return to public-facing duties.\n\nIt may also turn out to be a key part of his legacy. The level of relative openness that the King has displayed throughout this sadly-all-too-common experience seems to have created a connection with his subjects the famously cerebral monarch might have struggled to achieve otherwise. Even before the cancer news, the fact that the King shared he was having something done on his prostate led to a spike in searches around a topic that can be taboo.\n\n2. After weeks of frenzied speculation, Kate Middleton shares she is being treated for cancer as well\n\nIt feels like a fever dream now, but just a few weeks ago it seemed like the entire world had fallen down a \"Where is Kate?\"-shaped conspiracy-theory black hole. The only thing that put a stop to the lurid imaginings pulled from the darkest corners of the internet was a video announcement from the Princess of Wales herself, explaining that her months-long absence from public life was, well, exactly what she'd told us it was: recovery from an intense abdominal surgery that she had in January, but complicated by news that almost nobody saw coming. Like the King, she too was being treated for cancer and would be out for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's a very sad plot twist that, when you look back at the images of a smiling Kate in her robes and an Alexander McQueen headpiece at the coronation, feels all the more unbelievable, particularly when so much of the chatter at the time was around her status as a \"secret weapon\" and key support for the older King.\n\n3. Kate is censured by news agencies for photo \"manipulation\"\n\nScratch that: The thing nobody had on their bingo card for Year 1 of Charles's reign was the Royal Family losing its status as a \"trusted source\" by several news photo agencies. The reason? An image shared with them by Kensington Palace, purporting to be a recent photograph of Kate and her three children taken by Prince William. It was released at the height of the \"Where Is Kate?\" fever, and seemed intended to quiet the fervid speculation. It had the opposite effect, however, courtesy of several high-profile news organizations pulling the image over concerns that it had been manipulated in a way that violated their strict \"no editing\" policies. Also: Within a few days -- but not before everyone on Twitter was suddenly a forensic Photoshop expert, it seems -- Kate released a short social media statement where she apologized for \"confusion\" that the photo caused, adding that \"like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.\"\n\n4. Queen Camilla and Prince William become the faces of the Royal Family\n\nWith two of its biggest stars out of commission, it fell to Camilla and Prince William to shoulder the public-facing responsibilities in a family business whose entire raison d'\u00eatre is to be seen. The results have been fascinating.\n\nCamilla, for instance, came into this reign with the shadow of Diana (and all that might have been in an alternate universe) looming over her. Always a lower key royal, likely by design, she's found herself as one of only two senior royals on the meet-n-greet front lines, gamely fielding inquiries about the King's health with a \"He's doing very well\" when asked by curious punters. In quietly keeping the lights on, she seems to have quelled much of the \"Camilla is not MY queen\" brigade that were very vocal when the palace dropped the \"consort\" modifier from her title before the coronation.\n\nWilliam, by contrast, has had a much tougher run in the public eye. In fact, at the peak of the Kate speculation, he became the internet's favourite villain, dogged by unfounded accusations that at their most benign (really!) dredged up long-debunked claims of infidelity. Wild aspersions aside, he's also been criticized for the lightness of his workload -- just a handful since the start of the year -- although that flack has gotten a bit quieter since news about Kate's cancer treatment broke.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW 5. Prince Harry's had a mixed bag of legal wins and security setbacks\n\nSidelined at the coronation -- a day that also happened to be his son's birthday -- Prince Harry has continued to operate on the periphery of his father's reign, generally to The Firm's detriment.\n\nThere was the much-publicized dash he made to England shortly after his father's cancer diagnosis, a meeting that lasted just half an hour -- and whatever the truth behind the brevity, transpired to make Charles look like an unfeeling parent who couldn't even spare an hour for the son he hadn't seen in months.\n\nThere have also been Harry's ongoing legal battles, both of which tend not to paint the royal operation in a positive light. On one front, he's suing several tabloids for illegal information gathering -- and has even won a few payouts -- and in the course of that testimony, brought to light, say, the fact that Prince William quietly took a \"very large\" settlement from Rupert Murdoch's newspapers in order to resolve his own phone-hacking claim out of the public arena.\n\nHarry is also continuing to battle the British government over his security protection, which was revoked when he quit his role as a working royal back in 2020. It underscores the ongoing rift between the Duke of Sussex and his family -- and inevitably, if somewhat unfairly, paints them as the people who hung him and his family out to dry when he tried to leave the family business.\n\nAs for what the future might hold for the second year of Charles III's reign?

As the duke, I'm assuming, was busily doing the maths on how fast he could get his hands on a pint of bitter and a gross of Valium, the newly enthroned King passed him by at which point did something decidedly un-regal. He winked at him.\n\n\"Eddie, well done and thank you,\" Charles said, according to 'Eddie' aka the duke himself.\n\nBut that's not the only moment of high-emotion on coronation day that somehow got largely missed on a day when we all overdosed on pomp, ceremony and awe at Penny Mordaunt's biceps as she bore the 17th-century silver-gilt sword of state aloft for nearly an hour.\n\nWhile it was largely overlooked at the time, what with history being made via live stream and Queen Camilla looking suspiciously like she had had a bracing belter with the Marchioness of Lansdowne when no one was looking, Prince William and Kate, the Prince and Princess of Wales came very close to truly buggering up the day.\n\nOne possible reason for this snafu? William and Kate wanted to do some Instagramming.\n\nMonday marked a full 12-months since the King's big day, a moment that he had been preparing for since he was in short pants and Britain was still busy tooting the horn for empire and powdered eggs.\n\nThus, on Monday, Crown Inc celebrated by putting out a couple of social media videos and the Waleses celebrated the day by doing precisely nothing, suggesting either the retweet button has stopped working on William's keyboard or he totally forgot. (What's the customary gift for a King on their first coronation anniversary? A territorially disputed North Sea island?)\n\nThings, however, were far less perfect behind-the-scenes on the actual day. While much of it went off sans hitches and without any of the horses doing a bolt for the greener pastures of St James's Park, as the clock ticked down towards the 11am start time, a major stuff up was unfolding.\n\nSomehow, every single one of the 2000 of people packed inside Westminster Abbey looking like slightly bored sardines (many who had been seated for nearly four hours by the time the service started) managed to process down the aisle before Charles and Camilla did - except for William, Kate and their children.\n\nDistinguished, longtime royal biographer Robert Hardman explains in his roman-a-Rex, Charles III: The Inside Story, how this came about.\n\nAccording to Hardman, things started to veer off schedule on the coronation day when the King's Procession, the horsey, big Household Cavalry convoy that escorted the Golden State Coach to the Abbey, proved too efficient. In short, they went too fast, thus getting Their Majesties to the church early.\n\n(They even, in fact, arrived before their eight pages who were still probably being divested of their Nintendo Switches.)\n\nAs Hardman writes: \"Although the congregation inside the abbey don't know it, there is an awkward scene unfolding outside as the King and Queen remain in their coach. It is an added layer of stress that the couple really do not want or need on a day like this.\"\n\nSky News had had the foresight to hire a lip reader for their coverage, who caught what Charles was saying while he twiddled his famously sausagey thumbs outside in the State Carriage. It was wonderfully un-King-like. \"We can never be on time,\" he grumbled. \"This is a negative. There's always something ... This is boring.\"\n\n(I, personally, love the image of a septuagenarian about to give himself over to a positively ancient ritual whose roots date back to the Old Testament sitting outside and kvetching about being 'bored' like a petulant preschooler who wants their iPad back.)\n\nMeanwhile, over at Kensington Palace, the London residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, things that morning had been moving in the opposite direction with the family running about a minute and a half late. The Waleses had been due to arrive eight minutes ahead of the King and Queen and instead ended up arriving ... after them.\n\nPause for us all to adopt an Edvard Munch The Scream-style pose of horror.\n\nAny who, while His Majesty fussed and Her Majesty, I'm assuming, urged her husband to try some alternate nostril breathing to keep calm and Carolean-on in the Golden State Coach, royal staffers were adopting panic stations.\n\n\"It is unusual for the two most important arrivals at such a significant event, and over such a well-trodden route, to be so unpunctual,\" Hardman writes of the scene in Charles III. \"The result is some frantic rewriting of the running order. There isn't time for the Waleses and their two younger children to enter ahead of the King and Queen. They must now follow behind and bring up the rear.\"\n\nSo what had triggered the \"awkward scene\" outside the abbey and ended up causing the King this stress? How did William and Kate come so perilously close to buggering up Charles' day?\n\nInstagram. And X.\n\nOver the course of the coronation weekend, the couple released a series of glossy, high-sheen content via their social media channels. Per Hardman: \"Conflicting sources will suggest that the Waleses' decision to make a Coronation Day video has added precious seconds to their schedule and made them late.\"\n\nAs of now, these high-def, largely self-serving and self-promoting, clips have accumulated nearly 110 million views on Instagram and X alone.\n\nLooking at that moment - The King arriving early and irked, William and Kate running behind as they were filmed for posterity and in the eternal quest for likes - is highly illuminating. The Prince and Princess of Wales would seem to have gone into the day with a keen eye on how their participation would play out to a global, social audience and they put their brand first, at the expense of Charles.\n\nThere is another major point that needs to be double underlined here - Imagine if this had been Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, if they had gotten to the abbey behind schedule because they were busy making 'grammable morsels. Certain segments of the British press would have been so incensed and outraged by such a Sussex display that they would have been calling for their deportation on the first flight to a non-Commonwealth jurisdiction.\n\nThe upside, at least, is that it gave Charles something in common with his dear departed \"Mummy\". In 1937, the then 11-year-old Princess Elizabeth watched on as her father was crowned George VI, later writing in her journal, \"the service got rather boring.\"\n\nI look forward to Prince George's confessional video beamed into our cerebral cortexes via whatever neural link Amazon will end up selling in which he complains about being bored at King William's coronation one day ...", "source":

Sounds like Prince William and Princess Catherine almost ruined King Charles III's coronation!\n\nIn his new book The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy, royal biographer Robert Hardman reflects on the monarch's coronation one year after the fact -- and revealed there was a massive snafu behind the scenes!\n\nAccording to the author, Charles and Queen Camilla arrived for the crowning at Westminster Abbey before their heirs -- causing a ton of last-minute logistical issues! Hardman wrote:\n\n\"Unbeknown to them, the Prince and Princess of Wales and their two younger children are running a minute and a half late. The Waleses are supposed to be there eight minutes ahead of the King and Queen. Yet they will now arrive after them.\"\n\nA minute and a half might not seem like a big problem, but for an event as planned out and choreographed as this, it was a HUGE issue!\n\nRelated: Kate & William 'Going Through Hell' Behind Closed Doors\n\nThe writer continued:\n\n\"Although the congregation inside the abbey don't know it, there is an awkward scene unfolding outside as the King and Queen are in their coach. It is an added layer of stress that the couple really do not want or need on a day like this.\"\n\nAs you may recall, His Majesty was actually caught on camera by Sky News looking super upset at the time. According to a lipreader's translation via the author, the 75-year-old complained:\n\n\"'We can never be on time...There's always something...This is boring.'\"\n\nThe journalist compared this grumpy AF behavior to Charles' pen tantrum, pointing out:\n\n\"As with his irksome pen in the days after his mother's death, it's a snapshot of a man under extreme pressure in the full gaze of the world's media.\"\n\nHah! He was definitely quick to get frustrated at the time! But it's worth noting he was also dealing with his sons' rift being at the center of the headlines again and mourning Queen Elizabeth II, so it's no wonder he was stressed!\n\nAs for why things got so mixed up in the first place, sources aren't totally sure. Some told the writer William and Kate's decision to make a video recapping the coronation added \"precious seconds\" to their already busy schedule, but different insiders felt that it was actually Charles and Camilla themselves who threw off the plans! Because the royals arrived at the abbey early, the Wales' car supposedly got stuck behind their procession, making it impossible to beat them to the festivities. Still, it's wild to think this clumsiness on such an important day.\n\nRecalling Will and Kate's entrance with Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis (Prince George walked in separately as a Page of Honor just ahead of them), Robert mused:\n\n\"It is unusual for the two most important arrivals at such a significant event, and over such a well-trodden route, to be so unpunctual. The result is some frantic rewriting of the running order. There isn't time for the Waleses and their two younger children to enter ahead of the King and Queen. They must now follow behind and bring up the rear.\"\n\nCertainly not the worst thing that could've happened! And with all the drama surrounding Prince Harry's attendance, any logical issues went over the average fan's head! But it does add some clarity to why Charles was so irritated!\n\nSee how all this played out on TV (below):\n\nIt does seem funny the Wales family came in after Charles and Camilla now that we watch it back! But at least they made it in time! Thoughts? Sound OFF (below)!\n\n[Image via MEGA/WENN]", "source": {"uri": "perezhilton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perez Hilton"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation of the British monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abbey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(1796\u20131817)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796\u20131817)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George,_Duke_of_Kent", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince George, Duke of Kent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/prince-william-kate-middleton-late-charles-coronation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 77, "relevance": 1}

Casually elegant, Meghan's presence didn't go unnoticed as a fan captured the moment and promptly posted it on Instagram.\n\nMeghan's decision to skip joining Harry on his UK trip is said to be casting a shadow over his impending journey.\n\nAt the Greycroft event, growth investor Brian Bustamante-Nicholson addressed the crowd, highlighting that each attendee was handpicked because \"we want to work with you as investors and entrepreneurs, and we can't wait to build with you all.\"", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_chessum@express.co.uk", "name": "Victoria Chessum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@express.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greycroft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greycroft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramar_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miramar Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miramar Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/1200x630/5356138.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542574", "eventUri": "eng-9542574", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 65, "relevance": 1}

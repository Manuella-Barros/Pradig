{"id": 243230112, "title": "True to word, Carlos Correa back in Twins&#8217; lineup after hit-by-pitch scare", "text": "SEATTLE \u2014 In the minutes after the game ended on Thursday, not long after he had been hit by a pitch on the right arm by Diamondbacks reliever Bryce Jarvis and walked off the field in pain, Carlos Correa was already talking about playing the next day. It seemed improbable, at least from the outside looking in. After he was hit, he immediately raised his right arm, holding it up with his left arm and walking straight to the dugout rather than taking his base. His hand, at that point, was numb and his reaction suggested he might have suffered some kind of fracture. But the Twins avoided the worst, getting an X-ray done before the end of the game, which was negative for a fracture. \u201cWe got lucky and it was a legitimately scary time for us but reasonably quickly, he knew that he was OK,\u201d manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cThe player normally does know before anyone else if he\u2019s really OK or if there\u2019s a question mark about an injury like that.\u201d And to his word, Correa was in the Twins\u2019 starting lineup on Friday, hitting second against the Seattle Mariners. \u201cIt was a little scary situation, but I\u2019m glad that I woke up feeling great and we\u2019re back in the lineup,\u201d Correa said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d Feeling great? Really? \u201cIt\u2019s going to be sore,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine.\u201d And that\u2019s a good thing for the Twins, because their star shortstop has been a key piece in making the offense go, especially of late. Correa\u2019s June saw him win an American League Player of the Week honor and entering Friday\u2019s game, he was hitting .309 with a .380 on-base percentage and .873 OPS. His 148 OPS+ is a mark that is both 48 percent better than the league average hitter and well above his own career mark of 126. \u201cHe\u2019s been exceptional. He\u2019s hammering balls on a regular basis,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cWhen you see him going the way he\u2019s going, the team goes well. We score runs. When he starts going, too, other guys start feeding off of some of it.\u201d Willi Castro makes all-star case Last week, Correa was touting Willi Castro as the team\u2019s Most Valuable Player. This week, Baldelli was talking up the utilityman\u2019s all-star credentials. Castro, who has played in every Twins\u2019 game this season, moves around the field adeptly and he\u2019s having perhaps his most productive season offensively, entering Friday\u2019s contest hitting .277 with an .820 OPS. His 2.9 fWAR (Wins Above Replacement per FanGraphs) leads the team. \u201cI think he\u2019s firmly in that conversation,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much more clear it can be that he\u2019s having an all-star season. He\u2019s done a fantastic job.\u201d No Twins player advanced to the second round of All-Star Game fan voting, which is used to determine the starting position players. The reserves and pitchers will be selected by a combination of the Commissioner\u2019s Office and player ballot, and will be revealed on July 7. Nobody from the Commissioner\u2019s Office consults Baldelli, he said, but he\u2019s hoping to see multiple players rewarded for their efforts. \u201cWe have several players having fantastic years and I think it would be, I would say, at this point, it would be a travesty to only have one guy on the all-star team,\u201d Baldelli said. Briefly Pablo L\u00f3pez will take the mound on Saturday opposed by Bryce Miller. L\u00f3pez is coming off his most dominant start of the season, an eight-inning effort in which he gave up just two hits and struck out 14.", "summary": "Carlos Correa's reaction on Thursday suggested a more severe injury.", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2024/06/28/true-to-word-carlos-correa-back-in-twins-lineup-after-hit-by-pitch-scare/", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STP-Z-Twins-Diamondbacks-Baseball_199220090.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:47:21", "author": "Betsy Helfand", "authors": ["Betsy Helfand"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.206}

University of Otago \u2013 \u014ct\u0101kou Whakaihu Waka wants prospective university students to answer that call and, alongside Special Wellington, it has created a new marketing campaign, encouraging them to head on down. The campaign, Down for It, aims to capture the momentousness of this mission, using real footage captured on the road, in the air, over the ocean by students during their latest migration south in February. It was put together by production company Assembly and backed by classic Dunedin track \u2018Tally Ho!\u2019 by The Clean. Alongside the film, outdoor posters call students down by speaking to the range of experiences on offer at the university. Giant Otago scarves handed out at Open Day reclaim and reframe the university\u2019s scarfie culture. The new campaign is the latest in a series of big moments for the university, which recently unveiled a new tohu, M\u0101ori name and identity; celebrating both its history and future. \u201cThe education landscape is rapidly changing; young people are redefining the path to success and expect more from universities. Otago has a strong history of supporting both academic and personal growth and we wanted to really lean into that. Down for It perfectly frames our unique place in the market and geographically\u201d says Lucy Bell, Marketing Manager at University of Otago. \u201cMost universities invite young people to make their mark, change the world, and forge the path they were born to walk. But many young people don\u2019t know what they want to do yet. University is where you can find out. We wanted to reframe university to be part of the windy journey of learning, not just the ladder to achievement\u201d says Head of Strategy at Special Wellington, Bethany Omeri. \u201cAs New Zealand\u2019s only true university town, Dunedin swells with the ebb and flow of students each year, as they descend en masse. We wanted to celebrate the beginning of this big, unmissable journey, in a way only Otago could\u201d says Mark Forgan, ECD Special. Assembly Director Jonny Kofoed wanted to capture the big ball of energy a student has when they start something momentous. \u201cThe film\u2019s mixed media approach allowed us to integrate various styles and animation techniques seamlessly, guiding the viewer\u2019s eye through intentional design.\u201d Emily Swan, Managing Partner, Mindshare says: \u201cOur media selection playfully brings Down for It to life in \u2018look-down\u2019 formats, and through engaging formats including airtime in co-viewing / appointment-to-view programming such as the Olympics. We are so excited to see this campaign live.\u201d \u201cWe are so grateful to be working alongside such an iconic institution. We hope this campaign works its socks off and Otago 2025 is the biggest migration yet,\u201d says Matt Barnes, Lead Business Partner, Special Wellington.", "summary": "<p>Every year, thousands migrate down to Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s deep south - albatross, seals, great white sharks, students.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stoppress.co.nz/news/university-of-otago-encourages-students-to-heed-migration-call/\">University of Otago encourages students to heed migration call</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stoppress.co.nz\">stoppress.co.nz</a>.</p>", "url": "https://stoppress.co.nz/news/university-of-otago-encourages-students-to-heed-migration-call/", "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/soar-communications-group-ltd/images/w_702,h_459/f_auto,q_auto/v1718671093/stoppress.co.nz/Down-for-It_Static-thumbnail-copy/Down-for-It_Static-thumbnail-copy.jpeg?_i=AA", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:38:20", "author": "StopPress Team", "authors": ["StopPress Team"], "language": "en", "source_country": "nz", "sentiment": 0.506}

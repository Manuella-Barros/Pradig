A huge crowd dressed in waterproofs and umbrellas were toured around the city this afternoon to witness the result of its latest makeover. But even if the weather was grey and wet, the city\u2019s latest street art was there to brighten up the mood. A fully booked tour unveiled nine new jaw-dropping murals in separate locations designed to transform Granite City walls. As the inaugural tour got underway, The Press and Journal also went along to gauge reaction and capture the action as the new pieces were officially seen for the first time. Nuart \u2018the main reason\u2019 I came to Aberdeen Lihu Yang, from New Jersey, just arrived in Aberdeen yesterday with his wife as part of his two-week driving tour of Scotland. Speaking to The Press and Journal, Lihu said Nuart was the \u201cmain reasons\u201d for visiting the Granite City. Speaking in the shadow of new piece, Case Maclaim, on the Ibis hotel building on Shiprow, he said: \u201cThe paintings are very interesting. It\u2019s impressive how they paint them all the way up there. \u201cIt was nice to hear what the tour guide was saying, because a lot of people won\u2019t be paying much attention to the story behind it. \u201cBut, so far I really like the city of Aberdeen. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Marischal College, the Bridge of Dee so far \u2013 it\u2019s all been really cool. \u201cWe only just got here yesterday but the street art is actually one of the main reasons that we came here \u2013 it\u2019s great.\u201d \u2018It really makes Aberdeen special\u2019 Aberdonian Robert Milton, 33, braved customary Aberdeen weather to admire new pieces Bahia Shebab and CBLOXX on Loch Street. Despite the heavens opening up on him and his wife Laura, 33, on their first-ever tour, he said the show was well worth the soaking. \u201cIt\u2019s all very interesting,\u201d Robert said. \u201cThis is our first time coming to Nuart, but we think it is great, it definitely cheers the place up a bit. \u201cI like it I always notice the different things when I go around the city centre. \u201cAnother great aspect of it is that it drowns out the graffiti that you sometimes see on the streets around here. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping some of this stuff inspires more people to inspire art a bit more seriously. \u201cIt really makes the place special.\u201d Nuart fighting back against grey and boring label Susan Halfpenny, 40, moved to Aberdeen two years ago from greater Manchester along with her 46-year-old husband Greg. Also coming along to their first Nuart showing, they said the new line-up has helped dispel the grey and boring label. Speaking outside Wapping Street\u2019s Niels Shoe Meulman display, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the city is grey and boring at all. \u201cI think putting all this art is really good but I think they need to shout about this type of thing more. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed hearing a bit more about the artists today and hopefully we can catch some more shows. \u201cThere were a lot more people than I thought there would be. so that\u2019s good.\u201d", "summary": "Locals and tourists alike were dazzled by the latest Granite City street art.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen-aberdeenshire/6496425/aberdeen-reacts-nuart-2024/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/KFX-080624-02-1_58273140-t8stn3gy-scaled-e1717858430436.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:30:12", "author": "Graham Fleming", "authors": ["Graham Fleming"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.322}

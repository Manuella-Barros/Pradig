Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Maitama Tuggar, stated this in a statement issued on Sunday by his Special Assistant on Media and Communications Strategy, Alkasim Abdulkadir, even as he called for immediate global action to de-escalate the spate of extreme violence against non-combatants in the Israel-Palestine conflict. He said, \u201cThe Biden Ceasefire proposal should be embraced by world leaders and the totality of the international community\u2014 to intensify efforts towards a speedy resolution of the conflict, and the immediate cessation of the attendant extreme violence in Gaza and all other innocent civilians affected by the conflict. \u201cEqually important is the continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of lifesaving humanitarian supplies and services for civilians. \u201cNigeria assures the United States of its support to bring about a complete cessation of violence and an end to the senseless loss of human lives and man-made humanitarian crises. \u201cWe are concerned that the ongoing carnage is setting a bad precedent for the international system of justice and are mindful that justice is antithetical to revenge. The Biden Plan presents a clear path towards progress and the conditions required for peace.\u201d The Minister noted that President Biden\u2019s proposal includes a deal that will lead to a permanent ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, the release of hostages, and a major reconstruction plan to rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals. \u201cNigeria believes the Biden plan is the best way forward for all parties and can prevent any repetition of the tragic deaths on 8 June of more than 200 people at the Nuseirat Refugee Camp,\u201d the statement said. The Israel- Hamas war started after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 Israelis and took over 200 as hostages. Israel immediately invaded Gaza and the ensuing conflict has led to the killing of nearly 37,000 Palestinians while over 82,000 were injured according figures released by Hamas-run health Ministry in Gaza.", "summary": "The Nigerian Government has thrown its weight behind the ceasefire proposal by the United States President Joe Biden to end the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, describing it as the \u201cbest way forward\u201d.

Despite the worsening weather, the helicopter lifted off for a trip about 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest to a new oil pipeline near Tabriz. Within an hour, the Bell 212 helicopter had crashed into a cloud-covered mountainside. While the cause of the May 19 crash remains unknown, the sudden death of the hard-line prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei exposed the contradictions and challenges facing the country\u2019s Shiite theocracy. The Iranian military investigators probing the crash have previously faced international criticism over their report on troops shooting down a Ukrainian airliner in 2020. The hourslong desperate rescue attempt after the helicopter crash saw Tehran even reach out to the United States for help, just weeks after launching an unprecedented attack on Israel and as it enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. Even the type of helicopter that crashed links back to Iranian history, both before and after the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution. \u201cIran is a culture of dualities,\u201d said Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy who studies Iran\u2019s military. \u201cSome aspects, they seem so good and well-managed, well-oiled and very capable. \u2026 In many levels, it\u2019s quite lacking.\u201d Iranian military investigators have released two statements on the crash, largely ruling out possibilities rather than offering a suspected cause. They\u2019ve rejected the possibility of an onboard \u201cexplosion caused by sabotage\u201d or a \u201ccyberattack\u201d targeting the Bell 212, a two-blade, twin-engine helicopter more widely known as the Huey for its use by the U.S. military in the Vietnam War. PHOTOS: Iran helicopter crash shows Tehran's reliance on an aging fleet as well as its challenges at home \u201cThe recorded conversations between the flight crew show that the last contact with the pilots up to the time of the incident and when they stopped responding lasted 69 seconds,\u201d the investigators said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. \u201cNo emergency declaration was recorded during that time.\u201d In conspiracy-minded Iran, some officials still insist foul play could have caused the crash. However, some other officials have begun to ask why the helicopter took off from the site of the new Giz Galasi Dam when the weather had started to turn. Mostafa Mirsalim, a member of the country\u2019s Expediency Council, wrote on the social platform X that he had asked prosecutors to \u201caddress the mistakes that led to the loss of the president and his delegation,\u201d without elaborating. Abbas Abdi, a prominent journalist, also wrote on X that the flight path taken by Raisi\u2019s helicopter suggested the pilot didn\u2019t follow a standard Iranian practice of shadowing main roads in rural areas. That can both help navigation and provide a safe landing area in an emergency. Former Iranian Presidents Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Abolhassan Banisadr both survived helicopter crashes while in office. The helicopter involved in the crash, nearly 30 years old, came directly from a Bell manufacturing plant in Montreal, Canada, to the Iranian air force, according to data from the firm Cirium. It counts 12 Bell 212 aircraft registered in Iran that are still in service. Bell Textron Inc., based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it \u201cdoes not conduct any business in Iran or support their helicopter fleet, and we do not have knowledge about the active state of the helicopter involved in this accident.\u201d But despite being decades old, the Bell 212 and its military counterpart the Huey still are flown around the world. In the United States, Hueys still fly as part of America\u2019s nuclear forces to support its silos and for some VIP missions, said Roger D. Connor, an aeronautics curator at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum in Washington. Over 440 still fly worldwide, according to Cirium. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple aircraft to fly by medium helicopter standards. It doesn\u2019t typically have much automation which can have both positive and negative implications for operators,\u201d Connor said. \u201cMore automation means more opportunities for pilot confusion in certain circumstances, but also better capabilities in low-visibility conditions.\u201d Iran\u2019s use of the Bell 212 remains pervasive, in part due to the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who struck deals to purchase hundreds of the helicopters and had plans to build a local variant, Nadimi said. Those already in the country at the time of the Islamic Revolution ended up being a key component of Iran\u2019s bloody war against Iraq in the 1980s. But as Western sanctions dried up the supply of parts, fewer of the aircraft were airworthy, despite efforts to locally overhaul them. That saw Iran engage in covert means to secure parts, sparking several U.S. criminal cases for those involved, who sought everything from safety equipment to full engines and night-vision goggles for the aircraft. Former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sought to blame sanctions for the crash. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller responded by saying America was \u201cnot going to apologize for our sanctions regime at all\u201d as Iran has used aircraft to \u201ctransport equipment to support terrorism.\u201d \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the Iranian government that is responsible for the decision to fly a \u2026 helicopter in what was described as poor weather conditions, not any other actor,\u201d Miller said. Meanwhile, questions remain over why Iran couldn\u2019t find the helicopter for hours, even though one of the victims reportedly talked by cellphone with officials. Such calls, in theory, can be triangulated by security services. Also, it remains unclear if the helicopter had any emergency tracker, which are common on aircraft. While the investigation continues, Nadimi said he believed that the Bell 212 that flew Raisi did not have advanced avionics that could have been useful for low-visibility flight. However, he stressed that the major issue in the crash likely involves who allowed the flight to take off as the weather turned poor and whether the pilot faced pressure from his VIP passengers to make the journey no matter what. \u201cPilot error, human error might be to blame, but there was a chain of events that caused this crash, not just pilot error,\u201d Nadimi said. \u201cThat helicopter should have been able to clear that terrain and fly safely to its destination. They should not have been dispatched for flying.\u201d", "summary": "By the time Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi boarded his window seat on a helicopter ferrying him, the foreign minister and six others, thick clouds already had begun forming around the mountaintops along the Azerbaijan-Iran border.

He did not understand when singing it.\n\n\"I trust him because I know him. I know he is not racist. The act...I felt a little bit upset. But now, it is done. It is finished.\n\n\"Of course [I deleted my tweet] because we talked together, we play for the same club and badge and train together. Now I understand him. He understands me. Everybody is happy.\n\n\"Enzo is a big player in Argentina. I hope this has educated him a bit, because for sure, it is a different culture.\n\n\"For sure, I know Enzo. He is not racist. It is just the video is bad. It's not only Enzo. It's the Argentinian team.\n\n\"I posted [on X] this because I felt upset about the video. Enzo is in the video but if he was from another country, I would have posted the same thing. For sure, it was a big story because we play in the same team. But now it is done. I'm happy with this situation. He said sorry, I trust him and that is the most important thing.\"\n\nFofana and Fernandez both played in Chelsea's first pre-season win of the summer as Enzo Maresca's side bounced back from a dismal defeat to Celtic with a comprehensive 3-0 beating of Club America.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Fofana_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Fofana (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Maresca", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Maresca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Club Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3186,h_1792,x_731,y_50/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j46hwmdpazhm3gmx23.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777335", "eventUri": "eng-9777335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

New manager Enzo Maresca has insisted that the Blues are a happy camp. FIFA are still investigating the situation while the French FA threatens legal action against Fernandez and Argentina.\n\nChelsea look to have drawn a line under Argentina's racism row this week as Enzo Fernandez's apology has reportedly been met with positive reactions as the Blues continue their pre-season tour in the USA.\n\nIf Enzo Maresca's job wasn't already difficult enough after replacing the departing Mauricio Pochettino, life was made more difficult for the former Leicester City coach when Fernandez uploaded a video to his Instagram story that showed Argentine players taking part in racist chants against French players following their Copa America victory.\n\nAt the time, the racism row caused a fallout in the Chelsea camp, with Wesley Fofana publicly condemning his actions, followed by several French players unfollowing Fernandez on various social media platforms.\n\nBut according to reports from the Sun, it now appears that Fernandez and Co have finally put the incident to bed, with Maresca recently lifting the lid on clear-the-air talks.\n\nRelated\n\nEnzo Fernandez Apologises to Chelsea Players, Makes Donation\n\nChelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has apologised to his team-mates in Atlanta.\n\nWhat Enzo Maresca Said\n\nThe Italian has made a concerted effort to keep spirits high\n\nAccording to the same report, while most within the squad have accepted that things will be back to normal, sources claim there was still an awkward air as the group trained again for the first time. But for new manager Maresca, the relief comes in the notion that the fallout at the time of the incident hasn't lingered as badly as first anticipated.\n\nThis also comes after the club have wound up an internal probe, with Fernandez's donation to an anti-discrimination charity effectively seen as a fine. Moving on is rule number one for Maresca, who insisted that his team are a happy camp. He told the Sun:\n\n\"We all feel very comfortable, very good, as Enzo is back. He had a chat with all of us just to clarify there were no bad intentions and the lads all accepted that.\n\n\"Since yesterday's session, everything was like before in terms of they were all together, all speaking, all laughing. Normal situation.\"\n\nHe also went on to reveal that the players and coaches had a meeting about the situation to clear the air. On this, he added: \"It was between me, Enzo, and a few players to just clarify the situation. There is nothing more to add. There is not any mystery behind it. We all make mistakes. We have to be good to apologise as sometimes we struggle even to apologise. Enzo had already apologised four or five times.\"\n\nMaresca confirmed that Fofana was among those to be a part of the meeting, while having insisted that Fernandez's actions were a mistake rather than something done \"with bad intentions\".\n\nFIFA Could Yet Punish Fernandez\n\nFrench FA chiefs are also threatening legal action against Argentina\n\nWhereas things look to be on the up again at Chelsea, the same can't be said externally for Fernandez and his national side. It remains to be seen whether the midfielder will be available for the opening Premier League game of the 2024/25 season as FIFA continues to investigate the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, French FA chiefs have taken a different approach to the companionable methods taken up by Chelsea and its players. Instead, they are threatening legal action, condemning the chant in a statement that read:\n\n\"Faced with the seriousness of these shocking remarks. Contrary to the values of sport and human rights, the president of the FFF decided to directly challenge his Argentine counterpart. And [have spoken to] Fifa to file a legal complaint for insulting remarks of a racial and discriminatory nature.\"", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_mumford@givemesport.com", "name": "Robin Mumford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Maresca", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Maresca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Fofana_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Fofana (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Pochettino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mauricio Pochettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills_and_Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills and Coaching", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/enzo-fernandez-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777335", "eventUri": "eng-9777335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

the first time back with his Chelsea team-mates after apologising for sparking a racism storm.\n\nFernandez filmed himself singing a controversial song aimed at France's black players after Argentina's Copa America triumph earlier this month, leading to several members of Chelsea's squad unfollowing him on Instagram.\n\nHe subsequently apologised on social media and has since addressed his team-mates personally while also pledging to make a charity donation, after joining up with the squad on their pre-season tour of the US.\n\nChelsea have now released pictures of Fernandez on their official X account showing the Argentine midfielder relaxing in a pool.\n\nWith Fernandez showing off his array of tattoos, the picture appears to show him in positive spirits and is captioned 'With the squad' alongside a fist bump emoji.\n\nEnzo Fernandez has been pictured for the first time with his Chelsea team-mates after sparking a racism storm\n\nHe was seen relaxing in a pool on the

apologises to Chelsea team-mates and pledges donation after joining up with squad\n\nThe French Football Federation was also disgusted as they released a statement which read: 'Faced with the seriousness of these shocking remarks, contrary to the values of sport and human rights, the president of the FFF decided to directly challenge his Argentine counterpart and FIFA and to file a legal complaint for insulting remarks of a racial and discriminatory nature.'\n\nThe song chanted by Fernandez and his Argentine team-mates dates back to the 2022 World Cup final in which Argentina beat France, with lyrics describing how French players are 'from Angola' or have a 'Nigerian' mother and a 'Cameroonian' father.\n\nThe chant had threatened to cause a split in the Chelsea squad, with Fofana, Malo Gusto and Axel Disasi unfollowing Fernandez on social media, while Nicolas Jackson showed his support to the \u00a3107m midfielder by posting a bizarre video of Fernandez playing with a black child.\n\nBut new Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca insisted he did not expect there to be an issue in the dressing room once Fernandez returned from his summer break following his apology.\n\nEnzo Maresca was confident Fernandez's behaviour would not split the dressing room, and the Argentine has now returned to the club after his summer break\n\nAnd the 23-year-old now appears to have settled back into life at the club just weeks on from the controversial video.\n\nHe could return to the pitch in the coming days when Chelsea take on Club America, Manchester City and Real Madrid to conclude their US trip.\n\nThey then have a friendly back at Stamford Bridge against Inter Milan before beginning their Premier League campaign against City on August 18.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

'We talked together. I explained why I didn't like the video. He explained. He said sorry because he did not want to hurt French fans or anyone. He did not understand when singing it.\n\n'And I trust him. Because I know him. I know Enzo. He is not racist. It is just the video is bad. It's not only Enzo. It's the Argentinian team. Enzo is in the video but if he was from another country, I would have posted the same thing. For sure, it was a big story because we play in the same team.\n\n'But now it is done, it's good. I'm happy with this situation because he understands me, I understand him, he said sorry, I trust him, and that is the most important thing. Enzo is a big player in Argentina. I hope this has educated him a bit, because for sure, it is a different culture.'\n\nFofana has since deleted his social media post as he explained: 'We play for the same club and badge and train together. Now I understand him. He understands me. Everybody is happy.'\n\nAsked if his opinion is shared by all of Chelsea's touring squad, Fofana said: 'We talked, all the team together. It was not only me and Enzo. It was everybody. We are in the same team and we need to go forward together. It is finished. We play together. We need to stay together. We're strong together.\n\nEnzo Fernandez previously filmed a video of the Argentina team singing a racist chant about France\n\nFofana has now deleted his tweet where he originally reposted the video via X alongside the words: 'Football in 2024: uninhibited racism'\n\nFofana (middle) and Fernandez (right) have since made amends after the Argentine apologised for his actions\n\n'If I'm on one side and Enzo is on the other side and we fight every day or we don't talk or we're not happy, on the pitch then we don't play well. That's not only me and Enzo. It's all the team. It is for that, that we talked. It's a good club.'\n\nFofana added he took no satisfaction in learning that Fernandez was losing money, with Chelsea also pledging to match his charitable donation. Instead, he feels it is more important that the wider world learns a lesson about respecting different cultures.\n\n'I don't care about the money,' Fofana added. 'He loses money. I don't want Enzo to lose money. The donation is good but the most important thing is not to repeat the act and that we educate everybody. He is an example because Enzo is a big player, a big star. He understands that and I'm happy like this.\n\n'I don't think a big sanction for Enzo is a good process. We need to educate about this because cultures are different, a lot of countries. We don't have the same education, for good or bad. But we need to educate everybody if we don't want a repeat.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Fofana_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Fofana (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/31/18/88003887-0-image-m-14_1722445214640.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777335", "eventUri": "eng-9777335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

He did not want to hurt French fans or anyone.\n\n\"He did not understand when singing it, I trust him. Because I know him. I know Enzo. He is not racist. I'm happy to see Enzo back.

Enzo is back, he had a chat with all of us to clarify there was no bad intention. The lads, they all accept it.\n\n\"Everything was like before, the players were all together, all speaking, all laughing.

We're really excited to get to work and hopefully have a really positive season.\"\n\nThe Argentina international has told Chelsea he will be making a significant contribution to an anti-discrimination charity - with Chelsea matching his contribution - and talks are now under way to decide where the best place to donate the funds will be.\n\nChelsea started disciplinary proceedings against Fernandez two weeks ago after he posted a video on social media which the French Football Federation said contained a racist song about France's black players.\n\nFernandez has been in contact with members of the squad following his public social media apology and private apology two weeks ago, but Monday was the first opportunity to apologise in person.\n\nFernandez, Chelsea captain Reece James and French defender Axel Disasi have been the lead figures in the consultation process with other Chelsea players.\n\nChelsea's disciplinary process against Fernandez is now closed with the player regarded as having been proactive in apologising in public and in private, and by pre-empting a fine by making a donation to fund anti-racism and anti-discrimination education.\n\nFernandez says he is sorry and is committed to anti-racism and anti-discrimination.\n\nWhen approached by Sky Sports News, Kick It Out referred back to their statement on July 17.\n\nSky Sports News understands the PFA contacted Chelsea to offer its support to players affected by the incident.\n\nIt did not wish to comment on Chelsea's internal investigation.\n\nSky Sports News has also contacted the French Football Federation, FIFA, and the FA for comment.\n\nJames accepts Fernandez racism row 'could be a problem' for Chelsea\n\nLast week, Blues skipper James admitted the racism storm surrounding Fernandez could be a \"problem\" within the dressing room.\n\nAsked if the issue could impact on team spirit at Stamford Bridge, James told ESPN: \"Of course.\n\n\"There's always the factor where it doesn't sit right with people when there could be a problem.\n\n\"But until the day comes where everyone's together and in a room together, I don't know, but I hope things can be resolved smoothly and we can move forward with the season.\"\n\nJames also revealed the conversations he had had with Fernandez before he rejoined the squad on Monday.\n\n\"I spoke to him a bit, but it was hard because we were on different time zones,\" the 24-year-old said.\n\n\"Just a general chat really. His views on what happened and him trying to explain his situation and how things happened.\n\n\"It's a really difficult situation. There's no room for racism or discrimination in football.\n\n\"I think he quickly put his hand up and acknowledged he'd done wrong and apologised to his team-mates, the club and the rest of the people that were offended.

Fofana took aim at \"uninhibited racism\" in a social media post after the footage went viral, but has since removed the post from his account.\n\nChelsea launched an investigation of their own after being made aware of the video. Fernandez himself issued an apology, saying he stands \"against discrimination in all forms\".\n\nPlayers involved in the latter stages of the Copa America and European Championships were given extra time off before returning to their club responsibilities. That included Fernandez, who spoke with Fofana and a number of other players upon his return.\n\n\"It's simple,\" Fofana told reporters. \"He arrived on Monday and we talked with the manager. We talked together.\" Fernandez is understood to have first met with a small group of players including Fofana, Reece James and Axel Disasi before addressing the wider group, with James and Disasi leading the efforts to reintegrate the former Benfica man.\n\n\"I explained why I didn't like the video. He explained, he said sorry because he did not want to hurt French fans or anyone,\" Fofana continued.\n\n\"He did not understand when singing it. He did not understand. And I trust him. Because I know him. I know he is not racist. The act, I felt a little bit upset. But now, it is done. It is finished. We play for the same club and badge and train together. Now I understand him. He understands me. Everybody is happy.\"\n\nIn addition to his apology, Fernandez has made a charitable donation, with Chelsea now considering the matter closed. However, Fofana argued education was more important than financial penalties if a repeat of the drama is to be avoided.\n\n\"I don't care about the money,\" the former Leicester defender said. \"He loses money. I don't want Enzo to lose money. The donation is good but the most important thing is not to repeat the act and that we educate everybody. He is an example because Enzo is a big player, a big star. He understands that and I'm happy like this.\n\n\"I don't think a big sanction for Enzo is a good process. We need to educate about this because cultures are different, a lot of countries. We don't have the same education, for good or bad. But we need to educate everybody if we don't want a repeat.\"\n\nChelsea are in the United States for pre-season. They have three of their five tour names remaining after drawing with Wrexham and losing to Celtic.\n\n\"I want to apologise sincerely for a video posted on my Instagram channel during the national team celebrations, the song includes highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words,\" Fernandez earlier said in his public apology.\n\n\"I stand against discrimination in all forms and apologise for getting caught up in the euphoria of our Copa America celebrations. That video, that moment, those words, do not reflect my beliefs or my character. I am truly sorry.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

the likes of Blues defender Wesley Fofana, who called out the \"uninhibited racism\" from his team-mate, will be able to move on quite so quickly.\n\nMaresca has passed his initial test by coping with the first of what will no doubt be a few crises.\n\nBut, for many, there will still be a sense of wait and see around just how warmly Fernandez is welcomed back -- not only by team-mates but by Chelsea fans and rival supporters, too.\n\nYou can be sure those in the away end at Stamford Bridge this season will be ready to revive this time and again across the season.\n\nChelsea and Maresca

But he must learn from this'", "body": "Fofana accused Fernandez and some of his fellow Argentina national team players of \"uninhibited racism\" after the midfielder live-streamed them signing a chant following their win over Colombia in the Copa America final earlier this month.\n\nFernandez issued a public and private apology soon afterwards but was only able to speak with Fofana, and other upset Chelsea players, face-to-face when he reported for pre-season training in Atlanta on Monday.\n\nFofana, who has deleted his 'uninhibited racism' post on X made a fortnight ago, insists he has forgiven the 23-year-old after holding clear the air talks and hopes the incident can turn into a positive by educating Fernandez and others.\n\n\"He (Fernandez) arrived (on Monday) and we talked with the manager (Enzo Maresca),\" Fofana said. \"We talked together. I explained why I didn't like the video. He (Fernandez) explained, he said sorry because he did not want to hurt French fans or anyone. He did not understand when singing it.\n\n\"I trust him because I know him. I know he is not racist. The act...I felt a little bit upset. But now, it is done. It is finished.\n\n\"Of course (I deleted my tweet) because we talked together, we play for the same club and badge and train together. Now I understand him. He understands me. Everybody is happy.\n\n\"Enzo is a big player in Argentina. I hope this has educated him a bit, because for sure, it is a different culture.\n\n\"For sure, I know Enzo (from being at Chelsea together since January 2023). He is not racist. It is just the video is bad. It's not only Enzo. It's the Argentinian team.\n\n\"I posted (on X about) this because I felt upset about the video. Enzo is in the video but if he was from another country, I would have posted the same thing. For sure, it was a big story because we play in the same team. But now it is done. I'm happy with this situation. He said sorry, I trust him and that is the most important thing.\"\n\nAs part of his bid to make amends, Fernandez has offered to make a donation to an anti-discrimination charity which the club will match through their foundation.\n\nFofana insists he never wanted Fernandez to be fined by Chelsea, who conducted an internal investigation over the incident.\n\nHe added: \"I don't care about the money. I don't want Enzo to lose money. The donation is good but the most important thing is not to repeat the act and that we educate everybody. He is an example because Enzo is a big player, a big star. He understands that and I'm happy like this.\n\n\"I don't think a big sanction for Enzo is a good process. We need to educate about this because cultures are different, a lot of countries. We don't have the same education, for good or bad. But we need to educate everybody if we don't want a repeat.\"\n\nFofana added Fernandez's expression of remorse has been accepted by everybody and that the squad is united as their pre-season tour of the United States continues.\n\n\"We talked, all the team together,\" the defender explained. \"It was not only me and Enzo. It was everybody. We are in the same team and we need to go forward together. Everybody spoke. And that's it. It is finished.\n\n\"Of course (we can get through this as a squad). We play together. We need to stay together. We're strong together.\n\n\"If I'm on one side and Enzo is on the other side and we fight every day or we don't talk or we're not happy, on the pitch then we don't play well. That's not only me and Enzo. It's all the team. It is for that, that we talked. It's a good club. The club tried to calm everything, and now it's all good and we're happy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_johnson@nytimes.com", "name": "Simon Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seko_Fofana", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seko Fofana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Maresca", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Maresca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/18042217/GettyImages-1471218725-scaled-e1722409847490.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777335", "eventUri": "eng-9777335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

However, recent photos on social media suggest that the rift has been mended, showing the players appearing reconciled.\n\nFofana has also shared his perspective in a recent interview, addressing the events following the video's release.\n\nSpeaking in an interview reported by Mail Sport, the 23-year-old French defender commented on the situation:\n\n\"Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez has apologised. He never intended to offend French fans or anyone else.\"\n\n\"He didn't fully understand the implications when he sang it, but I trust him. I know him well. I know Enzo.\"\n\n\"He is not racist.\"\n\nDiscussing their relationship further, the former Leicester City man added:\n\n\"I'm pleased to see Enzo back. We play together, and it's important for us to stay united. We're stronger together.\"\n\n\"If I'm on one side and Enzo is on the other, and we're not communicating or happy, we won't perform well. But everything is fine now.\"\n\nWith Fern\u00e1ndez returning to Chelsea training, the pair may play together for the first time since the incident in their preseason match against CF Am\u00e9rica on August 1.\n\nEarlier, Legit.ng reported that Enzo Fernandez has apologised after being caught on video celebrating Argentina's Copa America victory singing some racist chants in the team bus.\n\nThe major talking point was a viral video posted on Fernandez's Instagram page rendering a song from the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which seems offensive to French players.\n\nThe viral video earned the former Benfica midfielder a global condemnation, and his Chelsea teammate, a French international, Wesley Fofana, also joined the fans in criticising the Argentine.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."}, "authors": [{"uri": "chukwu_ikechukwu@legit.ng", "name": "Chukwu Ikechukwu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Fofana_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Fofana (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Club Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Click and follow now!\n\nEnzo Fernandez and his Chelsea teammates have recently been in the spotlight after the Argentine midfielder posted a video on social media of himself and his countrymate singing a racist song.\n\nThe now-viral video, which surfaced following La Albiceleste's historic 16th Copa America title, features members of the squad singing a song targeting the French national team based on their mixed ancestry.\n\nThe video sparked significant backlash from several Chelsea players who represent the French national team, with Wesley Fofana particularly voicing his disapproval of the midfielder's actions.\n\nThe fallout from the video led to speculation about the future of Enzo's relationship with his Chelsea teammates. However, recent photos on social media suggest that the rift has been mended, showing the players appearing reconciled.\n\nFofana has also shared his perspective in a recent interview, addressing the events following the video's release.\n\nSpeaking in an interview reported by Mail Sport, the 23-year-old French defender commented on the situation:\n\n\"Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez has apologised. He never intended to offend French fans or anyone else.\"\n\n\"He didn't fully understand the implications when he sang it, but I trust him. I know him well. I know Enzo.\"\n\n\"He is not racist.\"\n\nDiscussing their relationship further, the former Leicester City man added:\n\n\"I'm pleased to see Enzo back. We play together, and it's important for us to stay united. We're stronger together.\"\n\n\"If I'm on one side and Enzo is on the other, and we're not communicating or happy, we won't perform well. But everything is fine now.\"\n\nWith Fern\u00e1ndez returning to Chelsea training, the pair may play together for the first time since the incident in their preseason match against CF Am\u00e9rica on August 1.\n\nYEN.com.gh in another report detailed how Arsenal's coach, Mikel Arteta, aimed a subtle jibe at Chelsea.\n\nThe 42-year-old, during his press conference, touched on Riccardo Calafiori rejecting the London club in favor of Arsenal.", "source": {"uri": "yen.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yen.com.gh - Ghana news."}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_nutakor@yen.com.gh", "name": "Richard Nutakor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Fofana_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Fofana (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Club Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.yen.com.gh/images/1200x675/1171308e38888136.jpeg?v=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777335", "eventUri": "eng-9777335", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1860, "textEnd": 1868}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

They won on penalties after a titanic battle over 120 minutes in which their best players took centre stage, with Lionel Messi scoring twice and Kylian Mbappe netting a hat-trick.\n\nRelations between the countries have become strained in the aftermath of the final in Doha. Before the game, Argentine fans sang a song that has racist connotations about French players of African heritage.\n\nThe song includes the words: \"They play for France, but their parents are from Angola. Their mother is from Cameroon, while their father is from Nigeria. But their passport says French.\"\n\nFrench anti-racism movement SOS Racisme stated that the song is an \"expression of a far-right ideology\".\n\nIt also makes transphobic slurs against Mbappe, who was taunted by Argentine players after the World Cup final. During celebrations in Buenos Aires, Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez posed with a doll with Mbappe's face on it.\n\nTensions escalated further in July when Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez filmed himself and other members of Argentina's squad singing the song after their win against Colombia in the Copa America final.\n\nIn response to the video, the French Football Federation (FFF) pledged to file a legal complaint against the Argentine Football Association to Fifa for \"racist and discriminatory remarks\" that are \"contrary to the values of sport and human rights\".\n\nSeveral of Fernandez's Chelsea colleagues unfollowed him on social media after the incident and France defender and club teammate Wesley Fofana, whose father is from the Ivory Coast, described the video as \"uninhibited racism\". Former France captain and ex-Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris said it was an \"attack on French people\".\n\nFernandez, who joined Chelsea for \u00a3107m from Benfica a month after the World Cup final, issued an apology on his Instagram page, saying \"there is absolutely no excuse for these words,\" and that the song and its contents \"do not reflect my beliefs or my character\".\n\nThe 23-year-old apologised to his Chelsea teammates in person on Monday after joining up with the squad in Atlanta for their pre-season tour of the United States. He has also offered to make a significant donation to an anti-discriminatory charity.\n\nChelsea launched internal disciplinary procedure against Fernandez that has reportedly now been closed. New manager Enzo Maresca has insisted that the squad have \"all accepted\" the midfielder's apology.\n\nLast Friday, Argentina's populist right-wing president Javier Milei met French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss trade relations. The recency of the post-Copa America celebrations will have certainly added a diplomatic edge to those talks.\n\nArgentina's football and rugby sevens teams have been whistled and booed by French fans during the Olympics.\n\nThe football team led by Javier Mascherano can expect an even frostier reception on Friday night when they go head-to-head against Les Bleus.\n\nFour members of Mascherano's squad - Nicolas Otamendi, Geronimo Rulli, Julian Alvarez and Thiago Almada - won the World Cup in 2022 and with the exception of new Lyon signing Almada, all featured in the Copa America success this summer. By contrast, none of the French squad at this Olympics featured in the last World Cup.\n\nThe winner on Friday will be well placed to win a gold medal, with Spain the only other traditional powerhouse of international football still in the competition.\n\nA victory for France would go some way to avenging that defeat in Qatar.

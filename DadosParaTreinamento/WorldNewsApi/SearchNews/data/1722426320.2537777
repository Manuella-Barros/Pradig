Welcome to the strangely exacting world of hobby horsing, the Finnish sport guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Immaculately coiffed equestrians leap athletically over fences just like in horse jumping, going as fast as they can against the clock straddling their stick steeds. Things are more stately in the dressage, with riders trotting their stick horses with intricately decorated stuffed heads before the discerning eyes of the judges. Some 260 riders from 22 countries \u2013 mostly women and girls aged between 10 and 20 \u2013 turned up to compete at the 11th annual Finnish championship held in the town of Seinajoki. But despite its vast international reach, from the Arctic to Argentina, hobby horsing is a sport that dares not speak its name. Despite its soaring popularity, it is not officially recognised as a proper sport in its birthplace. \u201cWe have faced so much bullying and judgment,\u201d rider Nara Arlin, 24, says. \u201cWe know what everyone in the hobby horsing [world] has been through \u2026 I think that is the main thing that pulls us together.\u201d Invented in Finland more than a decade ago, hobby horsing has taken off at a gallop across the globe. \u201cIt is growing every year,\u201d says Julia Mikkonen, the chair of The Finnish Hobbyhorse Association. This year\u2019s championship was \u201cthe biggest we have had so far\u201d, she adds. Beyond the whimsy, great strength and skill is required to jump the obstacles while holding the hobby horse. Some top competitors could give elite hurdlers or gymnasts a run for their money. \u201cIf you jump over obstacles, your hip mobility has to be absolutely insane,\u201d says Mikkonen, 20, with some fences up to 110cm (3.6 feet) tall. She estimates there are around 10,000 hobby horsers globally. \u201cOf course we are all dreaming of having a world championship one day.\u201d Jojo Hanninen, 19, sits down after her dressage event. \u201cI am still a bit breathless but I am happy with my performance,\u201d she says. To succeed in the sport you have to channel your inner centaur, she says. \u201cIn hobby horsing, my legs are the horse \u2026 I am both horse and human,\u201d she says. Hanninen\u2019s hobby horse is a grey called Toope, with glittery reins and pink ribbons adorning its white mane. Competitors go to great lengths with their horses \u2013 which are also exhibited and judged \u2013 modelling and sewing the heads and adorning them with decorations. \u201cHobby horses are art,\u201d says Arlin, who makes her own. With the cheers of the crowd still ringing in her ears after an impressive show-jumping round, she hailed the sport as \u201cthe best hobby ever\u201d. \u201cYou are doing so many things with your hands, brain and the whole body.\u201d Like many of her peers, Arlin found hobby horsing through play as a child. \u201cBut the older I became, it became more serious,\u201d says the rider, who trains by riding real horses, working out in the gym and doing pole dancing. Rainbow flags in the arena reflected the tolerant values underpinning the community. \u201cHorses are mostly seen as a girls\u2019 sport, but that is not correct. Anyone can come no matter what gender,\u201d Mikkonen says. Every enthusiast spoken to praised the welcoming community that kept them devoted to hobby horsing despite the scornful attitudes all encountered at some point. \u201cWe have each other\u2019s backs,\u201d Arlin says.", "summary": "The 2024 Finnish Hobbyhorse Championships saw some 260 people from 22 countries take part in show jumping and dressage competitions, but riders say they have faced a difficult track on the way.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/3268298/how-hobby-horsing-galloping-ahead-sport-show-jumping-and-dressage-competitions", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/27/809d0c17-cc8c-47c8-97c7-6c11ca7cfecf_67072572.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:15:09", "author": "Agence France-Presse", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.415}

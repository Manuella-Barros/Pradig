The Health Committee Chairman stated this while speaking with Sunday PUNCH after the committee conducted its oversight function at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Kwara State on Friday. Magaji also cautioned citizens against taking cheap drugs from roadside health vendors, adding that they should take prescriptions from experts and renowned pharmacies in the country to live long. He said, \u201cMany Nigerians are used to taking different types of drugs including agbo (local herbs) and other drugs not prescribed by medical experts without thinking of their effects and that is why cases of renal and liver diseases are becoming rampant among our people. \u201cNigerians should desist from taking unprescribed drugs, they should seek medical advice from experts before they take drugs when they are sick. \u201cThough people are complaining of the high cost of drugs in the country, it is better to take expensive drugs than to take cheap drugs that will send you to an early grave.\u201d Magaji also lamented that most Nigerians do not usually bother about their health until the time they are sick and get admitted into the hospital and urged people to visit the hospitals and conduct medical tests on their health status to enjoy a long life and good health. Also speaking, the Chief Medical Director of UITH, Prof Abdullahi Yusuf appreciated the committee for their visit and stated that they should ensure that medical tourism is brought to the minimum.", "summary": "<p>The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Health, Amos Magaji, has advised Nigerians to avoid taking medications that are not prescribed by medical experts when they are ill.

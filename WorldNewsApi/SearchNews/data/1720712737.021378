Brian Johnson, 56, who lives in Essex, said his 16-year-old \u201cput all his effort into raising some money\u201d by doing paper rounds to save up for a bike to go to and from college. But within a few weeks somebody stole the motorbike, with the thief taunting Mr Johnson as he rode up and down the road in front of him. \u201cI'm thinking: Is this for real? That\u2019s my son\u2019s bike. It\u2019s got his name across the bike,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I called the police. The police said: \u2018We can't attend. There's no officers available to attend.\u2019\u201d Mr Johnson attempted to follow the thief in his car and then chase him on foot before the criminal got away with the motorbike. \u201cWe found it a week later all smashed up\u2026 My son, he tried, but it was beyond repair,\u201d Mr Johnson said. After talking to Mr Starmer about his story, he said hearing about the Labour leader\u2019s experience as Director of Public Prosecutions made him support Labour's plans to tackle crime even more. \u201cThis is a guy who\u2019s not just come through with a silver spoon sort of thing. He\u2019s actually been there and done it and he knows what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for a change because what this Government is doing - we\u2019re a sinking ship.\u201d Asked if he welcomed Labour\u2019s plans to put 13,000 more police officers and community support officers on the streets, Mr Johnson responded: \u201cA million percent.\u201d Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described Mr Johnson\u2019s situation as a \u201ctotal nightmare\u201d. \u201cThe feeling people have now is that something goes wrong in their lives, you have crimes being committed, no one comes and nothing is done,\u201d she said. She spoke about experiencing \u201cintimidating behaviour\u2019 when she was in Bristol during the campaign for last month\u2019s local elections. \u201cWhile we were doing the interviews on the streets, there was an off-road biker with a balaclava who just kept circling round and round,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was absolutely intimidating. The cameraman felt intimidated. So for the residents who have got this going on the whole time, it must be a total nightmare.\u201d Police will be given new powers to scrap noisy dirt and quad bikes within 48 hours, with tougher on-the-spot fines issued to offenders, under a Labour government.", "summary": "The dad of a teenager whose motorbike was stolen and dumped said he 'one million percent' backed Labour leader Keir Starmer's plans to crack down on antisocial behaviour", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/dad-backs-labours-police-plans-32993143", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32993046.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Keir-Starmer.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:51:36", "author": "Sophie Huskisson,Sophie-Huskisson", "authors": ["Sophie Huskisson", "Sophie-Huskisson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.674}

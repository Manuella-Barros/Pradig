{"id": 225028658, "title": "PwC agrees deal to become OpenAI's first reseller and largest enterprise user", "text": "It marks the first time OpenAI has agreed a resale model of selling its popular AI products. The company is reportedly losing hundreds of millions of dollars due to the huge computing costs associated with generative AI. It has been increasingly turning to premium subscriptions and enterprise sales as a way to make money from AI. In February 2023, OpenAI launched a paid version of ChatGPT, called ChatGPT Plus. Later that year, in August, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Enterprise, a higher-security version of its chatbot targeted at businesses. The deal announced Wednesday also forms part of PwC's broader push into AI. In April last year, PwC announced it intends to commit $1 billion of investment over three years to expand and scale its capabilities in AI. PwC says it has been developing custom GPTs to help its workforce review tax returns, generate proposal responses, and generate reports and dashboards. PwC says it's also been helping its clients accelerate implementation of generative AI, having identified over 3,000 internal use cases spanning different industries.", "summary": "PwC landed a deal Wednesday with OpenAI to become the artificial intelligence company's first resale partner and largest enterprise user.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/pwc-to-become-openais-first-reseller-and-largest-enterprise-user.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107421193-1716983264200-gettyimages-1247904351-cros-notitle230307_npU3m.jpeg?v=1716983872", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:53:31", "author": "Ryan Browne", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.116}

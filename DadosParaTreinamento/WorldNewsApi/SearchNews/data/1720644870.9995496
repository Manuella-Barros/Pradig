(Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) You may not have considered holidaying in Algeria, but the North African country is hoping you won\u2019t write it off just yet. Just 3.3 million foreign tourists visited Algeria in 2023, an estimated 1.2 million of whom were Algerians from the disapora seeing their families. Meanwhile, tourist-friendly Morocco welcomed 14.5 million \u2013 despite the fact it\u2019s a smaller and less wealthy nation. Algeria\u2019s government is now looking to rival its neighbour, setting targets to increase numbers fourfold and attract 12 million tourists by 2030. Saliha Nacerbay, general director of the National Tourism Office, said: \u2018To achieve this, we, as the tourism and traditional industry sector, are seeking to encourage investments, provide facilities to investors, and build tourist and hotel facilities.\u2019 Around 2,000 such projects have been approved, and restoration or expansion plans are also underway for 249 around the country. Tourism bosses hope Algeria will be the next Morocco (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) But although it\u2019s been described as an \u2018undiscovered gem\u2019 due to its gorgeous landscapes and rich culture, many travellers are still wary of Algeria \u2013 and for pretty good reason. As well as safety concerns, issues like an inflexible visa system and poor transport links have been flagged by analysts, with French tourist Patrick Lebeau commenting: \u2018Obviously, there is a lot of tourism potential, but much work still needs to be done to attract us.\u2019 So what do you need to be aware of before taking a trip to Algeria, and why is it worth a spot on your list of up-and-coming destinations to try? Some tour operators offer visitors the chance to ride camels and camp out in the Sahara (Picture: Getty Images) Why to visit Algeria There\u2019s a lot to love about Algeria, from a wealth of historical sites to stunning beaches, mountains and Saharan desert. You\u2019re spoilt for choice when it comes to natural beauty: sleep on sand dunes under the stars by night and sandboard by day, ride camels with Tuareg nomads, swim in the azure Mediterranean sea, or marvel at the Ghoufi Canyon, which is one of Algeria\u2019s most stunning natural wonders. It makes sense to start your trip in Algiers, exploring wonders like the UNESCO World Heritage Site that is the capital\u2019s Kasbah citadel, as well as the Roman archieological site of Tipaza and the beautiful gardens in the nearby town of Blida. Head to Oran for clear blue seas and incredible vistas (Picture: Getty Images) Elsewhere, Constantine offers sights like the Emir Abdelkader Mosque and the Palace of Ahmed Bey, the Tassili N\u2019Ajjer National Park is home to stunning rock formations and ancient rock art, and Oran features a wealth of beach spots and cultural events. As Africa\u2019s largest country, you aren\u2019t short of things to see, and a flight from the UK only takes around three hours, so you don\u2019t have to travel too far to do so. Travel writer Richard Collett called Algeria \u2018intoxicating\u2019, and echoed the words Albert Camus wrote upon visiting Tipaza: \u2018I understand here what we call glory: the right to love without measure.\u2019 High praise indeed. The city of Constantine is full of breathtaking sights (Picture: Getty Images) Things to consider before visiting Algeria Despite its many wonders and the effort being taken to make it more agreeable among tourists, there are still some barriers to travel in Algeria. The FCDO currently advises against travel within 30km of Algeria\u2019s borders with Libya, Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Tunisia, as there is a high risk of terrorism or kidnap of British nationals in these areas. You also need to apply for a Visa at the Algerian consulate in the UK before you can enter the country, although certain tour operators will handle this for you as part of a travel package. There are a number of other benefits to visiting Algeria with a reputable company\u2019s guidance: they can ensure you\u2019re provided with security escorts where necessary and help keep you safe in busy spots like the Algiers Kasbah. According to the government website, \u2018driving can be erratic\u2019 so pedestrians should \u2018take particular care when crossing roads on foot, even where there is a signal allowing you to do so.\u2019 You should also be aware and respectful of the fact that Algeria is a largely Muslim country, which means dressing and acting in accordance with local customs and not being under the influence of alcohol in public places (which is illegal). It\u2019s certainly not a standard sun holiday, but if you abide by the rules and take necessary precautions, it could end up being the trip of a lifetime. Do you have a story to share?

Bose earlier in the day criticised Banerjee for her remarks and stated it was expected of public representatives not to create \u201cerroneous and slanderous impressions. The Bengal governor also filed a defamation suit against certain TMC leaders for making similar remarks, the source said. During an administrative meeting in the state secretariat, Banerjee on Thursday claimed that \u201cWomen have informed her they are afraid to visit Raj Bhavan due to recent incidents reported there\u201d. \u201cGovernor CV Ananda Bose on Friday moved the Calcutta High Court and filed a defamation suit against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her party leaders for their comments,\u201d the source told PTI. On May 2, a contractual woman employee of Raj Bhavan had alleged molestation by Bose following which the Kolkata Police also started a probe. When contacted, TMC Rajya Sabha MP Dola Sen said that she would not be able to comment on the matter without discussing it with the party leadership. \u201cI have to talk to my party leadership to find out what actually happened. This is quite a sensitive matter,\u201d Sen told PTI. Senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha said that Bose took the right decision. \u201cI think Governor Bose has taken the right decision. He should have taken this decision long back. I fully support him for this,\u201d Sinha said. Veteran CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said that the tussle between Bose and Banerjee is not helping the state. \u201cIt\u2019s actually taking us down. They seem to have forgotten their Constitutional responsibilities. Their acts are damaging West Bengal\u2019s image at the national level,\u201d Chakraborty.", "summary": "Bose earlier in the day criticised Banerjee for her remarks and stated it was expected of public representatives not to create \"erroneous and slanderous impressions", "url": "https://www.news18.com/politics/bengal-guv-files-defamation-suit-against-mamata-for-unsavoury-remarks-8948403.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/bengal-governor-ananda-bose-mamata-banerjee-2024-05-620b42b1b80006c854e7cdbef36abc53-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:18:32", "author": "News18", "authors": ["News18"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.509}

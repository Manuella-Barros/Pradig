Dan Lee, 30, Army veteran, has recently launched his new Farina Pasta Bar food truck with the support of a nonprofit \u201cfood truck incubator\u201d for veterans and active military spouses.The Sayreville native joined up after high school, serving through 2015. \u201cYou meet a lot of different people,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s really diverse \u2014 you have to learn to work with all of them in different situations.\u201d Lee worked in the bomb squad in a 60-person unit in Georgia. \u201cSometimes people would find things in grandad\u2019s war chest, like old grenades from World War II, sometimes something would just show up in the Savannah Port or we\u2019d respond to something at the airport.\u201d he said. The Mount Airy, Penn., resident enjoyed cooking whenever he could, influenced by his mother, a former food scientist. He gleaned her skills, like whipping up pasta sauce from scratch. So, after the Army, Lee pursued a degree in culinary arts at Drexel University in Philadelphia, paid for by his military service. Then, while studying abroad in Rome, a lightbulb went off. \u201cI realized there\u2019s no fast-casual pasta [in the US] that\u2019s made in-house,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to bring \u2014 this casual dining experience where you get fresh pasta, great sauce and it\u2019s not going to cost you $30 a plate.\u201d Lee began working at restaurants, in a pizzeria and brewery, and drove for DoorDash and Uber. His research chef internship at Campbell\u2019s made him realize that working for other people was not ideal, so he bought and operated a food truck. However, this fell flat when Lee and a business partner got scammed out of $70,000, which he had saved during his military service. But, when life handed him lemons, Lee made limoncello. He discovered \u201cghost kitchens,\u201d essentially apartments for restaurateurs who only sell online. \u201cIt\u2019s a great redemption story,\u201d said Lee who dug into his militia chops for resilience. \u201cYou just keep pushing forward.\u201dThe 200-square-foot kitchen that opened in October 2020 was a hit. \u201cCustomer satisfaction was there. They liked the food, the concept. That\u2019s what kept moving us forward.\u201d This expanded into a restaurant, Farina Pasta and Noodle, in Rittenhouse Square, Philadelphia, in 2021, followed by a full-circle moment after receiving a LinkedIn message from Jordan Foley, 35, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Let\u2019s Chow. They offer a free \u201cfood truck MBA\u201d for military veterans and active military spouses. Foley himself is currently on active duty as a lieutenant commander in the Navy and national security attorney at the Pentagon, running Let\u2019s Chow as a part-time, unpaid CEO. Foley informed Lee about an available food truck in Atlantic City. Though Lee is more advanced than other fellows just starting, Foley said the program is self-paced and \u201ccompletely hands-on. If you have the drive, if you have the ability and you care about it, we\u2019re going to get you to where you need to go.\u201d Foley\u2019s goal for Let\u2019s Chow is to be \u201chyper-focused on one industry to take a veteran from zero knowledge to business. Food trucks became the perfect business incubator.\u201d Since launching in January 2020 and getting funding from grants and donations, Let\u2019s Chow has helped 57 people in over 20 businesses and launched five food trucks. Foley, who earned a culinary degree, closely administers the online applications and the program. Fellows receive $1,500 stipends for each of the four phases of learning, mixed between online and in-person, typically taking 400 hours to complete. When fellows start making a profit at their truck, they stop earning stipends. The nonprofit taps into marketing agencies, pro bono attorneys, accountants, food photographers and other resources to help fellows with logos, accounting, licensing, food law and more. Then, \u201cthey\u2019re in charge of sourcing and buying ingredients, marketing,\u201d said Foley. He now wants to add more trucks and create Chow Hall, a full-service incubator with a cohort of veterans, kitchen space, dine-in, storage, trucks, food pantry and office space. \u201cWe cover [truck] insurance, maintenance, regulatory fees. They pay us rent, but it covers the insurance, so it\u2019s a way for us to own it and have a little skin in the game. We\u2019re not a program forever, we\u2019re meant to be moved on to,\u201d said Foley. After talking with Foley, Lee thought it was \u201ca no-brainer\u201d and his Farina Pasta Bar revved up its engine last month. Menu items include vodka sauce with gnocchi, pistachio pesto with spaghetti alla chitarra, gelato and sorbet. Lee\u2019s leasing the truck for three years, with a vision for servicing pop-up events, weddings and corporate events in New Jersey, Philly and beyond. He shares its whereabouts on Instagram \u2014 the next event will be in Millville at the TD Bank music and food truck festival at New Jersey Motorsports Park on June 8.Lee credits his Army days as the secret sauce to his success. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have been able to do what I do now had I not been in the military because of the sheer amount of work that it takes. You work at it every day,\u201d said Lee, who\u2019s up at the crack of dawn, manages five employees and works until 10 p.m. \u201cYou get home, you wake up and do it again the next day. You have to do that consistently. A lot of that discipline comes from the military.\u201d With this tenacious, mission-focused work ethic, Lee has sights on expanding nationally to compete with brands like Chipotle and Cava, adding more trucks and having a presence on military bases. Channeling his inner Frank Sinatra, Lee said, \u201cIf we can make it here in the Northeast, then we should be doing great everywhere else.\u201d", "summary": "Foley said the program is self-paced and \u201ccompletely hands-on.

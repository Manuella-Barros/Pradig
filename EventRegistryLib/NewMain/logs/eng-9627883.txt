Monday but could not hold because of the nationwide strike, Channels TV reported.\n\nMr Ogunleye drew the judge's attention to an earlier order directing all parties to file and exchange their processes based on abridgement of time and accelerated hearing granted in respect of the suit.\n\nAccording to Channels TV, some of the defendants were not in court and were not represented by legal practitioners, prompting the lawyer to request for a short adjournment.\n\nThe judge adjourned the case to 28 June for hearing but warned that he would not entertain further delay from any party in the suit.\n\nBackground\n\nEdo assembly had overwhelmingly voted to remove Mr Shaibu after adopting the report of the panel constituted by the state chief judge to investigate the allegations of perjury and disclosure of government secrets levelled against the former deputy governor by the lawmakers.\n\nIn his first reaction after he was removed from office, Mr Shaibu said the lawmakers have betrayed the trust of the Edo people, adding that he was removed from office because of his governorship ambition.\n\nMr Shaibu, who said the legal system will vindicate him, has vowed to challenge his impeachment at the court.\n\nThe former deputy governor has had a prolonged political feud with Governor Godwin Obaseki over his governorship ambition which the governor does not support.\n\nHis removal was the peak of his political rift with Mr Obaseki, who described his former deputy as being \"overambitious\" for aspiring to succeed him.\n\nMr Shaibu was replaced by Omobayo Godwins, a 38-year-old engineer.\n\nMr Godwins, a former member of the Labour Party, lost the 2023 House of Representatives election for Akoko-Edo Federal Constituency and later defected to the Peoples

That's the sound my cherry pitter makes when I'm removing the seeds from the fruit. Every year, I think, \"Cherries? Already?\" But here we are in full cherry season (the window between blossoms and ready-to-harvest fruit is so short). And I have pounds of them. One of the great things about cherries (besides their burst of deliciousness and gorgeous garnet color) is that they're picked when ripe, unlike many other stone fruit, so if you're buying them at the supermarket, they're often as juicy and flavorful as ones from farmer's markets. Cherry juice squirts as far as the backsplash on my counter, splatters my clothes, stains my fingers. It's worth it for pie. Or clafoutis. Or pavlova. Or upside down cake. Or brandied cherries. The latter might be one of the easiest ways to use cherries in a spectacular way. Cherries, brandy, red wine, Armagnac, orange liqueur, a vanilla pod, a little cinnamon, cracked black pepper and orange zest make these cherries especially delicious (and your kitchen will smell like spiced almond blossoms). Simmer these ingredients until the mixture is syrupy \u2014 it takes only about 20 minutes \u2014 and the brandied cherries can keep for months in the refrigerator. Use them over ice cream or on top of pavlova or with shortcakes and some whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. An easy cherry-dessert recipe is clafoutis. It bakes up like a big, custardy, fruity pancake-meets-flan-meets-souffl\u00e9. Remarkably, one traditional way to make cherry clafoutis is by using the fruit with the pits. So you don't have to remove any seeds (you just have to be careful about them when eating). Come to think of it, you could make the brandied cherries with the pits too. For clafoutis, fill the bottom of a casserole with cherries in a single layer. Whisk a few eggs, some flour, sugar, a little milk and cream, and pour this over the layer of cherries so that they're barely covered. Bake until the custard is just set (still jiggly in the center) and golden brown at the edges. Spoon it warm into bowls. But what's summer without cherry pie, baked until the fruit is gelled and the crust is crisp and flaky? Make a whole pie with a lattice crust or individually sized hand pies with a little rye flour in the dough for a nutty crust that complements cherries. Here are several cherry recipes for baking in the coming weeks, while the fruit is still around \u2014 the season goes by so fast. Eating out this week?

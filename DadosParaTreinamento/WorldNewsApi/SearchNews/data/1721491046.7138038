The club achieved seven wins and three runner-up medals across ten bouts. 22-year-old Kheva Potatau, known by the moniker \u201cthe Maori Ninja\u201d, is the current 67kg national champ, and the star of the stable after winning gold in the middleweight division. He was also awarded prizes for best scientific elite and most overall scientific boxer. Micah Potatau won gold in the 70kg Elite Female division, while 16-fight veteran Roman Makoare also won gold in the Junior male 75kg class and Byron Peters grabbed silver in the 70kg. 45 fighters ranging from teenagers to veterans train out of Revills Boxing which has a reputation for producing elite athletes. Another of the gym\u2019s products, Zimbabwe-born New Zealand representative Wendell Stanley, fought in the under 71kg category at the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games and was on hand when the Times visited. After competing in a qualifying meet in Bangkok earlier this month, Stanley sadly missed out on Olympic selection for this year\u2019s Paris Games after a contentious awarding of points to his opponent. \u201cHe got a crook decision,\u201d said Revill. \u201cI fought a guy from the Czech Republic, and everyone thought I won the fight, \u201csaid Stanley. \u201cI almost made it.\u201d Stanley said he will now set his sights on making a living from boxing; \u201cI\u2019ve been to the Commonwealth Games, and now I\u2019m looking at being a professional.\u201d With the talent on show at Revills Boxing Gym, it is not unfathomable that more fighters will reach the pinnacle of the sport.", "summary": "<p>Revills Boxing Gym in Pakuranga continued a proud tradition of producing champions after their young fighters cleaned up at the recent Northern Golden Gloves Championships in Tauranga.

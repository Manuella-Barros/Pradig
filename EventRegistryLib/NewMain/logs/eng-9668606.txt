If governments do not not take corrective measures, they may find themselves without their Jewish communities.\n\nJudenrein and Judenfrei were terms used by the Nazis to describe areas under their control in which no Jews were left -- and thus \"empty\" or \"free\". One can see the term Judenfrei in a document from the Wannsee Conference that summarized the disposition of 11 million European Jews prior to implementation of the Final Solution. One might note that while Israel is 20 percent Arab in population, all proposals for a Palestinian state demand that there be no Jew present in it.\n\nProbably one of the biggest mistakes that I make every day is perusing the news websites in the morning. Within just a few minutes today, I gleaned the following:\n\nA 74-year-old Jewish man in New York was spat upon and harassed by one of the city's many Hamas supporters.\n\nA Jewish member of the Australian parliament had his offices burned down in Melbourne.\n\nThugs tried to kidnap Jewish children in London while being taken for a walk by their father.\n\nSince Jews first came to Europe after the Roman conquest of Jerusalem and the Land of Israel, they have been subjected to a great deal of abuse. From formal state policies not allowing land ownership to organized pogroms, Jews for two millennia have taken abuse. But Jews have not fled. However much Jews suffered from governmental harassment or local religious persecution, Jews have done their best to live and grow. I could see from my parents and their friends that one of the most painful aspects of Hitler's plans for the Jews was to make them a formal enemy of the German state. German Jews for the most part felt very connected to their country and were quite patriotic. I have one of two Iron Cross medals from my grandfathers. The other one was thrown by my late maternal grandfather into the Atlantic as their steamer left German port. \"If they don't want me, then I don't want them,\" were his words when he sent the medal down to Davy Jones' Locker.\n\nThe recent explosion of antisemitic activity in ostensibly liberal Western countries definitely has not occurred in a vacuum. The immediate driver for the hatred on display in large cities and on manicured university lawns is Israel's war in Gaza. Unless one buys into Israel deserving the murder of 1,200 civilians and soldiers, then it was Hamas that started the war. Yet, it is Israel and the Jews who are taking the punishment in the West meted out by Hamas-supporting Muslims and their friends on the left. Any casual association with Jews or Judaism (and not necessarily Israel) is reason enough to be verbally assaulted, threatened, pushed around, or have fake blood thrown on the house, as happened to trustees of the Brooklyn Museum. It is open season on the Jews, who for the most part hunker down and pray that this storm, like its many predecessors, will pass.\n\nWestern politicians and police forces have not taken the threats to Jews seriously enough to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators. It would take about ten shoplifters in California to be either shot or put in jail for ten years to stop the multi-billion dollar thefts occurring there; similarly, if those who harass Jews or put antisemitic statements on statutes were looking down a thirty year jail sentence or irreversible deportation, things would change quickly. Like Hamas, their fanboys are cowards. Of course, the hatred in their hearts would not move an inch. But the real threat of jail time and destruction of one's personal and professional life would be enough to get 90 percent of the perpetrators out of the overt Jew-hatred business.\n\nUnfortunately, much of the hate occurs in liberal cities and countries, and as such, officials are loath to prosecute minorities or revoke visas if the criminals are guests in their Western host countries. They would rather coddle the antisemites than prosecute them. And while Jews will do their best to survive -- including hiring guards, putting up security cameras and having local patrols, some will decide that they have had enough for themselves and their kids. I know people who have moved here during a shooting war out of the belief that people hate Jews everywhere; at least in Israel, one knows who the enemy is and the government is actually quite involved in preventing violence against all of its citizens, including its Jewish majority. A potential war with Hezbollah may temporarily reduce aliyah to Israel, but I doubt that it will stop it completely. People are looking around and wondering if they have a future in the countries that their families have called home for generations.\n\nIf one wants to know what Judenrein countries look like, you have plenty of options on the menu. There are of course all of the poor and technologically-backwards Arab countries who drove out their Jews in the 1940s. You have China with its totalitarian government as well as its satellite, North Korea. Wherever Jews have set up communities, they have participated in the economic and social life of host countries. Many Jews served in their countries' armies in every war. Someone once told me of a French Jew who shot a German soldier in World War I. When he went over to the man he shot, he heard him saying a Jewish prayer that one is to say before death. Needless to say, the French soldier was devastated that he had killed a fellow Jew but he understood that he had done his job as a soldier of his nation. Jews play a part in the success of the countries in which they live. Allowing them to be attacked with impunity, especially by foreign visa-holders, is a disgrace. If the Jews one day just pack up and move away, don't think that you will have a better country for it. Whom do you want: the Jews or the loser Hamas-supporters? In short order, you may have to choose.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_joseph_bauer@townhall.com", "name": "Alan Joseph Bauer",

Jews are labeled as \"settler-colonialists\" and, based on this, the Jewish state is declared illegitimate and worth dismantling. The Jewish community needs to do more to educate students to counter such false claims. Specifically, it needs to drop its reluctance to marshal the science to make the case for Israel.\n\nThere is, of course, abundant historical, archaeological and linguistic evidence for the continuity of Jews over the millennia. The Jewish community has done a good job of teaching about that. But that is not enough. On campuses, such evidence is dismissed as old and faked. Today's Jews, particularly Ashkenazi Jews, are claimed to have little or no connection to ancient Israelites.\n\nSuch assertions can best be countered with evidence that is current and can't be faked. Such data is the information that we all carry in the sequence of our genes. Scientists have done fascinating studies of the genetics of Jews that have shown a solid connection to the Land of Israel.\n\nFor Ashkenazi Jews, about half the genome has Middle East origin. About 35% has southern European origin, added about 2,000 years ago when Jewish traders moved to Rome, with some Israelite men having children with European women. The other 15% is of Eastern and Western European origin, added in recent centuries as Jews migrated within Europe. Non-Ashkenazi Jews have substantial similarities to Ashkenazim, though with admixtures from different countries.\n\nUnfortunately, the Jewish community is reluctant to communicate the science to students. This is not just because Jewish communal leaders are non-scientists. There are historical memories that make Jews afraid to teach about genetics, as well as concerns that such knowledge will make converts feel less welcome. However, to make the case for Israel we must overcome this failure to educate on this science.\n\nJewish students need to know enough to counter the unfounded claims of colonialism that they will face. As an example, campus opponents of Israel cite 23andMe's classification of the Ashkenazi Jewish DNA pattern as \"European\" as meaning that Ashkenazim don't have a Middle Eastern origin. But this classification says nothing about the historical origin of Jews; it merely describes residence in recent centuries. The sloppiness of social media results in such claims circulating unchallenged. The same students who proclaim the mantra of \"follow the science\" about vaccines have a huge gap when it comes to the science showing the Israelite origin of Jews.\n\nIgnoring the genetics is corrosive to appreciating the connection of Jews to the Land of Israel and such ignorance undermines the legitimacy of the State of Israel.\n\nThe genetic evidence also reflects the richness of history. Of particular interest is that it shows that Jews and Palestinian Arabs are very related genetically. Some of this is due to common origins millennia ago, but some is due to Jews in the Land of Israel converting to Islam in many waves since the Muslim conquest.\n\nSome of the conversions are recent enough that \"Arab\" clans have oral traditions about their Israelite origins and follow customs such as carving Jewish stars over their doorways and lighting candles on Friday night. One well-described example is the townspeople of the town of Yatta, near Hebron.\n\nIgnoring the genetics is corrosive to appreciating the connection of Jews and \"Palestinian Arabs.\" Such ignorance could result in missing opportunities for eventual reconciliation.\n\nAs genetic testing is used more widely to diagnose rare diseases, the awareness of shared genetic variants among Jews and Arabs is increasing among physicians. However, such genetic evidence is rarely discussed publicly. Arabs are reluctant to make clear that Jews are indigenous to Israel and Jews are reluctant to discuss the fact that many Palestinian Arabs have some Jewish ancestors.\n\nNow is the time to transcend such fears of discussing the genetics. Making the science more known will make the discussion of the Arab-Israeli conflict more fact-based. This could be the best path forward to breaking the current Arab-Israeli deadlock.\n\nOnce you know that Jews are indigenous to Israel, the slogan \"from the water to the water Palestine will be Arab\" is clearly unjust. Once you know that many Palestinian Arabs are descended from Jews, an eventual reconciliation between Palestinian Arabs and Jews becomes easier to imagine, though such reconciliation seems far from imminent.\n\nThe Jewish community needs to overcome its inertia and start educating young people in the science, doing this through schools, programs such as Birthright trips and compendia such as Myths & Facts. Discussions at universities need to engage the science and get the upper hand over nonsense circulating on social media. Both need to create a climate of intellectual vitality in which people learn the science, which nudges towards justice and reconciliation.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Land of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ashkenazi Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israelites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Muslim_conquests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Early Muslim conquests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab\u2013Israeli_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab\u2013Israeli conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab citizens of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatta,_Hebron", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yatta, Hebron"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yatta, Hebron"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Educational_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Educational Resources", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Genetic_Programming", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Genetic Programming", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Segal-062124.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668606", "eventUri": "eng-9668606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Others insisted that the lessons of the Holocaust meant that Jews must not contribute to making refugees of another group of people: the Palestinians who were then living on the land.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theodor Herzl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Crow laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/294/29440/2944077.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668606", "eventUri": "eng-9668606", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Forms of the blood libel have been disseminated ever since the myth emerged in England in the 12th century with claims that Christian children were being ritually murdered by Jews in re-enactments of the crucifixion of Jesus. In the aftermath of 7 October, Labour's Rochdale by-election candidate Azhar Ali accused Israel of lowering its defences so that it could justify the shedding of innocent Palestinian blood. Gigi Hadid, the American model, shared a video which alleged that Israel is harvesting the organs of Palestinians. The International Criminal Court's pursuit of arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the defence minister Yoav Gallant amid claims of genocide has been denounced by Israel's UN ambassador Gilad Erdan and others as another manifestation of the ancient slander.\n\nThe original blood libel materialised after the First Crusade (1096-99), a turning point for Jews in Europe as a wave of religious frenzy swept communities away. Jews ritually murdered their own children in the Rhineland to prevent forced conversions. A Jewish account tells the story of Rachel of Mainz, who turned a knife on her four children before the crusaders could batter down her door. While earlier interreligious interaction was characterised by trade, the First Crusade transformed the Jews into a pressing danger.\n\nFrom the 12th century on, European Christians made a range of outlandish allegations against their Jewish neighbours. As well as ritual murder and blood libel claims, Jews were accused of committing violence upon stolen consecrated hosts. It was said that Jews poisoned wells to spread the plague during the Black Death. Underpinning such charges was the belief that all Jews were 'Christ-killers' and collectively responsible for deicide. The medieval Church may have condemned the blood libel and attacks on Jews, but this didn't prevent pogroms and expulsions. Politics and finance played a significant role. The cult of the blood libel 'martyr' Hugh of Lincoln (1246-55), the boy whose death was falsely attributed to Jews, flourished with royal approval from Edward I at the end of the 13th century in the context of the 1290 expulsion of the Jews from England, while Philip IV of France appropriated Jewish property and loans when he cast them out in 1306 amid money troubles.\n\nThere is a debate among historians over whether medieval Jew hatred contributed to modern forms of anti-Semitism (a word which emerged in the late 19th century) which culminated in the Holocaust. Hannah Arendt held that medieval and modern Jew hatred are fundamentally different because of the significant change in religious context. Others point to common and longstanding anti-Semitic stereotypes, such as physical deformity and usurious greed, as the key connection between the periods.\n\nIvan G. Marcus argues that 'a focus on stereotypes risks anachronism'. His riveting book, which concentrates on Ashkenaz (northern France, England and Germany), takes a structural approach to link medieval and modern anti-Semitism. Marcus thinks that medieval hatred has had long-lasting consequences through modern reinterpretations of 'the binary of inverted hierarchy' (medieval Christians and Jews thought the other group should be subordinate), the idea of the Jew as an internal enemy, and the concept of Jewish identity as unchangeable. To reach this conclusion, he challenges the widely held view of the medieval Jew as a passive victim and the most interesting sections in his book examine how Jews actively asserted themselves in the face of what they considered Christian idolatry. This stirred up Christian opposition towards them and gave them a more defined presence in European society.\n\nJewish assertiveness took some surprising, and in some cases smelly, forms. Marcus sets out the evidence for Jews using flatulence as a means of disrespecting Christian symbols at the time of the First Crusade. He recounts the story of Asher and Meir, who turned their backs on the cross in Trier and farted before being put to the sword. Christian statues were placed in toilets. Synagogues were built higher than churches and Jewish worship wasn't toned down. In business contracts with their Latin-reading contemporaries, Jews wrote offensive things about Christianity in Hebrew. A new eucharist-like ritual, in which youths ate cakes and eggs inscribed with passages from the Torah, was created by pietist Jews to discourage conversion. Through an adroit selection of sources, both Jewish and Christian, Marcus brings the subject matter to life.\n\nMedieval Europe created what Marcus calls 'the imagined Jew'. While Jews were assertive, there was a limit, and even after they had been expelled fantastical myths and deep-seated hatreds continued. Some of England's greatest writers must share the blame. Chaucer recounts a blood libel in 'The Prioress's Tale'; Marlowe casts Barabas in The Jew of Malta as a pantomime international financier. Then there is the most famous Jew in literature, Shakespeare's 'dog Jew' Shylock. Marcus points out that Shylock's 'new and fantastic' views on Christians and interest make him the Bard of Avon's own imagined Jew. The reader is left feeling disconcerted by widespread versions of the imagined Jew, with ancient hatreds still being reinterpreted into modern ones.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType":

In every era, in different parts of the world, Jewish communities have faced persecution, discrimination, and violence. Around the world, since the Holocaust, diaspora Jewry continued to face persecution. From the persecution of Soviet Jewry to the Kielce Pogrom in Poland, from the AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires to the expulsion and persecution of nearly all the entire Jewish communities of the Middle East outside Israel, it never really went away.\n\nIn recent years, this hatred surged again in Europe, with Jews widely being afraid to wear a kippah or a Jewish star. But America always stood as a beacon of hope amidst the darkness of the diaspora.\n\nIn the words of the renowned late Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, America was a \"country of kindness.\" Despite the occasional attacks and bouts of antisemitism cropping up in America, from the Klu Klux Klan to Henry Ford to Charldes Lindbergh, America has always had a good relationship with its Jews.\n\nNo more. The current climate in America, post-Oct. 7, is a chilling echo of the past. Hate crimes against Jews have surged, and the sense of security that once existed is rapidly eroding. The rise of antisemitic rhetoric and actions are no longer confined to the fringes, but have permeated mainstream discourse.\n\nMany of the students and faculty at elite universities, America's staging ground for the future leaders in politics, industry, and thought, have expressed support for Hamas, a terrorist organization. In a recent poll of college students, 40 percent say they sympathize with Hamas, compared to only 33 percent who don't. Students call for the death of Jews, make them scared to be on their own campuses, and celebrate terrorism.\n\nI have friends at these universities, including the world-famous ones with billion-dollar endowments. They are scared to walk around on their own campuses, attacked by radicals who see a Jewish star and lash out. One friend had a flag violently taken from him, another was assaulted by several protesters, and others were harassed and made to fear for their safety.\n\nThis is not just happening on campuses, either. Swastikas have been spotted popping up outside of stores in New York, and an ever-growing group of online Neo-Nazis and antisemites harass Jewish people constantly.\n\nA kosher restaurant that I work in recently had its door shattered, one of two such incidents to occur in a single day. I have spent countless evenings in that restaurant, watching Jewish customers comfortably eating their dinners and enjoying time with family and friends. I have sat there myself, and walked through that very door hundreds of times without a care. Now that comfort and security that we took for granted are threatened. The door is shattered. Shades of Kristallnacht cannot but appear before our eyes.\n\nAnd, of course, this ideology has infiltrated the halls of Congress. From accusations of \"genocide\" because Israel wants to stop future Hamas massacres, to lies that Israel is an apartheid state or committing war crimes, members of the far-left have used their platforms to promote hate against Israel and Jews. And -- partly due to the indoctrination on campuses -- the numbers of those in power who call for the eradication of the Jewish state only continue to grow, as younger and more radical activists take their places as staffers, legislative aides, and Members of Congress.\n\nJews in America must continue to advocate for Israel and the Jewish community, but a glance at the age-segmented opinion polling shows that the future looks bleak. We must find a way to change the conversation, and interact with these future leaders in a way that can change their minds.\n\nA few years ago, I asked a prominent rabbi with knowledge of the topic how long he thought America would remain safe for Jews. He said it would be just 10 or 15 years. At the time, I thought that was pessimistic. I was wrong. America -- Di Goldene Medine (the Golden Land) -- has been tarnished at last. America is no longer safe for Jews.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews",

Jews came to the town in substantial numbers after Joseph Fahys opened a watchcase factory here in 1881. He recruited Jewish engravers from Hungary where engraving was a fine art among Jews. He or his representatives would go to Ellis Island and bring them straight to Sag Harbor.\n\nMy grandfather, Herman Grossman, came to Sag Harbor in 1902 to work at Fahys. He met Stefanie Spiegel, also a Hungarian Jew. Stefanie's sister, Ernestine, had married into the Spitz family, Hungarian Jews who owned Spitz's Furniture & Appliance Store on Main Street in Sag Harbor. Members of the family also worked at Fahys.\n\nTemple Adas Israel, which describes itself as the oldest synagogue on Long Island, was founded in 1896 as Temple Mishcan Israel. It changed its name in 1948 when it became Conservative after many years as an Orthodox congregation. My wife Janet and I are members of Adas Israel, where she was long a member and secretary of its board.\n\nIn the museum here, which Janet arranged, are the synagogue's original memorial plaques, on one of which is the name of my grandaunt Ernestine Spitz, who died in 1928. Now, a wrinkle in the Sag Harbor Jewish story for those who might be unfamiliar with it: the deep division for years between the Hungarian Jews and the Jews of Sag Harbor with roots in Russia and other European countries. I explore this divide at the start of a TV documentary I made as chief investigative reporter at WVVH-TV, The (Unusual) Jewish History of Sag Harbor, which can be viewed on YouTube.\n\nWhen Hungarian Jews began arriving in Sag Harbor to work at Fahys' watchcase factory, they didn't get along with other Jews already living in the town. In her well-researched work, Yankees in Yarmulkes: Small-Town Jewish Life in Eastern Long Island (1986), Helene Gerard, a librarian from Eastport, writes that in 1890 the Jewish Cemetery Association of Sag Harbor was formed \"with six trustees, all of them Russian Jews. This is significant,\" she goes on, because in Sag Harbor there were two distinct Jewish communities.\n\n\"The Jews from Russia and those from Hungary brought with them European social antagonisms and refused to worship, socialize or be buried together,\" Gerard explains.\n\nAnd so, the Hungarians formed their own Independent Jews Cemetery Association of Sag Harbor in 1899, right next to the Russian Jewish cemetery. \"A fence ... was erected between the two, which still exists,\" writes Gerard.\n\nIn the documentary, I comment, \"How dopey it was,\" that this division between Jews in Sag Harbor existed, especially because Jews weren't particularly welcome in neighboring East Hampton and Southampton.\n\nHungarian Jews might have thought themselves better than Russian and Polish Jews, but for the Nazis, there was no distinction -- they killed them all, including the families of Herman and Stefanie. On my mother's side in Poland, all were murdered, too.\n\nIn 1918, Gerard relates, \"the (Sag Harbor) Jewish community had financial difficulties, and the synagogue's mortgage was foreclosed. Three members of the congregation bought it back at public auction,\" and later that year a \"new certificate of incorporation was filed. From the names listed,\" she relates, it is clear that by then -- after two decades -- \"the Russian and Hungarian factions had finally made peace and joined in one congregation.\"\n\nThe division between the cemeteries still exists, but the descendants of the Hungarian and Polish Jews are divided no more. One cemetery is owned and run by Temple Adas Israel, and the other owned and run under an independent name.\n\nIn terms of Jewish numbers in Sag Harbor, Gerard cites a 1902 Sag Harbor Express article reporting \"a recent census indicating a total population of 3,438,\" then continues: \"Our population is cosmopolitan ... there are about 650 adults of foreign birth. ... The Hebrew invasion, which is comparatively recent, sums up, men, women and children, about 500.\"\n\nThus, nearly 15% of Sag Harbor's population early in the last century were Jews, which is remarkable.\n\nThe Sag Harbor Express story went on to note that when Jews arrived in the town from Ellis Island by steamer, they were greeted at the docks by townspeople crying, \"Jerusalem is coming! Jerusalem is here!\"\n\nIn East Hampton, southeast of Sag Harbor, no one was proclaiming, \"Jerusalem is here!\" There were very few Jews. Indeed, a 2009 story in The Southampton Press to mark the 50th anniversary of the Jewish Center of the Hamptons reported that as late as the 1950s, \"The East Hampton Jewish community consisted of perhaps 11 families, most of whom ran local businesses.\"\n\nIt was at East Hampton's exclusive Maidstone Club that Groucho Marx, after being told that while he could play golf there as a guest, he wouldn't be allowed to become a member because he was a Jew, famously commented, \"My kids are only half-Jewish. Can they play at least the front nine?\" (There are several versions of this story.)\n\nDeserving much credit for breaking the discriminatory floodgates in East Hampton was the late Evan Frankel, a scrappy, tough guy originally from the Lower East Side. I vividly recall Frankel telling me how he had become \"the sole Jew living south of Montauk Highway in East Hampton.\" And on an 11-acre estate, no less. South of Montauk Highway was, and remains, the most upscale part of the village.\n\nFrankel had come to the East End to build radar facilities during World War II. Steel was in short supply, and he devised a way to use wood to build the frames on which the radar equipment was perched.\n\nSome of the few Jews in East Hampton had come to him in the 1950s, he related, wanting \"to build a little shul.\" Frankel characteristically thought in a big way. He bought the stately Borden Estate on Montauk Highway, the main entrance to East Hampton village, and the four acres on which it sits. Frankel, to whom establishing Jewish presence in East Hampton was very important, said it showed that \"Jews had arrived\" in the town, and he donated the building and land for what became the Jewish Center of the Hamptons. He worked closely with another wealthy Jew, J.M. Kaplan, whose summer house in East Hampton is now the Center for Conservation of The Nature Conservancy.\n\nGreat architectural and spiritual splendor was to come to JCOH with a new sanctuary named Gates of the Grove. Frankel was central to getting Norman Jaffe, the renowned architect from Bridgehampton, to design it. Paul Goldberger, architecture writer for The New York Times and The New Yorker, has described Gates of the Grove as a \"truly sacred space,\" Jaffe's \"greatest work.\"\n\nIt is, indeed, a masterpiece.\n\nTo Sag Harbor's southwest, in Southampton, the Jewish population also had been small. But there's now also the Chabad of Southampton Jewish Center, which notes it is \"the first synagogue in historic Southampton since its 1640 founding ...\"\n\n\"You can imagine,\" related a story in New York Magazine, \"the consternation when ... a family arrived that clearly hadn't seen the membership brochure. The man ... had a bird's nest of a beard and wore dark suits all day long. He and his wife were young but had a bevy of children -- two at first, five before long. They invited guests on Saturday morning -- dozens of them.\" The reference is to Rabbi Rafe and Chany Konikov.\n\nThe story went on: \"Almost immediately, Southamptonites began whispering, 'Who are these people? What do they want? What do we do about them?' ... Soon enough complaints were registered. Letters were sent ... Finally the villagers did what Hamptonites have done before them in the face of unprecedented change: They sued.\"\n\nIt was quite a struggle for the Chabad.\n\nAn excellent book about what it was like to be a Jew in Southampton is Together But Apart: The Jewish Experience in the Hamptons. Published in 1966, it was written by Abe Frank, born \"when there were about 20 Jewish families in Southampton,\" he relates, and raised there, going on to graduate from Columbia Law School, becoming an attorney, and then an administrative law judge for the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring World War II, he was in the U.S. Army and was with the 120th Evacuation Hospital when it entered Buchenwald Concentration Camp after it was liberated in April 1945. He provides an eyewitness account of the horror in Together But Apart.\n\n\"Was there anti-Semitism in Southampton?\" Frank writes. \"Of course. It lurked in hidden corners of hostile minds, waiting to confront us, usually on unequal terms ... like a constant pressure on the nerves, a part of day-to-day living, and we put up with it, as an old man puts up with a ringing in the ears.\"\n\nFor Jews in Southampton, \"We had to accept there were people who did not like Jews, any Jews ... And there were times when the knife cut truly deep ... No way around it. In Southampton we were different from other people ... We had a sort of prescience as to who was anti-Semitic and who was not. People put out vibes, sometimes unintentionally, and our antennae were always quick to catch them. ...\" Frank continues, \"While there was obviously no welcome mat for Jews in Southampton, not everyone bore a grudge against the family of Israel and Rachel, and there were many who showed generosity and kindness to the Israelite in their midst.\"\n\nFor Temple Adas Israel in Sag Harbor, a major turning point came when Leon Morris, the last of several part-time rabbis, became its first full-time rabbi in 2010. In 2014, Rabbi Leon and his family made Aliyah, and he's now president of the Pardes Institute in Israel. He was succeeded by Rabbi Dan Geffen.\n\nAnother major turning point has been the restoration of the synagogue, a magnificent job that started in 2021. It originally was a vision of Rabbi Leon. Architect Lee Pomeroy drew up plans but, sadly, passed away and was succeeded by another superb architect, Bill Chaleff. Overseeing the project was contractor Roy \"Buddy\" Wines and his Southampton-based company RLW4. There were only minor changes in the footprint of the synagogue. The exquisite sanctuary has been left largely as it was. The stunning stained-glass windows fashioned by Sag Harbor artist Romany Kramoris, who used 10,000 pieces of glass, received vital protection. Most of the renovation involved digging out a basement, expanding other portions of the building and making such improvements as adding an elevator for the disabled and creating space for the Ronald S. Lauder Center for Jewish Learning.\n\nRonald and Jo Carole Lauder, who live in Wainscott, are members. He is president of the World Jewish Congress and former U.S. ambassador to Austria. His late mother, makeup queen Estee Lauder, was an Adas Israel member. The matching Lauder grant was crucial to the congregation being able to afford the $7.3 million project.\n\nThe congregation had homes away from home during the renovation, thanks to the big-heartedness of the First Presbyterian Church in Sag Harbor, known as the Old Whalers' Church, and the Cormaria Retreat Center. Services were held inside the church and also on its front lawn. And a string of services was held on the lawn of the Cormaria Retreat Center of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, a global Roman Catholic community.\n\nSag Harbor has a tradition of accepting others. There's now another synagogue in Sag Harbor, the Center for Jewish Life, a Chabad. The idea for the center emerged in 2013 in the living room of the home of Rabbi Berel Lerman and wife Brocha, in North Haven, and at the Sag Harbor Inn, and is now on Long Island Avenue and seeking a permanent home.\n\nIn 2013, The Jerusalem Post published a story headlined: \"The Jewish Hamptons.\" It began by telling how the Hamptons have \"attracted\" many Jews who have \"established thriving institutions.\"\n\nIn Riverhead there's the Conservative Temple Israel of Riverhead. Its first synagogue building opened in 1926. An extensive history of the shul online includes, among its many pages, these items:\n\n\"(In the) 1930s, Sam Saxtein inadvertently stocks the Peconic River with carp when he digs a trench to link his pond to the river. Prior to the trench, there were a healthy number of fresh pike (pickerel) and perch (whitefish) in the Peconic, but no carp, a necessary ingredient for gefilte fish. So, Sam puts in netting at the end of the trench to prevent his carp from escaping. The roe slips through the net. Thanks to Sam, there's carp swimming in the river today.\" (Who knew the Peconic River was a source for gefilte fish!)\n\n\"(In) 1937, Nazi youths march on the streets of Camp Siegfied in nearby Yaphank. The Scheinberg family is vigilant. They hide a cache of diamonds in their basement in the event the Nazis come into power and the family needs to flee.\"\n\nHere in Suffolk County, a concern by a family that it might need to flee to escape violent anti-Semitism is a concern shared by Jews throughout the world for ages.\n\nThere are now plenty of Jews on the East End, and the community is flourishing.\n\nIn the Town of Southampton, the top-elected official, the town supervisor, has been until this year -- he was term-limited -- Jay Schneiderman, whose family are members of Temple Adas Israel. His son Ruben was bar mitzvahed at the synagogue, and before that his daughter, Magda, was bat mitzvahed there. Schneiderman's late mom, also named Magda, left Hungary for the U.S. in 1938. \"Hitler wiped out the rest of her family,\" says Schneiderman.\n\nAnd in Southampton Village, Jesse Warren, a Jew, served as mayor between 2019 and 2023.\n\nA few blocks from the old Fahys' watchcase factory, now converted into an apartment complex, our son Adam went to elementary school, then to Pierson High School. Adam went on to law school, became Riverhead town attorney, and was a member and then chairman of the Southampton Town Zoning Board from 2002 to 2023 when he was appointed a Southampton Town justice. His great grandparents, Herman and Stefanie, would be so proud of Adam -- as we are.\n\nKarl Grossman is professor of journalism at the State University of New York at Old Westbury and host of the

But Jews?\n\n\"A tiny population influential beyond its numbers,\" is how Oxford historian Hugh Macmillan described this community, which at its postwar peak numbered no more than 1,200.\n\n\"Jews have played an important part in Zambian history, especially in commercial business but also in the country's political and intellectual life,\" said Macmillan, co-author of the 1999 book \"Zion in Africa: The Jews of Zambia.\"\n\nToday, there are almost no Jews living in Zambia, a nation of about 20 million in central Africa. But the influence of their historic presence is continuing to shape the developing nation, particularly as it builds up its medical infrastructure.\n\nEuropean Jews first came to the country in the late 19th century, when it was still known as Northern Rhodesia. Most were from Eastern Europe's \"Pale of Settlement\" -- poor Yiddish-speaking emigrants seeking a better life. They started off as peddlers, traders and shopkeepers. Over the next few decades, they diversified into farming, cattle ranching, timber and mining.\n\nIn the 1920s, about 100 Jews lived in the country, nearly half of them in Livingstone, then the capital city. The second wave of Jewish immigration occurred in the late 1930s, when some 300 Jews from Germany and Austria -- along with others from Latvia, Lithuania and the Greek island of Rhodes -- received visas from the British colonial regime. Many more, fleeing Nazi persecution, were denied entry.\n\nAs Zambia developed its copper mines in the north, the Jewish population swelled; communities began popping up in the \"Copperbelt\" towns of Kitwe, Ndola, Mufulira and the new capital, Lusaka. Each of these towns had its own synagogue, celebrated religious holidays and had a Jewish cemetery.\n\n\"We were a small but very cohesive community,\" said Aviva Ron, 81, who grew up in Ndola. Her father, Hanania Elkaim, came to Northern Rhodesia from pre-state Palestine and was in the construction business.\n\n\"We had services every Friday night. Bar mitzvahs were prepared by a ba'al tefilah and the mohel was the local dentist,\" added Ron, who moved to Israel in 1960, where she studied public health before becoming a senior official in the World Health Organization.\n\nIn the early 1960s, when Zambia remained a British colony, there were about 300 Jews living in the Copperbelt region. After independence in 1964, the country's new leader declared that only native Zambians could acquire work permits, forbidding foreigners to work in positions that Zambians could fill. Many Jews left.\n\nBy 2001, after decades of disease and war that plunged the region into poverty and disorder, the Jewish population in the region had dropped precipitously. Among those who remained were Dennis and Maureen Figov, shopkeepers who operated an auction house and general store that Dennis Figov's father opened in 1936.\n\n\"Zambia is my home. I have been here since I was two weeks old, and I love it here,\" Dennis Figov, who served a stint as mayor of Luanshya in the 1960s, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency at the time. He died in 2022 in Cape Town, South Africa, where the couple moved in retirement.\n\nAmong the most prominent Zambian Jews were brothers Elie and Harry Susman, who started out as cattle traders and later became major figures in transportation, retail and mining industries; economist Stanley Fischer, who became chairman of the Bank of Israel; and Ron's brother Michael A. Elkaim, a supreme court justice in Australia.\n\nUnlike the other white Zambians (mainly British colonials) or in neighboring South Africa, the Jews of Zambia had open and equitable relations with Africans, Ron said. \"We weren't like the South African Jews who had nannies and houseboys,\" she added. \"We weren't raised like that. When my father's Indian and Black workers came to the house, they waited in the living room, not the back steps. Their children were my friends.\"\n\nThere was antisemitism but mostly of a social kind, she explained. \"Jews were not admitted to the tennis or golf clubs, so my father built his own tennis court, where he played with an Indian friend.\"\n\nAccording to historian Macmillan, \"Jews and Africans were both the objects of differing degrees of racism. It was endemic among white settlers in southern Africa ... They were seen as occupying an intermediate space between 'whites' and 'Africans,'\" he writes in \"Zion in Africa.\" \"There was fear that Jews in the frontier might become too familiar with Africans and undermine the deference toward whites, which was seen as essential to their security.\"\n\nIndeed, many Jewish traders did connect directly with the tribal leaders in trade and commerce, bypassing the British colonial administrators.\n\nOne notable Jew, Simon Zukas, played a key role in Zambia's struggle for independence in the 1950s. For that, he was exiled by the colonial government. After independence, Zukas went on to become a government minister. On his death, in October 2021, age 96, the government declared a day of national mourning.\n\nToday, Zambia is home to only about 11 Jews, not counting those staying temporarily.\n\nThe Council of Zambian Jewry accumulated $2 million -- proceeds from the sale of community properties and investments. In 2014 it donated half to establish a medical school at the Copperbelt University in Ndola. The remainder went to Tel Aviv University School of Medicine, earmarked for collaboration with the Ndola university, including visits by health experts and student exchanges. The first building of the Zambian medical school is named after the Hebrew community.\n\n\"It was payback time,\" said Ron, whose career in public health drew her back yearly to Zambia, along with visiting her family. Together with the late community leader Michael Cecil Galaun, they were driving forces in establishing the medical collaboration.\n\nThe Livingstone museum was established with donations from David Susman, a descendant of the Jewish pioneers, and others from the community. Its panels and glass cases highlight the 130-year history of Zambian Jews, with text, photos, letters and Jewish ritual objects. Zambia's Ministry of Education includes Jewish heritage in its curriculum, with schools bringing students to the museum. Located on the grounds of the Railway Museum, it is administered by the city.\n\nWalking tours of \"Jewish Livingstone\" also can be arranged with a local historian and volunteer, Peter Jones.\n\nOverseeing the heritage and needs of Zambia's Jews -- as well as those in eight other southern African countries -- is Rabbi Moshe Silberhaft of the African Jewish Congress. Known as the \"traveling rabbi,\" the Johannesburg-based Silberhaft visits Zambia, bringing kosher products and matzah during Passover, officiating at lifecycle events like bar mitzvahs, weddings and funerals, and, crucially, making sure Jewish gravestones and cemeteries are maintained.\n\n\"Our mission is to respect and record the contributions of once-proud, vibrant Jewish communities in southern Africa,\" he said, noting that Jews lived in nearly 1,500 towns over a 130-year period. \"Many have streets with Jewish names of people who made positive contributions. We are here to support the few Jews that are left, and preserve the memory of those who once lived here.\"", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"},

Through a steady demonization of Jews, increasingly virulent measures were imposed on members of the Jewish community, which slowly whittled away at the rights that had been granted to Jews in the early days of the French Revolution.\n\nIn 1791, in a dramatic show of tolerance and a rejection of long-held prejudices, the French National Assembly declared that Jews were equal citizens of France with all the rights of other citizens of that nation. For the first time in modern European history, Jews proudly stood side by side with their non-Jewish neighbors as equals.\n\nDespite a roller-coaster ride of social prejudice over the course of 150 years, the issue of Jewish legal equality remained unquestioned until the Germans marched into France in 1940 and provided cover to those who had never fully accepted the notion of Jewish equality. Within weeks of the German conquest of France, the puppet government began to impose discriminatory legislation against Jews.\n\nThe measures began with a deprivation of citizenship for all foreign-born Jews who had attained that status after 1927. In the midst of war and occupation, many may have thought that it was best not to trust foreigners, especially German-born foreigners (many of whom, even though Jewish, may have been thought to harbor latent loyalties to their former country). Thus, the law was implemented without much objection, even by members of the old-line French Jewish community. The slide down a slippery slope had begun.\n\nSteadily, prohibitions piled on. Characterized as warmongers and profiteers, Jews became an easy target for those promoting blatantly antisemitic legislation. After having been forced to wear a yellow star on all outer garments to be more readily identifiable and therefore made to appear different, strange and threatening, Jews living in France were systematically excluded from virtually every aspect of ordinary life. By 1942, deportations had begun and gradually accelerated until by 1944, nearly 75,000 Jewish men, women and children had been murdered.\n\nFollowing the liberation of France by the Allied forces, all of the antisemitic legislation was repealed, and France returned to the cherished principles of the French Revolution with respect to its Jewish population. The horrors of the Holocaust and the complicity of France in that event seemed to have forever inoculated France against the disease of official antisemitism. Although ridding the population at large of this disease may not have seemed possible, making certain that the French government would not be a party to such reprehensible behavior seemed assured.\n\nIt was assured until last week.\n\nUnder cover of the new antisemitism -- opposition to Israel and its supporters -- the French government, acting through its Ministry of Defense, for the first time since its occupation during World War II, adopted a measure laced with antisemitism. It declared that Israeli companies (74 of which were registered to participate) were to be banned from attending Eurosatory, the world's largest trade show for defense and security contractors being held just outside of Paris, which began on June 17.\n\nA court order further declared that all representatives and agents of Israeli companies (including, of course, many French Jews) were also to be banned from attending the trade show. A sign was then allegedly posted on the front entrance warning Israelis that they were not welcome.\n\nWith its decision, the French government, heir to the enlightened principles of the French Revolution, openly, blatantly and unashamedly betrayed those principles, even though this betrayal is shrouded by rhetoric about the current conflict in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBased on Israel's alleged \"war crime\" of defending itself against terrorists and of seeking to eliminate a vicious enemy that uses its own people as human shields, French President Emmanuel Macron's government used the outrageous and egregiously false excuse that Israelis may be committing genocide to ban all Israeli manufacturers from Eurosatory and effectively also banned anyone who could be considered to be assisting them -- read: any Jew.\n\nFortunately, on June 18, the Paris Commercial Court declared that the government's action was discriminatory and reversed it. This was an important decision, but it was handed down too late to permit Israeli companies to set up and participate in the trade show. The antisemites had their victory.\n\nThe government's action of isolating and demonizing Jews (albeit now under cover of the term \"Israelis\") echoes the worst that France has wrought over the last 200 years. It accentuates the old antisemitic trope that Jews are evil and that they are outsiders, as repeatedly depicted by enemies of the Jews, whether for political, economic or religious reasons.\n\nFrance is a far better nation than this. Its leaders should be embarrassed and ashamed of having undermined some of France's greatest qualities based on Enlightenment principles of tolerance, societal solidarity and justice. The Macron government's decision to isolate and banish Israelis and those who assist them (Jews, of course) from an important event in French commercial life is a profoundly disturbing and destructive event.\n\nHopefully, as French citizens head to the polls in the next few weeks to participate in the election of a new National Assembly, they will take into account the antisemitic policy adopted by the current government and will express their rejection of those who have supported this policy.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors":

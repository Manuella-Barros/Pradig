Indeed, while Southgate prepares for what could be his final tournament in charge of the men's senior side at UEFA Euro 2024, Harry Redknapp, Frank Lampard and David Seaman will be be hoping their squad of celebrity misfits and retired sports personalities can do a job at Chelsea's Premier League stadium. That's right, Soccer Aid is back, and the one-night only charity match - launched by pop star Robbie Williams and his close friend Jonathan Wilkes in 2006 - will serve as the perfect pre-tournament appetizer when it gets underway on June 9. The year, presenter Paddy McGuinness, actors Danny Dyer and Tom Hiddleston, singer Tom Grennan and comedian Alex Brooker are included in an England squad that also features retired footballers Gary Cahill, Jack Wilshere, David James and Theo Walcott. Stuart Broad, Sam Quek and Mo Farah swap disciplines to football, having previously been elite athletes in cricket, hockey and long-distance running respectively. Simon Minter from the Sidemen, entrepreneur Steven Bartlett, TV personality Sam Thompson, and boxing promoter Eddie Hearn also feature. But despite their wealth of experience, Brooker believes the key to winning back the Soccer Aid trophy after six consecutive defeats trophy lies elsewhere. Speaking to virginradio.co.uk, The Last Leg star assessed England's chances of winning the contest for the first time since 2018 - and pinpointed teammate Bobby Brazier as their 'secret weapon.' 'I bet you [Bobby Brazier] is a really good player,' he said. 'Straight up I have never seen him play football before, [but] I bet you he\u2019s a really good footballer. 'I think he\u2019s also fit - the geezer\u2019s done Strictly! He\u2019s physically fit, which is a big bonus when you have people like me alongside you - I need someone to do the running! So yeah, I think Bobby will be amazing.' England will face a World XI managed for the second consecutive year by ex-Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino - who faces an awkward return to Stamford Bridge just weeks after his unexpected sacking. Pochettino's one-year reign as manager was ended when the Blues announced a 'mutual agreement' to relieve him of his duties halfway through his two-year contract. Speaking in a statement after he was relieved of his duties, Pochettino said: 'Thank you to the Chelsea ownership group and sporting directors for the opportunity. 'The club is now well positioned to keep moving forward in the Premier League and Europe in the years to come.' Fortunately, the Argentinian has been assigned a rather less bloated squad than the one he inherited at Chelsea, with Jamaican athlete Usain Bolt joining presenter Roman Kemp, retired boxer Tony Bellew, and Tommy Fury among this year's competing celebrities. They will join international sporting legends including former Chelsea stars Eden Hazard, Petr \u010cech, Michael Essien and Mikel John Obi when the match gets underway. 'It just kind of blows my mind,' said Alex of the game's popularity. 'It\u2019s an incredible event for such an amazing cause\u2026 So please come out and support us. 'It\u2019s going to be an amazing game, an amazing show, and the cause is the best. Hopefully this year we can take the money raised through Soccer Aid past that \u00a3100 million mark.", "summary": "Long-suffering Three Lions fans might have something to cheer on Sunday when England face the old enemy at Stamford Bridge - and Gareth Southgate will be nowhere in sight.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13497749/Alex-Brooker-reveals-player-Englands-secret-weapon-prepare-rest-world-Soccer-Aid-2024.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/05/16/85750295-0-image-m-131_1717601919679.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/06/09/650398341469913856/1024x576_MP4_650398341469913856.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:55:34", "author": "Editor,Jason Chester", "authors": ["Editor", "Jason Chester"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.3}

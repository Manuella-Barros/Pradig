The share of Muslim population in 1950 was 9.84 percent and increased to 14.09 percent in 2015 -- a 43.15 percent increase in their share,\" says the working paper, Share of Religious Minorities: A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015), authored by Shamika Ravi, Apurv Kumar Mishra and Abraham Jose.\n\nThe paper also throws light on the global trend in share of religious minorities and majorities in 167 countries over a period of 65 years.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, it says, all the Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except Maldives where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 percent.\n\nAs opposed to the scenario in India, the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have \"shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan\".\n\nIndia, the paper says, provides a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society and the outcome of the \"progressive policies and inclusive institutions\" are reflected in the growing number of minority populations. It says that political changes are mere symptoms of deeper structural changes that are happening in societies due to a variety of transformations, of which demographic evolution is an important component.\n\n\"Contrary to the noise in several quarters, careful analysis of the data shows that minorities are not just protected but indeed thriving in India. This is particularly remarkable given the wider context within the South Asian neighborhood, where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan,\" it says, referring to the situation in India.\n\nGlobally, the share of the majority population has decreased in 123 countries while it went up in 44 countries only, according to the paper.\n\nThe share of the majority religious denomination globally has gone down by approximately 22 percent. \"On every major continent, more countries have seen a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination than increase,\" it says.\n\nReferring to the global trends on increase and decrease in the share of the majority religious population, the authors said, \"Our hypothesis is that the change in the proportion of the minority population as a share of total population is a good proxy for the status of minorities in a country over time. A society which provides a congenial environment for the flourishing of minorities is more likely to witness an increase or stabilization in their numbers over a period of three generations.\"\n\nAlso Read: Only half of India's working-age population works, most still in agriculture, shows ILO report\n\nOf the eight member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and Myanmar, the share of the majority religious denomination has decreased in four while it increased in five. The Indian subcontinent accounts for one-fifth of the global population.\n\nIn the 65-year period (1950 to 2015), there has been an increase in the share of Muslim population in Muslim majority countries, except Maldives, and many of the Hindu majority countries have witnessed a decline in majority religious population, the paper says.\n\n\"Among the five non-Muslim majority countries, Myanmar, India and Nepal saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination while Sri Lanka and Bhutan saw their share increase,\" it says.\n\n\"Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 percent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 percent increase in the share of total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971,\" it mentions.\n\n\"In Bangladesh, there was an 18 percent increase in the share of the majority religious group, which is the largest such increase in the Indian subcontinent.\"\n\nSimilarly, the share of Muslim population rose from 99.4 percent to 99.7 percent in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile India witnessed a decline of 7.8 percent in the share of Hindu population, other non-Muslim majority countries also saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination.\n\nFor instance, the share of Theravada Buddhist population declined by 10 percent -- the steepest decline of the majority religious group in the region -- during the study period in Myanmar.\n\nThe same holds true for Nepal where the majority Hindu population declined by 4 percent, and so did the share of Buddhist population by 3 percent. But \"Muslim population increased by 2 percent,\" the authors say.\n\n\"Only Sri Lanka and Bhutan among non-Muslim majority countries have witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015\"\n\n\"It is not surprising, therefore, that minority populations from across the neighborhood come to India during times of duress,\" the paper says, referring to these trends.\n\nIn 2019, the Modi government brought the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act to facilitate citizenship to undocumented people belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Christian and Jain communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The rules for its implementation were notified by the Union home ministry last month.\n\nReferring to the conducive environment to foster diversity in the society in India, the authors mention how persecuted populations from several countries have made India their home over the last six decades.\n\nGlobally, a majority of countries witness decline in majority religious groups. Of the 167 countries, the share of the majority religious group decreased in 123 while it increased in 44.\n\n\"Our analysis shows that the world has become more heterogeneous in the previous six decades,\" the paper says.\n\nIn a post on 'X', formerly Twitter, Shamika Ravi said, \"In 1950, Animism had a majority status in 24 countries (almost all of them in Africa). Animism did not just lose its share in the overall population but it is no longer a majority population in any of these 24 countries by 2015.\"\n\nThe religion associated with the majority group in a country plays an important role in countries which have seen extreme changes, the authors note.\n\nAnalysing the data in these countries, the EAC-PM working paper says 20 countries that have seen the maximum increase in the share of the majority religious group are those where Christianity- or Islam-based denominations are the majority religious group.\n\n\"If we focus on the 20 countries that have seen the maximum decline in the share of the majority religious group, only 3 of them had Christianity or Islam based denominations as the majority religious group,\" it said.\n\nAs per the analysis of majority religion in countries, 77 out of the 94 countries that reported being Christian majority have witnessed a decrease in the share of the majority religious group since 1950. \"On the other hand, 25 out of the 38 countries that reported being Muslim majority in 1950 have seen an increase in share of the majority religious group while their share of the population has declined in only 13 countries,\" it says.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "risha_chitlangia@theprint.in", "name": "Risha Chitlangia", "type":

This suggests an environment fostering diversity. The Christian population increased by 5.38%, the Sikh population by 6.58%, and the Parsi population declined by 85%. The decline in the majority population and increase in minorities indicate a positive environment for societal diversity. Globally, there has been an average 22% decrease in the majority religious denomination's share.\n\nThe share of Hindus in total population of the country has decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015, while that of Muslims increased by 43.15 per cent, suggesting that there is a conducive environment to foster diversity, said a recent working paper by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM).\n\nIt, however, did not give absolute numbers. The last census in the country was done in 2011, and the one due in 2021 has not been conducted. It was also not clear how the EAC-PM arrived at the 2015 numbers.\n\nThe paper titled 'Share of Religious Minorities: A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)' further said the share of Jains in the population of India decreased from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015.\n\n''...

Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nAccording to the report, among non-Muslim majority countries, Myanmar, India and Nepal saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination.\n\nThe paper noted that the year 1950 is important as a baseline year for two major reasons.\n\nThis was around the time that the international human rights framework under the aegis of the newly created United Nations began to take shape with minority rights and state responsibility for the protection of minorities being mainstreamed in international law, the paper said.\n\nThe paper is a detailed cross-country descriptive analysis of the status of minorities around the world measured in terms of their changing share in a country's population over 65 years between 1950 and 2015.\n\nFor the 167 countries analysed, the average value for the share of the majority religious denomination in the baseline year of 1950 is 75 per cent, while the mean of the distribution capturing the change in majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015 is (minus) 21.9. The paper said that 21 out of the 40 countries that experienced extreme changes in population matrix are from Africa. Furthermore, 35 high-income OECD countries witnessed an average 29 per cent decline in the share of the majority religion, which is significantly higher than the global average.\n\n''This means that globally, the share of the majority religious denomination has gone down by approximately 22 per cent.

It has been co-authored by Shamika Ravi, Abraham Jose, and Apurv Kumar Mishra. It assessed the global trends of the demographic shift in 167 countries where a religious denomination/group was in the \"majority\".\n\nBetween 1950 and 2015, the population of Hindus in India declined sharply by 7.8% while Muslims grew by 43.15%, Christians by 5.38%, and Sikhs by 6.58%, as revealed by a recent report submitted by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi (EAC-PM). However, the population of Jain and Parsi communities in the population mix has decreased in the last 65 years which is equivalent to three generations.\n\nThe study titled, Share of Religious Minorities - A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015) was released in May 2024. It has been co-authored by Shamika Ravi, Abraham Jose, and Apurv Kumar Mishra. It assessed the global trends of the demographic shift in 167 countries where a religious denomination/group was in the \"majority\".\n\nAccording to the study, the share of Hindus in India's population saw a decrease from 84% in 1950 to 78% in 2015, while that of Muslims witnessed an increase from 9.84% to 14.09% in the same period.\n\nContrasting India's demographic shift with our neighbourhood\n\nWhile India's performance is \"consistent with the larger global trends\", the country's population growth story is starkly different from nations in its immediate neighbourhood. As stated above, Hindus, the majority community in India, registered a decline of 7.8% between 1950 and 2015.\n\nHowever, in neighbouring countries where Muslims (or their sect) constitute more than 50% - a majority, the community's share witnessed an increase in the demographic mix. Bangladesh saw the steepest increase of 18.5%, followed by Pakistan (3.75%) and Afghanistan (0.29%).\n\nAccording to the study, Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75% in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10% increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971. Pertinent to note that while Muslims' share increased by 10%, the study registers the rise of Pakistan's majority as 3.75% as Hanafi Muslims constitute the majority ID in Pakistan, as per the study.\n\nHowever, Hindus' decline by 7.8% in India is the second most significant decline in the immediate neighbourhood, just after Myanmar's 10%. Myanmar saw the highest decline in the majority community's share in the overall population of the country.\n\nIn Myanmar, the majority population of Theravada Buddhists declined by 10% in 65 years. According to the study, just like India, Nepal's majority community (Hindus) saw a 3.6% decline in its share of the country's population.\n\nIndia's neighbours with a majority Buddhist population, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, also saw an increase of 17.6% and 5.25%, respectively. However, in the Maldives, the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47%, as per the study by PM's EAC.\n\nAn increase in minority population reveals an overall favourable environment for 'minority' in that particular country: Study by PM-EAC lauds India's track record on safeguarding minorities\n\nAccording to the study, a reducing majority i.e. a negative rate of change in the share of the majority population (and an increase in the share of the minority population) from 1950-2015 means that it can be safely concluded that there exists an overall favourable environment for increasing diversity in the country.\n\nThe study noted, \"Contrary to the noise in several quarters, careful analysis of the data shows that minorities are not just protected, but indeed thriving in India. Contrary to the noise in several quarters, 28 careful analyses of the data show that minorities are not just protected but indeed thriving in India. This is particularly remarkable given the wider context within the South Asian neighbourhood where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe study further stated that a decrease in the share of the majority population and a consequent increase in the share of minorities suggests that the net result of all policy actions, political decisions, and societal processes is to provide a conducive environment for increasing diversity in society. It added that India's trend suggests \"there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society\".\n\nThe study asserts the outcomes of these progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the growing number of minority populations within India.\n\nThe study lauds India for being one of the few countries that has legally defined and provided protection to the \"minorities\".\n\nIt stated, \"By way of illustration, India is one of the few countries that has a legal definition of minorities and provides constitutionally protected rights for them. The outcomes of these progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the growing number of minority populations within India.\"\n\nHighlighting the same, it explains the reason why India has been the favoured nation in our neighboured as persecuted minorities find shelter in India and run towards India during times of duress.\n\nIt emphasises, \"It is not surprising, therefore, that minority populations from across the neighbourhood come to India during times of duress. India has been a nourishing environment for the Tibetian Buddhists who had to escape from China and have found a comfortable home in India in the last six decades. Similarly, Matuas who took refuge in India due to religious persecution in Bangladesh have been assimilated into Indian society. India also hosts a significant population of refugees from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Myanmar and Afghanistan. Given its plural, liberal and democratic nature, India has continued its civilizational tradition of harbouring persecuted populations from several countries over the last six decades.\"\n\nGlobal Trend in Demographic Shift\n\nAccording to the study, India's population growth story or demographic shift is \"consistent with the larger global trends\". As per the study, the world has become more heterogeneous in the previous six decades. In 1950, the share of the majority population in society was 75 per cent. However, the share of the majority religion in countries around the world has reduced by 22 per cent from 1950 to 2015.\n\nAs per the study, 123 countries experienced a decrease in the share of the majority religious group while its share increased in 44 countries. The change varies from a 99% decrease in Liberia to an 80% increase in Namibia.\n\nThe above table points out that sixteen different subcategories of Christianity are a majority in at least one country. Similarly, eight subcategories of Islam and three denominations of Buddhism constitute the majority population in at least one country.\n\nIn 1950, Animism, according to the RCS-Dem Dataset, was the predominant religion in 24 countries. However, by 2015, it no longer held the majority status in any of them. Among the 94 countries where Christianity was the majority religion in 1950, 77 experienced a decrease in its share in the overall population mix. Contrarily, during the same period, 25 out of the 38 countries with a Muslim majority saw an increase in the share of their majority religion. Interestingly, there are only two countries where Hindus constitute the majority, and in both cases, their share of the population has declined over the past 65 years.\n\nIn most continents, more countries saw a decrease in the share of the main religion group than an increase. Africa had the most extreme demographic shift, with 21 out of 40 countries experiencing significant shifts. Among 35 high-income OECD nations, the decline in the main religion's dominance was higher at 29%, compared to the global average of 22%.\n\nPossible reasons for demographic shift\n\nThe study points out that the change in the religious composition of a population is a complex phenomenon because several factors contribute to it, such as migration, conversion, differences in fertility rates, and variation in territorial boundaries as a result of political processes.\n\nHowever, it categorically notes that it has not refrained from commenting on reasons for this shift as it has multiple variables but focuses on the share of the minority population as a cumulative outcome measure of their well-being.\n\nSource for the data and Methodology\n\nOne major reason that academic study on the relationship between religion and outcomes within and between states has been relatively neglected is the lack of credible, granular, and timely datasets on religious demographics for countries around the world, the study notes explain the need for such an elaborate study about the changing demographic shift across the globe with a well-defined categorisation of the majority community.\n\nThe study, conducted by PM-EAC, relies on demographic data from the RCS-Dem dataset by ARDA, published in 2019. It asserts that RCS-Dem provides more comprehensive and consistent religious demographic data compared to other sources like WRD, WRP, and Pew Research Center's Religious Landscape Studies. RCS-Dem records population numbers for 97 religious denominations from the early 1800s onwards.\n\nThe study focuses on the rate of change of the majority community's share in a country's population due to the absence of an internationally accepted definition of \"minority\" or \"religious minority.\" It defines a majority community as a religion or denomination comprising over 50% of a country's total population in 1950, with subsects identified as the majority if they exceed 50%.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The share of Muslim population in 1950 was 9.84 per cent and increased to 14.09 per cent in 2015 -- a 43.15 per cent increase in their share,\" said the paper prepared by a team led by Shamika Ravi, member, EAC-PM.\n\nAccording to the paper, the share of Christian population rose from 2.24 per cent to 2.36 per cent -- an increase of 5.38 per cent between 1950 and 2015.\n\nWhile the share of Sikh population increased from 1.24 per cent in 1950 to 1.85 per cent in 2015 - a 6.58 per cent rise in their share, the share of the Parsi population in India witnessed a stark 85 per cent decline, reducing from 0.03 per cent share in 1950 to 0.004 per cent in 2015.\n\nThe data indicates that \"there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society,\" the paper said, adding that it is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach.\n\nThe paper noted that a decrease in the share of the majority population and a consequent increase in the share of minorities suggests that the net result of all policy actions, political decisions and societal processes is to provide a conducive environment for increasing diversity in society.\n\nThe report pointed out that in keeping with the global trends of declining majority, India too has witnessed a reduction in the share of the majority religious denomination by 7.82 per cent.\n\n\"This is particularly remarkable given the wider context within the South Asian neighborhood where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan,\" the paper said.\n\nThe paper said it is not surprising, therefore, minority populations from across the neighborhood come to India during times of duress.\n\nIt pointed out that all the Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except Maldives, where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 per cent.\n\nIn Bangladesh, there was an 18 per cent increase in the share of the majority religious group which is the largest such increase in the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nAccording to the report, among non-Muslim majority countries, Myanmar, India and Nepal saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination.\n\nThe paper noted that the year 1950 is important as a baseline year for two major reasons.\n\nThis was around the time that the international human rights framework under the aegis of the newly created United Nations began to take shape with minority rights and state responsibility for protection of minorities being mainstreamed in international law, the paper said.\n\nThe paper is a detailed cross-country descriptive analysis of the status of minorities around the world measured in terms of their changing share in a country's population over 65 years between 1950 and 2015.\n\nFor the 167 countries analysed, the average value for the share of the majority religious denomination in the baseline year of 1950 is 75 per cent, while the mean of the distribution capturing the change in majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015 is 21.9.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On the Indian subcontinent, the researchers found that all Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except the Maldives where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 per cent. In Bangladesh, there was an 18 per cent increase in the share of the majority religious group, which is the largest such increase in the Indian subcontinent.

Myanmar witnessed the steepest decline of the majority religious group in the region with the share of Theravada Buddhist population declining by 10 per cent in the period under study.\n\nThe study says that of the three major religions in Nepal, the share of the majority Hindu population declined by 4 per cent, the share of the Buddhist population declined by 3 per cent while the Muslim population increased by 2 per cent.\n\nOnly Sri Lanka and Bhutan among non-Muslim majority countries have witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the share of the majority Theravada Buddhist population increased by 5 per cent while the share of the Hindu population (the next largest religious group) declined by 5 per cent.

year\n\nThe paper noted that the year 1950 is important as a baseline year for two major reasons.\n\nThis was around the time that the international human rights framework under the aegis of the newly created United Nations began to take shape with minority rights and state responsibility for protection of minorities being mainstreamed in international law, the paper said.\n\nThe paper is a detailed cross-country descriptive analysis of the status of minorities around the world measured in terms of their changing share in a country's population over 65 years between 1950 and 2015.\n\nFor the 167 countries analysed, the average value for the share of the majority religious denomination in the baseline year of 1950 is 75 per cent, while the mean of the distribution capturing the change in majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015 is 21.9.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 9, 2024", "source": {"uri":

Even the share of the Buddhist population witnessed a noticeable increase from 0.05 per cent in 1950 to 0.81 per cent in 2015.\n\nOn the other hand, the share of Jains in the population of India decreased from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015. The share of the Parsi population in India too witnessed a 85 per cent decline, going down from 0.03 per cent share in 1950 to 0.004 per cent in 2015.\n\n\"Our analysis shows that the world has become more heterogeneous in the previous six decades. In 1950, the starting point for our study, the share of the majority population in a society was 75 per cent. The share of majority religion in countries around the world has reduced by 22 per cent from 1950 to 2015,\" the study said.\n\nWhile in every continent, more countries witnessed a decrease in the share of the majority religious group than an increase, Africa was subject to the most extreme swings - 21 out of the 40 countries which witnessed extreme changes are in the continent, the study said.\n\nFurther, the 35 high-income OECD countries in the study witnessed a 29 per cent decrease in the share of the majority religious denomination which is notably higher than the 22 per cent reduction globally, the study said.\n\nIndia's performance is consistent with larger global trends, the study said. Within its immediate neighbourhood in South Asia, India has witnessed the biggest decline in the majority population (7.82 per cent), only next to Myanmar which has witnessed a 10 per cent decline in its majority population over 65 years.\n\nOn the other hand, the share of the minorities as a composite group has increased significantly. \"Contrary to the noise in several quarters, careful analysis of the data shows that minorities are not just protected but indeed thriving in India,\" the EAC-PM study said.\n\n\"This is particularly remarkable given the wider context within the South Asian neighbourhood where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan,\" the study said.\n\nIndia's performance suggests that there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society, the report said. It is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach, the report said.\n\n\"By way of illustration, India is one of the few countries which has a legal definition of minorities and provides constitutionally protected rights for them. The outcomes of these progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the growing number of minority populations within India,\" the study said.\n\nThe study has observed that \"it is not surprising, therefore, that minority populations from across the neighbourhood come to India during times of duress. India has been a nourishing environment for the Tibetian Buddhists who had to escape from China and have found a comfortable home in India in the last six decades.\"\n\nSimilarly, Matuas who took refuge in India due to religious persecution in Bangladesh have been assimilated into the Indian society. India also hosts a significant population of refugees from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Myanmar and Afghanistan. Given its plural, liberal and democratic nature, India has continued its civilizational tradition of harbouring persecuted populations from several countries over the last six decades, the study said.\n\nIndia's performance in reduction of its majority population of Hindus is remarkable, considering the wider context of the South Asian neighbourhood where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan, the study said.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, the Working Paper said all Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except Maldives where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 per cent.\n\nIn Bangladesh, there was an 18 per cent increase in the share of the majority religious group which is the largest such increase in the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nThe EAC-PM study has not gone into the causes of the population changes but believed the nature and extent of change in the share of the minority population in a country is a strong indicator of its relative wellbeing within a country.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to the released report, the proportion of Muslims has increased in 38 Muslim-majority nations. \"On the Indian subcontinent, all the Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except the Maldives where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 percent,\" it said.\n\nIn Bangladesh, there was a significant 18% increase in the share of the majority religious group, marking the largest such rise in the Indian subcontinent. Meanwhile, Pakistan experienced a 3.75% increase in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a notable 10% increase in the share of the total Muslim population, despite the partition and creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nIn 1950, Muslims comprised 77.45% of the population in Pakistan. Currently, Muslims in the neighboring country constitute 80.36%. \"Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 percent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 percent increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971,\" it said.\n\nDuring the same period, the Muslim population in Bangladesh has surged from 74.24% to 88.02% of the total population. Similarly, in Afghanistan, the Muslim population has risen from 88.75% to 89.01%. However, in the Maldives, there has been a slight decrease in the Muslim population, from 99.83% to 98.36%.\n\nAccording to the report, the population of Buddhists in Myanmar has declined from 78.53% to 70.80%, while in Sri Lanka, it has increased from 64.28% to 67.65%. Meanwhile, in Bhutan, the Buddhist population has risen from 71.44% to 84.07%. Conversely, in Nepal, the Hindu population has decreased from 84.30% to 81.26%.\n\nAccording to the paper, the share of the majority population has decreased in 123 countries globally, while it has increased in only 44 countries. The share of the majority religious denomination has decreased globally by approximately 22 percent. \"On every major continent, more countries have seen a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination than an increase,\" it says.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus",

This trend of decline in the majority population has also been seen in Nepal and Myanmar. However, 38 Islamic countries have seen an increase in the population of Muslims.\n\nAccording to the study, except for Parsis and Jains, the proportion of all other religious minorities, including Christians, Buddhists, and Sikhs, in India experienced an increase in their population share, reaching up to 6.58 per cent during this period.\n\nThe share of Hindus in India's population saw a decrease from 84.68 per cent in 1950 to 78.06 per cent in 2015, while that of Muslims witnessed an increase from 9.84 per cent to 14.09 per cent in the same period, according to the EAC-PM study.\n\n\"In India, the share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 (from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent).

The share of the Christian population rose from 2.24 per cent in 1950 to 2.36 per cent in 2015 (an increase of 5.38 per cent), the share of the population went up from 1.24 per cent to 1.85 per cent (a 6.58 percent point rise) for the Sikhs.

According to the report released, the share of Muslims has increased in 38 Muslim-majority countries. \"On the Indian subcontinent, all the Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except Maldives where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 per cent,\" it said.\n\nIn Bangladesh, there was an 18 per cent increase in the share of the majority religious group which is the largest such increase in the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nIn 1950, Muslims accounted for 77.45 per cent of the population in Pakistan. Presently, Muslims in the neighboring country constitute 80.36 per cent. \"Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971,\" it said.\n\nOver the same period, Muslims in Bangladesh have increased from 74.24 per cent to 88.02 per cent of the population. Similarly, the Muslim population in Afghanistan has risen from 88.75 per cent to 89.01 per cent. However, in the Maldives, there has been a slight decline in the Muslim population, from 99.83 per cent to 98.36 per cent.\n\nAs per the report, the population of Buddhists in Myanmar has decreased from 78.53 per cent to 70.80 per cent, the population of Buddhists in Sri Lanka has increased from 64.28 per cent to 67.65 per cent and the population of Buddhists in Bhutan has increased from 71.44 per cent to 84.07 per cent. However, on the other hand, in Nepal, the population of Hindus has decreased from 84.30 per cent to 81.26 per cent.\n\nGlobally, the share of the majority population has decreased in 123 countries while it went up in 44 countries only, according to the paper. The share of the majority religious denomination globally has gone down by approximately 22 percent. \"On every major continent, more countries have seen a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination than increase,\" it says.\n\nReferring to the global trends on increase and decrease in the share of the majority religious population, the authors said, \"Our hypothesis is that the change in the proportion of the minority population as a share of total population is a good proxy for the status of minorities in a country over time. A society which provides a congenial environment for the flourishing of minorities is more likely to witness an increase or stabilization in their numbers over a period of three generations.\"\n\nAlso

Outcomes of progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the rising minority populations\n\nAmid an ongoing debate over the status of the Muslim population in India, the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister has published a study this year - with an analysis of global datasets and scenario - that states that minorities are not \"just protected but thriving in India\".\n\nAccording to the paper, titled Share of religious minority - A cross country analysis (1950-2015), \"Contrary to the noise in several quarters, a careful analysis of the data shows that minorities are not just protected but indeed thriving in India. This is particularly remarkable given the wider context within the South Asian neighbourhood where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan. India's performance suggests that there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society.\"\n\nThe Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) is an independent body, which advises the prime minister and the government on economic and related issues. Council member Dr Shamika Ravi and two others - Abraham Jose, a young professional, and Apurv Kumar Mishra, a consultant - have done the analysis and written the paper, which was accessed by News18.\n\nThe paper analyses global and country-specific data. It said: \"It is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach. By way of illustration, India is one of the few countries that has a legal definition of minorities and provides constitutionally protected rights for them. The outcomes of these progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the growing number of minority populations within India.\"\n\nThe study explains that the Muslim population in India has increased while the percentage of Hindus has dropped over the decades. \"In India, the share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 (from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent). The share of Muslim population in 1950 was 9.84 per cent and increased to 14.09 per cent in 2015 - a 43.15 per cent increase in their share,\" the paper said.\n\n\"The share of Christian population rose from 2.24 per cent to 2.36 per cent - an increase of 5.38 per cent between 1950 and 2015. The share of Sikh population increased from 1.24 per cent in 1950 to 1.85 per cent in 2015 - a 6.58 per cent rise in their share. Even the share of the Buddhist population witnessed a noticeable increase from 0.05 per cent in 1950 to 0.81 per cent,\" it added.\n\nThe researchers, meanwhile, also found out that the share of Jains decreased from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015. The Parsi population has also witnessed a stark 85 per cent decline, reducing from 0.03 per cent in 1950 to 0.004 per cent in 2015.\n\nThe paper further showed how Muslims in India have flourished. Minority populations from across neighbouring nations have also come to India when in trouble, it said.\n\n\"It is not surprising, therefore, that minority populations from across the neighborhood come to India during times of duress. India has been a nourishing environment for the Tibetian Buddhists who had to escape from China and have found a comfortable home in India in the last six decades,\" the paper said.\n\n\"Similarly, Matuas who took refuge in India due to religious persecution in Bangladesh have been assimilated into Indian society. India also hosts a significant population of refugees from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Myanmar and Afghanistan. Given its plural, liberal and democratic nature, India has continued its civilisational tradition of harbouring persecuted populations from several countries over the last six decades,\" it added.\n\nThe paper delved deep into factors related to the global economy and demographic transitions. Explaining the global scenario, it said: \"The global economy is in a phase of churn and being closely watched and analysed by economists and policymakers everywhere. There are, however, major demographic transitions that are also underway across countries - but mostly going unnoticed by analysts ranging from economy-watchers to democracy-watchers. These silent transformations have the power to reshape societies and states. Ironically, of the four megatrends whose cascading effects are bringing about these transformations - demography, technology, economy and climate change - the forecasts for demography are the most predictable.\"\n\n\"Shifting demographic trends are aggravating economic disparity within and between countries, straining governance and fuelling friction between states and people. Political changes are mere symptoms of deeper structural changes that are happening in societies due to a variety of transformations, of which demographic evolution is an important component. The composition of populations in countries around the world is changing along several axes that are well-documented such as age, urbanisation and migration levels,\" the paper said.\n\nAccording to the analysis of multiple datasets by the committee, the share of the majority religious denomination has decreased in four countries while its share has increased in five countries.\n\n\"All the Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except the Maldives, where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 per cent,\" said the document.\n\n\"Among the five non-Muslim majority countries, Myanmar, India and Nepal saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination while Sri Lanka and Bhutan saw their share increase. The members of SAARC are India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives. The range of the rate change in the share of the majority religion for this region spans from -9.84 per cent for Myanmar (where the share of Theravada Buddhist population fell from 79 to 71 per cent) to 18.55 per cent for Bangladesh (where the Hanafi Muslim witnessed an extraordinary rise from 74 to 88 per cent of the population),\" it added.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news",

The last census in the country was done in 2011, and the one due in 2021 has not been conducted. It was also not clear how the EAC-PM arrived at the 2015 numbers.\n\nThe paper titled 'Share of Religious Minorities: A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)' further said the share of Jains in the population of India decreased from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015.\n\n\"...

Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nAccording to the report, among non-Muslim majority countries, Myanmar, India and Nepal saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination.\n\nThe paper noted that the year 1950 is important as a baseline year for two major reasons.\n\nThis was around the time that the international human rights framework under the aegis of the newly created United Nations began to take shape with minority rights and state responsibility for the protection of minorities being mainstreamed in international law, the paper said.\n\nThe paper is a detailed cross-country descriptive analysis of the status of minorities around the world measured in terms of their changing share in a country's population over 65 years between 1950 and 2015.\n\nFor the 167 countries analysed, the average value for the share of the majority religious denomination in the baseline year of 1950 is 75 per cent, while the mean of the distribution capturing the change in majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015 is (minus) 21.9.\n\nThe paper said that 21 out of the 40 countries that experienced extreme changes in population matrix are from Africa.\n\nFurthermore, 35 high-income OECD countries witnessed an average 29 per cent decline in the share of the majority religion, which is significantly higher than the global average.\n\n\"This means that globally, the share of the majority religious denomination has gone down by approximately 22 per cent.

In India, the share of majority Hindu population dipped by 7.82 percent, while the Muslim population saw a 43.15 percent increase in the corresponding period, according to a working paper released by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM).\n\nThe report said all religious minorities in India, barring Jains and Parsis, saw a rise in their population share in this period. It shows India has seen the \"second most significant decline in the majority population (7.82%), only next to Myanmar (10%) within the immediate South Asian neighbourhood\", dding that minority populations substantially shrunk in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan.\n\nThe research, titled 'Share of Religious Minorities - A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)', was conducted by members of the EAC-PM, and highlights a global trend toward greater religious heterogeneity over the past 65 years. The paper, authored by Shamika Ravi, Apurv Kumar Mishra, and Abraham Jose, provides a critical examination of the shifts in religious demographics from 1950 to 2015 across the 167 countries, using the Religious Characteristics of States Dataset (RCS-Dem, 2017).\n\nAccording to the study, in 1950, the average share of the majority religious group in these countries was 75 per cent. By 2015, this had fallen by approximately 22 per cent, indicating that societies globally are becoming more religiously diverse. This trend is most pronounced in Africa, where the majority religious denomination changed in more than half of the countries studied. For instance, countries that predominantly followed Animism in 1950 no longer do so, underscoring significant shifts in religious adherence.\n\nChristian-majority countries have seen a general decline in their majority shares, with 77 out of 94 countries reporting a decrease. Conversely, Muslim-majority countries have mostly witnessed growth in their dominant religious groups.\n\nALSO READ: 18 Pakistani Hindu Refugees Granted Indian Citizenship In Ahmedabad\n\nIndia has seen a decrease of 7.82 per cent in its majority Hindu population over 65 years, dropping from 84.68 per cent in 1950 to 78.06 per cent in 2015. However, its Muslim-majority neighbours, including Bangladesh and Pakistan, have recorded increases in the population of the majority community.\n\nIn India, the proportion of the majority Hindu population declined by 7.82 per cent from 1950 to 2015, dropping from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent. Over the same period, the Muslim population share increased from 9.84 per cent to 14.09 per cent, marking a significant rise of 43.15 per cent. Christians also saw a slight increase from 2.24 per cent to 2.36 per cent, reflecting a growth of 5.38 per cent. Sikhs experienced a rise from 1.24 per cent to 1.85 per cent, indicating a 6.58 per cent increase. The Buddhist population share notably increased from 0.05 per cent to 0.81 per cent.\n\nThe Jain population share, meanwhile, decreased from 0.45 per cent to 0.36 per cent. The Parsi community witnessed a substantial decline of 85 per cent, dipping from a 0.03 per cent share in 1950 to a mere 0.004 per cent in 2015.\n\nThe decline in the majority Hindu population marks India as a distinct case of increasing religious plurality within South Asia, a region otherwise marked by growing religious homogeneity, especially in Muslim-majority countries.\n\nFor context, neighbouring Bangladesh has seen an 18 per cent increase in its majority Muslim population, the largest rise in the subcontinent. Pakistan has also witnessed a 3.75 per cent increase in its majority Hanafi Muslim population since 1950, further highlighting the contrasting trends between India and its neighbours.\n\nAcross the Indian subcontinent, most Muslim-majority nations experienced a rise in the proportion of their dominant religious group, except for Maldives, where the prevalence of the majority faction, Shafi'i Sunnis, decreased by 1.47 per cent. According to the report, Muslim-majority Bangladesh saw the largest surge, with an 18 per cent increase in the dominance of its major religious group, marking a significant shift in the region. Pakistan observed a 3.75 per cent uptick in the dominance of Hanafi Muslims, alongside a 10 per cent rise in the overall Muslim populace, despite the partition that led to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nOn the other hand, Myanmar, India, and Nepal, all non-Muslim majority nations, experienced a decline in the dominance of their major religious groups. Myanmar faced the most pronounced decrease, with the share of Theravada Buddhist adherents dropping by 10 per cent during the study period. In Nepal, the Hindu majority declined by 4 per cent, Buddhists decreased by 3 per cent, while Muslims saw a 2 per cent rise.\n\nSri Lanka and Bhutan, among the non-Muslim majority countries, were exceptions, witnessing an increase in the dominance of their major religious groups from 1950 to 2015. Sri Lanka saw a 5 per cent increase in Theravada Buddhist dominance, while Hindus, the next largest religious group, saw a 5 per cent decline. Bhutan experienced a notable rise of nearly 18 per cent in the dominance of Tibetan Buddhists, whereas the Hindu population dwindled from 23 per cent to 11 per cent during the same period.\n\nALSO READ | About 37% Of India's Female Population Is Employed: Study\n\n\"India's performance suggests that there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society. It is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach,\" authors of the EAC-PM paper noted.\n\n\"India is one of the few countries which has a legal definition of minorities and provides constitutionally protected rights for them. The outcomes of these progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the growing number of minority populations within India,\" they added.\n\nCiting Tibetan Buddhists who had to flee China six decades ago, Matuas who came from Bangladesh to escape religious persecution, and refugees from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and Myanmar, the paper points out that it is because of India's policies and institutions that minority populations from the neighbourhood came to this country when faced with duress. \"Given its plural, liberal and democratic nature, India has continued its civilizational tradition of harbouring persecuted populations from several countries over the last six decades,\" the authors said.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news",

(Image: Getty)\n\nA study by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) has revealed that the population share of the majority religion in India (Hindus) declined sharply by 7.8% between 1950 and 2015, while a number of neighbouring countries saw a jump in the population of their majority community.\n\nWhile the Hindu population shrunk in India, the share of minorities, including Muslim, Christian, Buddhist and Sikhs, went up. However, the number of Jains and Parsis in the population mix decreased.\n\nBetween 1950 and 2015, the Muslim population share in India surged by 43.15%, Christians saw a 5.38% increase, Sikhs a 6.58% rise, and Buddhists witnessed a slight increase.\n\nThe share of Hindus in India's population saw a decrease from 84% in 1950 to 78% in 2015, while that of Muslims witnessed an increase from 9.84% to 14.09% in the same period (of 65 years), according to the EAC-PM study.\n\nThe shrinking of the majority population in India (by 7.8%) is the second most significant decline in the immediate neighbourhood, just after Myanmar's 10%.\n\nApart from India, Nepal's majority community (Hindu) saw a 3.6% decline in its share of the country's population.\n\nThe study, whose report was released in May 2024, assessed the trends in 167 countries across the world.\n\nThe authors of the study say \"India's performance is consistent with the larger global trends\".\n\n\"Contrary to the noise in several quarters, careful analysis of the data shows that minorities are not just protected, but indeed thriving in India,\" the authors say.\n\nIndia's population growth story is starkly different from countries in its immediate neighbourhood.\n\nThe share of the Indian majority community, the Hindus, in the country's population declined by 7.8% between 1950 and 2015. However, in the neighbouring countries, where Muslims are a majority, the community's share witnessed an increase in the demographic mix.\n\nBangladesh saw the steepest increase of 18.5%, followed by Pakistan (3.75%) and Afghanistan (0.29%).\n\n\"Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75% in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10% increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971,\" noted the study co-authored by Shamika Ravi, Abraham Jose and Apurv Kumar Mishra.\n\nIndia's eastern neighbour, Myanmar, saw the highest decline in the majority community's share in the country's population in India's neighbourhood. The majority population of the Theravada Buddhists in Myanmar dipped by 10% in 65 years.\n\nApart from India and Myanmar, Nepal saw a 3.6% decline in its majority Hindu population, said the EAC-PM study.\n\nIn the Maldives, the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47%.\n\nHowever, India's neighbours with a majority Buddhist population, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, also saw an increase of 17.6% and 5.25%, respectively, according to the study released in May 2024.\n\n\"The change in the proportion of minorities as a share of the total population serves as a reliable proxy for the status of minorities in a country, which is fostered through policies including defining minorities, which itself is a rare practice globally,\" said the study, which assessed the trends in 167 countries globally.\n\nThe change in numbers in India is in line with the global trends of a declining majority, according to the study. In certain cases, like in countries like Australia, China, Canada, New Zealand and a handful of east African nations, the dip in the majority community's share in the population saw a steeper plunge than India's.\n\n\"The share of the majority religious denominations in 167 countries has, on average, reduced by 22% from 1950-2015. The change varies from a 99% decrease in Liberia to an 80% increase in Namibia. 123 countries experienced a decrease in the share of the majority denomination,\" noted the study.\n\nAdditionally, the 35 high-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations saw a substantial average decline of 29% in the proportion of the majority religion, surpassing the global average of 22%.\n\nThe OECD is a multilateral grouping of 38 western countries with a free-market economy.\n\nThat said, the study clarified that it did not try to figure out why these changes happened, but rather looked at the numbers to see if minorities were getting more or less represented in society.\n\n\"A decrease in the share of the majority population and a consequent increase in the share of minorities suggests that the net result of all policy actions, political decisions and societal processes is to provide a conducive environment for increasing diversity in society,\" says the study by the PM's economic council.\n\nThe authors say that India's trend suggests \"there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society\".\n\nThe study lauds India's policies and institutions for bettering the lives of its minorities.\n\n\"The outcomes of these progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the growing number of minority populations within India,\" the

The study, named \"Share of religious minorities: A cross-country analysis,\" shed light on change in demographics from 1950 to 2015.\n\nAccording to the findings, India's Hindu majority population experienced a decline of 7.81 per cent during the 65-year period.In contrast, the Muslim community in India witnessed a significant increase of 43.15 per cent within the same timeframe.\n\nThe study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how religious composition has evolved in different nations over the past several decades, offering valuable insights into this critical dimension of demographic transformation.\n\nAccording to the report, the global average for the share of the majority religious denomination in 1950 was 75%. By 2015, this figure had decreased by approximately 22%, indicating a global trend towards greater religious heterogeneity. The study highlights significant regional differences. For instance, more than half of the countries with the largest demographic shifts are located in Africa, where shifts from animist majorities to other religious denominations were most common.\n\nCountries like India and several OECD nations have also seen declines in their majority religious shares, signaling a diversification of religious demographics. In contrast, many Muslim-majority countries have seen an increase in the share of their dominant religious groups.\n\nSouth Asia\n\nThe report reveals that India, like many other South Asian nations, has experienced a noticeable decrease in the share of its majority religious group. In 1950, the majority religious group in India comprised a larger share of the population compared to 2015, reflecting a trend towards greater religious diversity and pluralism. This change is attributed to various factors including demographic shifts, migration patterns, and changing socio-political landscapes.\n\nAs per the report, specifically, all the Muslim-majority countries in this study saw an increase in the share of their dominant religious groups, with the sole exception of the Maldives. In the Maldives, the majority group, Shafi'i Sunnis, experienced a decrease of 1.47 per cent.\n\nAmong the non-Muslim majority nations, the trends were mixed. Myanmar, India, and Nepal all saw a reduction in the proportion of their majority religious groups. Conversely, in Sri Lanka and Bhutan, the share of the majority denomination saw an increase. The extent of these changes varied widely across the region, with Myanmar experiencing the most significant drop of 9.84 percent in its Theravada Buddhist population, reducing from 79 per cent to 71 per cent. Bangladesh observed the most substantial increase, where the Hanafi Muslim population surged by 18.55 per cent, from 74 per cent to 88 per cent of the populace.\n\nIndia: Share of Hindu population down by 7.82%\n\nThe share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent from 1950 to 2015, moving from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent.

Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75% in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10% increase in the share of total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nAccording to the report, among non-Muslim majority countries, Myanmar, India and Nepal saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination.\n\n1950 as baseline year\n\nThe paper noted that the year 1950 is important as a baseline year for two major reasons.\n\nThis was around the time that the international human rights framework under the aegis of the newly created United Nations began to take shape with minority rights and state responsibility for protection of minorities being mainstreamed in international law, the paper said.\n\nThe paper is a detailed cross-country descriptive analysis of the status of minorities around the world measured in terms of their changing share in a country's population over 65 years between 1950 and 2015.\n\nFor the 167 countries analysed, the average value for the share of the majority religious denomination in the baseline year of 1950 is 75%, while the mean of the distribution capturing the change in majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015 is 21.9.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It, however, did not give absolute numbers.\n\nThe last census in the country was done in 2011, and the one due in 2021 has not been conducted. It was also not clear how the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister arrived at the 2015 numbers.\n\nThe paper titled 'Share of Religious Minorities: A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)' further said the share of Jains in the population of India decreased from 0.45% in 1950 to 0.36% in 2015.\n\n\"...The share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82% between 1950 and 2015 (from 84.68% to 78.06%). The share of the Muslim population in 1950 was 9.84% and increased to 14.09% in 2015 - a 43.15% increase in their share,\" said the paper prepared by a team led by Shamika Ravi, member, EAC-PM.\n\nAccording to the paper, the share of the Christian population rose from 2.24% to 2.36 % - an increase of 5.38% between 1950 and 2015.\n\nWhile the share of the Sikh population increased from 1.24% in 1950 to 1.85% in 2015 - a 6.58% rise in their share, the share of the Parsi population in India witnessed a stark 85% decline, reducing from 0.03% share in 1950 to 0.004% in 2015.\n\nThe data indicates that \"there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society,\" the paper said, adding that it is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach.\n\nThe paper noted that a decrease in the share of the majority population and a consequent increase in the share of minorities suggests that the net result of all policy actions, political decisions and societal processes is to provide a conducive environment for increasing diversity in society.\n\nThe report pointed out that in keeping with the global trends of declining majority, India too has witnessed a reduction in the share of the majority religious denomination by 7.82%.\n\n\"This is particularly remarkable given the wider context within the South Asian neighbourhood where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly across countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan,\" the paper said.\n\nThe paper said it is not surprising, therefore, minority populations from across the neighbourhood come to India during times of duress.\n\nIt pointed out that all the Muslim-majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except Maldives, where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47%.\n\nIn Bangladesh, there was an 18% increase in the share of the majority religious group, which is the largest such increase in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nPakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75% in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10% increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nAccording to the report, among non-Muslim majority countries, Myanmar, India and Nepal saw a decline in the share of the majority religious denomination.\n\nThe paper noted that the year 1950 is important as a baseline year for two major reasons.\n\nThis was around the time that the international human rights framework under the aegis of the newly created United Nations began to take shape with minority rights and state responsibility for the protection of minorities being mainstreamed in international law, the paper said.\n\nThe paper is a detailed cross-country descriptive analysis of the status of minorities around the world measured in terms of their changing share in a country's population over 65 years between 1950 and 2015.\n\nFor the 167 countries analysed, the average value for the share of the majority religious denomination in the baseline year of 1950 is 75%, while the mean of the distribution capturing the change in majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015 is (minus) 21.9.\n\nThe paper said that 21 out of the 40 countries that experienced extreme changes in population matrix are from Africa. Furthermore, 35 high-income OECD countries witnessed an average 29% decline in the share of the majority religion, which is significantly higher than the global average.\n\n\"This means that globally, the share of the majority religious denomination has gone down by approximately 22%. In other words, on average the world has become more heterogeneous in the period under study,\" it concluded.\n\n'Population rise not related to religion'\n\nNew Delhi: Population growth rates are not linked to religion and the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) among all religious groups is declining, with the highest decrease observed among Muslims, NGO Population Foundation of India has said amid a debate over the increase in the population of minorities in India.\n\nThe Population Foundation of India said it is deeply concerned about recent media reports \"misreporting\" findings from the study to spread alarm regarding growth of Muslim population in the country.\n\n\"The study's focus on changes in the share of majority and minority religious groups globally over a 65-year period should not be used to incite fear or discrimination against any community,\" it said.\n\nAccording to census figures, the decadal growth rate for Muslims has been declining over the past three decades. Specifically, the decadal growth rate for Muslims decreased from 32.9% in 1981-1991 to 24.6% in 2001-2011.\n\n\"This decline is more pronounced than that of Hindus, whose growth rate fell from 22.7%

However, the number of Jains and Parsis in the population mix decreased.\n\nBetween 1950 and 2015, the Muslim population share in India surged by 43.15 per cent, Christians saw a 5.38 per cent increase, Sikhs a 6.58 per cent rise, and Buddhists a marginal increase.\n\nAs against India's shrinking majority population, the majority Muslim population's share in the demographies of Pakistan and Bangladesh increased. Globally as many as 123 countries saw a dip in the share of their majority communities. The shrinking of the majority population in India (by 7.8 per cent) is the second most significant decline in the immediate neighbourhood, just after Myanmar's 10 per cent.

The authors of the study say \"India's performance is consistent with the larger global trends\".\n\n\"Contrary to the noise in several quarters, careful analysis of the data shows that minorities are not just protected, but indeed thriving in India,\" the authors say. Bangladesh saw the steepest increase of 18.5 per cent, followed by Pakistan (3.75 per cent and Afghanistan (0.29 per cent). \"Pakistan witnessed an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of the total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971,\" noted the study co-authored by Shamika Ravi, Abraham Jose and Apurv Kumar Mishra.\n\nIn the Maldives, the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 per cent. However, India's neighbours with a majority Buddhist population, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, also saw an increase of17.6 per cent and 5.25 per cent, respectively.\n\nIn certain countries like Australia, China, Canada, New Zealand and a handful of east African nations, the dip in the majority community's share in the population saw a steeper plunge than India's.\n\n\"The share of the majority religious denominations in 167 countries has, on average, reduced by 22 per cent from 1950-2015. The change varies from a 99 per cent decrease in Liberia to an 80 per cent increase in Namibia. 123 countries experienced a decrease in the share of the majority denomination,\" noted the study.\n\nAdditionally, the 35 high-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations (a grouping of 38 western countries) saw a substantial average decline of 29 per cent in the proportion of the majority religion, surpassing the global average of 22 per cent.\n\nThe study clarified that it did not try to figure out why these changes happened, but rather looked at the

According to the study titled \"Share of religious minorities: A cross-country analysis,\" the proportion of India's Hindu population decreased by 7.81%, settling at 78.06% by 2015.\n\nConversely, the study reveals that the Muslim population saw a notable rise of 43.15%, reaching 14.09% of the total population by 2015. Similarly, the Christian community also experienced an increase, growing by 5.4% to constitute 2.36% of the population during the same period.\n\nLikewise, the study indicates that the Sikh and Buddhist communities experienced growth, reaching proportions of 1.85% and 0.81% respectively by 2015. However, the share of Jains and Parsis in the population declined, with figures standing at 0.36% and 0.004% respectively during the same period.\n\n\"We are interested in noting the composition of demographic changes in these countries because of their geographical proximity to India. Therefore, any significant fluctuation in their population has a spillover effect on the polity and policies of India,\" the study reads.\n\nAccording to the authors of the study, despite various discussions suggesting otherwise, the data indicates that minorities in India are not only protected but are also flourishing. This observation is especially noteworthy when considering the broader South Asian context, where the proportion of the majority religious denomination has risen, and minority populations have significantly diminished in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Afghanistan.\n\nGlobally, there has been a noticeable decrease of approximately 22% in the share of the majority religious denomination, indicating a trend towards greater diversity during the study period. Across every major continent, more countries have witnessed a decline in the proportion of the majority religious group than an increase.\n\nThe study underscores the significant role played by the religion associated with the majority group in countries experiencing profound changes. It highlights that among the 20 countries witnessing the most substantial increase in the share of the majority religious group between 1950 and 2015, all of them are nations where Christianity or Islam-based denominations constitute the majority religious affiliation.\n\nConversely, the study also noted that among the 20 countries experiencing the greatest decline in the share of the majority religious group, only three had Christianity or Islam-based denominations as the majority religious affiliation. Instead, animism was predominant in 16 of these countries. This highlights the diversity of religious dynamics and the varying trends observed across different regions and religious traditions.\n\nThe council's study clarified that it focused on analyzing the numerical shifts in demographic representation rather than delving into the reasons behind these changes.\n\n\"India's performance suggests that there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society. It is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach.

The Buddhist population saw an increase from 0.05 per cent in 1950 to 0.81, while the Muslims group witnessed 43.15 percent increase in their population share.\n\nThe report claimed that India offers a ground of conducive environment fostering diversity. \"It is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach,\" the paper said.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries that provide a legal definition and equal constitutional rights to the minorities, protecting them from any external threat, the paper claimed. \"The outcomes of these progressive policies and inclusive institutions are reflected in the growing number of minority populations within India,\" it added.\n\nReports Backs Need For CAA\n\nIn wake of the alarming deduction in share of minority groups in the neighbourhood countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, it's not surprising that minority populations from across the neighborhood come to India during times of duress.\n\nThe nourishing environment in India for its citizens irrespective of religion has been a strong ground for the neighbourhood minorities to shift their lands.\n\nGiving the matter a Constitutional touch, the Centre recently notified the rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019. It paved way for its implementation after four years since it was passed in the Parliament in December 2019.\n\nCAA, the Indian legislation, provides a path for migrants belonging to six religious minorities: Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, to obtain Indian citizenship legally.\n\nCacophony of Minorities In Danger\n\nThe systematic efforts by the Central government has uplifted the poor and minority groups including the Muslim community- the Pasmanda and Arzal (Dalit)- to rise in the social, economic and political sphere. The Muslim women have become the beneficiaries of central guideline regulating 'triple talaq,' a regressive practive which continued in India while most of the Islamic nations rejected it.\n\nWith general elections ongoing, cacophony about minorities in danger emerged yet again with opposition leaders giving call for 'vote jihad' and full Muslim reservation. Samajwadi Party leader Maria Alam, the niece of Congress leader Salman Khurshid, appealed to the public to practice 'vote jihad' in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.\n\nOn the other hand, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav pitched for full reservation to Muslims in India from SC/ST and OBCs share, drawing 'appeasement politics' jibe from the BJP.

The share of the Christian population rose from 2.24% to 2.36% -- an increase of 5.38% between 1950 and 2015. The share of the Sikh population increased from 1.24% in 1950 to 1.85% in 2015 -- a 6.58% rise in their share. However, not all minority groups experienced growth; the Jain and Parsi populations saw a decline during this time.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Religion_Data_Archives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Religion Data Archives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l88220240508142300.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549099", "eventUri": "eng-9549099", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Not anymore. Now it has transformed into an unshakeable fact.\n\nData furnished by a top economic panel proves that, at least in South Asia, countries with a Hindu majority are most tolerant and those with Muslim majorities the least.\n\nA study prepared by the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PM-EAC) covering a period of 65 years from 1950 to 2015 has established this.\n\nThe data recorded by the panel shows that in South Asia, \"all Muslim majority countries witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination except the Maldives, where the share of the majority group (Shafi'i Sunnis) declined by 1.47 per cent\".\n\nIn Bangladesh, the study concludes \"there was an 18 per cent increase in the share of the Muslim majority religious group, which is the largest such increase in the Indian subcontinent\".\n\nIn Pakistan, \"there was an increase of 3.75 per cent in the share of the majority religious denomination (Hanafi Muslim) and a 10 per cent increase in the share of total Muslim population despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971\". Unfortunately, in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the rise in the population of Muslims has meant that the second largest demographic, the Hindu community, has shrunk alarmingly. In Pakistan, the Hindu community declined by a staggering 8 per cent and, in Bangladesh, by an equally precipitous 66 per cent.\n\nClearly, Hindus are teetering on the brink of extinction in these nations and it doesn't take rocket science to figure out why. A glance at the headline grabbing reports of atrocities against Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh clearly establishes religious intolerance as the principal motive.\n\nIn sharp contrast, in India and Nepal, which are both Hindu majority countries, the share of the majority or Hindu population dropped noticeably by 7.8 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. In fact, in both India and Nepal, the population of minorities rose appreciably and, particularly so, in the case of Muslims. The data clearly establishes that Hindus who are not ordained to swear by one infallible god are more tolerant of diversity.\n\nThis becomes even clearer when one looks at demographic trends in non-Muslim and non-Hindu South Asian nations. The high-powered panel's report reveals that \"Sri Lanka and Bhutan have witnessed an increase in the share of the majority religious denomination between 1950 and 2015. In Sri Lanka, the share of the majority Theravada Buddhist population increased by 5 per cent. In Bhutan, the majority Tibetan Buddhist population increased by almost 18 per cent. In these Buddhist majority states, too, the Hindu population has taken a beating. In Sri Lanka, the share of Hindu population declined by 5 per cent and, in Bhutan, too, it declined from 23 per cent to 11 per cent in the same period.\n\nThe implosion of the Hindu majority population in non-Hindu majority South Asian states stands out for another striking reason. The panel report notes that Hindu share of the population shrank in the non-Hindu majority South Asian nations at a time when across the world the share of minority populations increased on an average by 22 per cent.\n\nTo conclude, the study proves, specifically with respect to India, that those who claim that Muslims are under threat are spreading baseless canards. As the data shows the opposite is true. Minorities, especially Muslims, are not just protected but thriving in India.\n\nIn fact, it could be proposed that it is Hindus who are facing existential demographic pressures in Nepal and India that may lead to them becoming a minority in the decades ahead. This might seem improbable now, but don't rule it out. The study has adduced enough examples of countries where in just 65 years the majority has become the minority.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religious denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi'i_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shafi'i school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian subcontinent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indian subcontinent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_intolerance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious intolerance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theravada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Vietnam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism in Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tibetan Buddhism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/untitled-design-2024-05-efe148ed928888e789d16b2427130abe-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549099", "eventUri": "eng-9549099", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Population Foundation of India counters with data showing decreasing TFR for all religious groups, including Muslims.\n\nA government panel report on the rise in Muslim population in the country kicked up a political slugfest on Thursday with the ruling BJP targeting the Congress on its pitch for giving reservation to the minority community and the opposition accusing the saffron party of trying to create a communal divide amid ongoing parliamentary elections.\n\nThis came after a recent working paper by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) said the share of the Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 in India, while that of Muslims increased by 43.15 per cent, suggesting that there is a conducive environment in the country to foster diversity.\n\nThe paper titled 'Share of Religious Minorities: A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)' further said the share of Jains in the population of India decreased from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015.\n\nLatching on to the report, the BJP expressed concern over the pace of increase in Muslim population in the country and wondered its impact on the reservation provided to SCs, STs and OBCs, claiming the Congress is ''hell bent'' on providing quota to the minority community if voted to power.\n\n''If you see the 1951 census, Hindus were having 88 per cent population and Muslims 9.5 per cent. In the 2011 census, Hindus (population) reduced to 79.8 percent from 80 percent while Muslims' percentage went up by more than 14.5,'' BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi told PTI, when asked for comment.\n\n''But, the question arises that if by this pace the population is increasing and Congress is hell bent upon giving reservation to the Muslims on the basis of population, they will cut the share of the SCs, STs and the OBCs,'' he added.\n\nTrivedi said the Congress, if voted to power, will then keep on ''changing'' the share of reservation in future with increase in the Muslim population, ''which is more likely because they (Muslims) are having possibility of multiple marriages''.\n\nMuslims share in the reservation will keep on increasing also because of ''conversion and infiltration because they are having a secular cover from them (the Congress)'', he claimed.\n\nHitting back, the opposition leaders accused the BJP of trying to create communal divide over the report amid ongoing Lok Sabha elections.\n\nCPI general secretary D Raja and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav slammed the Union government for not conducting the census, and called the working paper by the EAC-PM an attempt to get votes by creating strife.\n\n''Why has the PM's economic advisory council come out with this report at a time when the country is going for elections?'' he asked.\n\n''The prime minister is already trying to polarise people in the name of Muslims, talking about handing over keys of Ram Mandir to Muslims... He is taking up all such issues. That means there is an attempt to polarise people by bringing out such data. People should be cautious of such reports,'' Raja alleged.\n\nSlamming the BJP over the report, Yadav said, ''The census that was to happen in 2020-21 has not been done till now, it's 2024.'' ''Their (BJP) aim is only to mislead the people of the country and to spread hatred. This is the agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP. They have fooled people of this country for ten years, and they want to do that again,'' the RJD leader charged.\n\nSamajwadi Party MP ST Hassan also flayed the BJP over the report and said its a conspiracy to create hatred and polarise the voters. ''It's election time. Any report can come... Modi ji is rattled,'' he told PTI.\n\nUnion minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the EAC-PM's report raises many questions because one particular community is ''increasing its population in a manner where demography of India is being altered, changed''.\n\n''How much of this growth in Muslim community (population) is being caused by illegal immigration and conversion?...What will be the consequence when you have the Muslim community increasing its population so rapidly, from 9 per cent to 14.5 per cent and there are political forces that want to give them reservation?'' he asked.\n\nUnion minister Giriraj Singh alleged that Hindu population in the country has gone down due to the Congress' politics of appeasement.\n\n''Hindu population is decreasing, Muslim population is increasing... It shows that in the days to come, they want to make India an Islamic state,'' he charged.\n\nAmid debate over EAC-PM's report, Population Foundation of India, a non-government organisation, said the population growth rates are not linked to religion and the total fertility rate (TFR) among all religious groups is declining, with the highest decrease observed among Muslims.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhanshu_Trivedi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudhanshu Trivedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejashwi_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tejashwi Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Raja", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

The study indicates that while the Hindu population in India experienced a notable decline of 7.8% between 1950 and 2015, several minority communities, including Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and Buddhists, saw an increase in their respective shares. However, the populations of Jains and Parsis witnessed a decrease during this period.\n\nIn contrast to India, where the Hindu population declined, neighboring countries with majority Muslim populations, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, experienced a rise in their demographic representation. Notably, Pakistan witnessed a 3.75% increase in the share of its majority religious denomination, despite the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nThe study, released in May 2024, examined demographic trends in 167 countries worldwide. It highlights that India's demographic changes align with broader global patterns of declining majority populations. This trend is observed across various countries, including those in the OECD, where the proportion of majority religious denominations has decreased significantly.\n\nDespite these shifts, the study emphasizes that it did not delve into the reasons behind these changes but focused on assessing the representation of minority populations in society. It suggests that India's policies and institutions have fostered a conducive environment for increasing diversity, leading to the growth of minority populations within the country.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susmita_modak@thehansindia.com", "name": "Susmita Modak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OECD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/05/08/1444722-population.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549099", "eventUri": "eng-9549099", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

In the 2011 census, Hindus (population) reduced to 79.8 percent from 80 percent while Muslims' percentage went up by more than 14.5,\" BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi told PTI, when asked for comment.\n\n\"But, the question arises that if by this pace the population is increasing and Congress is hell bent upon giving reservation to the Muslims on the basis of population, they will cut the share of the SCs, STs and the OBCs,\" he added.\n\nTrivedi said the Congress, if voted to power, will then keep on \"changing\" the share of reservation in future with increase in the Muslim population, \"which is more likely because they (Muslims) are having possibility of multiple marriages\".\n\nMuslims share in the reservation will keep on increasing also because of \"conversion and infiltration because they are having a secular cover from them (the Congress)\", he claimed.\n\nHitting back, the opposition leaders accused the BJP of trying to create communal divide over the report amid ongoing Lok Sabha elections.\n\nCPI general secretary D Raja and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav slammed the Union government for not conducting the census, and called the working paper by the EAC-PM an attempt to get votes by creating strife.\n\n\"Why has the PM's economic advisory council come out with this report at a time when the country is going for elections?\" he asked.\n\n\"The prime minister is already trying to polarise people in the name of Muslims, talking about handing over keys of Ram Mandir to Muslims... He is taking up all such issues. That means there is an attempt to polarise people by bringing out such data. People should be cautious of such reports,\" Raja alleged.\n\nSlamming the BJP over the report, Yadav said, \"The census that was to happen in 2020-21 has not been done till now, it's 2024.\" \"Their (BJP) aim is only to mislead the people of the country and to spread hatred. This is the agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP. They have fooled people of this country for ten years, and they want to do that again,\" the RJD leader charged.\n\nSamajwadi Party MP ST Hassan also flayed the BJP over the report and said its a conspiracy to create hatred and polarise the voters. \"It's election time. Any report can come... Modi ji is rattled,\" he told PTI.\n\nUnion minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the EAC-PM's report raises many questions because one particular community is \"increasing its population in a manner where demography of India is being altered, changed\".\n\n\"How much of this growth in Muslim community (population) is being caused by illegal immigration and conversion?...What will be the consequence when you have the Muslim community increasing its population so rapidly, from 9 per cent to 14.5 per cent and there are political forces that want to give them reservation?\" he asked.\n\nUnion minister Giriraj Singh alleged that Hindu population in the country has gone down due to the Congress' politics of appeasement.\n\n\"Hindu population is decreasing, Muslim population is increasing...

Similarly, Muslims' share in population had risen from 9.84% to 14.09%.\n\nThe last Census of India was conducted in 2011 with the government indefinitely delaying the 2021 Census. The 2011 Census had counted 96.63 crore Hindus -- 79.8% of the population and 17.22 crore Muslims -- 14.2% of the population in the country at the time.\n\nIn showing changing shares of religious groups' populations, the EAC-PM's working paper has expressed the difference in populations between 1950 and 2015 as a percentage of the population of those respective religious groups in 1950. As a result, the Muslim community's difference in share of population, which is coming to a rise of 4.25 percentage points, is being expressed as a \"43.15% increase\" compared to the Muslim population as of 1950. Using this method, the paper has concluded that Hindus' share declined by 7.82%, Christians' rose by 5.38%, Sikhs' went up by 6.58%, and that of Parsis went down by 85%.\n\nIt has not used this presentation of data for Buddhists and Jains. If one were to apply the same calculations, it would show the Buddhist population had increased by 1,520% in this time when in fact their share had increased from 0.05% to 0.81% in the total population. The working paper, instead, refers to this as just a \"noticeable increase\".\n\nThe authors of the paper make the claim that as per their \"careful analysis\", increases in the population of minority religious groups in India \"shows that minorities are not just protected but indeed thriving in India\". It calls this \"particularly remarkable\" when compared to data from South Asian countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Afghanistan \"where the share of the majority religious denomination has increased and minority populations have shrunk alarmingly\".\n\nThe working paper said that it was produced in a bid to counter \"noise in several quarters\" about India's tilt towards majoritarianism and attacks on Muslim and Sikh minorities. What it cited as \"noise\" in the footnotes, were reports published by Time (on the targeting of Sikhs), The Guardian (on Hindu supremacists in India), and The Wire (on comments made by United Nations experts and Rapporteurs on India).\n\nMeanwhile, the PFI pointed out in its statement, \"Successful family planning programmes in Muslim-majority countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia have resulted in lower birth rates compared to India. These countries have achieved this through higher levels of female education, greater employment opportunities, and better access to contraceptive choices. This clearly shows that fertility decline is influenced by development factors rather than religious affiliation.\"\n\nAs the findings from the working paper started making it to social media on Thursday, it soon took a political colour, with BJP leaders fixating on the India statistic of Muslims' population and using that to question the increase in the population of \"one particular community\" and its purported dangers. Meanwhile, some Opposition leaders like D. Raja of the Communist Party of India (CPI) questioned the motive behind releasing this paper while the Lok Sabha election was under way when the Census had been indefinitely delayed by the government.\n\n\"The media's selective portrayal of data to highlight the increase in the Muslim population is an example of misrepresentation that ignores broader demographic trends,\" the PFI statement said, quoting its executive director Poonam Muttreja.\n\nThe PFI added that successive Censuses have shown that the decadal growth rate of Muslims has been on the decline for three decades now, with this decline more pronounced in Muslims than in Hindus. It also noted that National Family Health Surveys conducted by the Union government had also shown that the TFR for all religious groups in India was declining, with the largest decline being seen amongst Muslims.\n\nThe latest NFHS (2019-2021) report released in May 2022, showed that the TFR for Muslims was at 2.36, only marginally higher than the 1.94 TFR recorded for the aggregate of all Hindu communities and of the national average, which was at 2.\n\nThe PFI, in its statement, called for responsible reporting of the working paper, adding, \"It is essential to present data accurately and contextually, highlighting the role of education, income, and socioeconomic development in shaping demographic trends. We advocate for policies that promote inclusive development and gender equity to ensure a balanced and harmonious society.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_finance_initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private finance initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poonam_Muttreja", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poonam Muttreja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Family_Health_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Family Health Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(India)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wire (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Raja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.

However, the proportion of Jains and Parsis in the mix decreased. In contrast, the study found that majority communities in many neighboring countries experienced a population increase.\n\nAccording to the study, the proportion of Hindus in India's population increased from 84.68 percent in 1950 to 78.06 percent in 2015, while the proportion of Muslims in the country decreased from 9.84 percent to 14.09 percent over the same 65-year period.\n\nComparative Decline in Majority Population\n\nIndia's majority population is declining at a rate that is second most significant among its immediate neighbors, after Myanmar's 10% decline. The population of the majority Hindu community in Nepal also decreased by 3.6%. The study, which evaluated trends in 167 countries, was published in May 2024. India's performance, according to the authors, is in line with broader global trends.\n\nBJP officials reacted quickly to the report. \"This is what decades of Congress rule did to us. Left to them, there would be no country for Hindus,\" Amit Malviya posted on X (formerly Twitter). Vishnu Vardhan Reddy, BJP Vice President of Andhra Pradesh, stated that under Congress' 50-year rule \"Hindus were treated as eighth-class citizens in their own country.\"\n\nConcerns Raised by Union Minister\n\nUnion Minister Rajeev Chandrashekar says \"This is a very significant issue on which all Indian should seriously ask a few questions because if only the Muslim community has increased its population by such a significant number over the last several years... How much of this growth has been because of illegal immigration and conversion? How much of this growth of the muslim community alone, is crowding out the other minority communities like Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Christians from the benefits that minorities get from GoI and state govts?\"\n\nHe added that, \"Given this large increasing population of one minority religion, the Muslims, and on top of that, some political parties wanting to alter the Constitution and give religion based reservation to the muslim community, what will that deadly combination of growth in population and reservations, what will the effect of that be on other much more deprived communities like OBCs, SCs and STs?...\"\n\nOwaisi Disregards EAC-PM Report\n\nAll India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi gave a response to the Economic Advisory Council to the PM (EAC-PM) report on Thursday. As a \"report from Whatsapp University,\" he disregarded it.\n\nWhen asked about the Hindu population's declining share, Owaisi said he needed to see the report before answering. He questioned the report's legitimacy and source, calling it a product of \"WhatsApp University.\"\n\nMaurya Blames Congress for Population Trends\n\nDeputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Keshav Prasad Maurya expressed similar views, holding the Congress accountable for the decrease in the Hindu population. He blamed the Congress's appeasement of Muslims policy for the growth in the Muslim population.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter, \"Hindu population in the country decreased by 7.8% in 65 years, Muslim population increased by 43% - the report is the result of wrong policies of Congress.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Whose report is this? Who made this report? Report from Whatsapp University. Who made this report?\"\n\nThe remarks of Owaisi come amidst the report of the Economic Advisory Council to the PM (EAC-PM) which said that in India, the share of the majority Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 (from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent), while the share of the Muslim population, which in 1950 was 9.84 per cent, increased to 14.09 per cent in 2015--a 43.15 per cent increase in their share. Earlier today, Amit Malviya, Bhartiya Janta Party's in-charge of the National Information and Technology Department targeted the Congress party over the report of the Economic Advisory Council to the PM (EAC-PM) and said that if the country is left to Congress, then there would be no country for Hindus.\n\nTaking to his official X handle, Amit Malviya tweeted, \"Share of Hindus shrunk 7.8% between 1950 and 2015. The Muslim population grew by 43%. This is what decades of Congress rule did to us. Left to them, there would be no country for Hindus.\" Meanwhile, Keshav Prasad Maurya, Uttar Pradesh's Deputy Chief Minister also held the Congress responsible for the decrease in the Hindu population and claimed that the Muslim population due to the party's Muslim appeasement politics.\n\nKeshav Prasad Maurya said, \"This is a topic of concern and this imbalance in the population--rise in Muslim population and decline in Hindu population, has happened because of the Congress' Muslim appeasement.\" According to the EAC report, the share of the Christian population rose from 2.24 per cent to 2.36 per cent--an increase of 5.38 per cent between 1950 and 2015.\n\nThe share of the Sikh population increased from 1.24 per cent in 1950 to 1.85 per cent in 2015--a 6.58 per cent rise in their share. Even the share of the Buddhist population witnessed a noticeable increase from 0.05 per cent in 1950 to 0.81 per cent. On the other hand, the share of Jains in the population of India decreased from 0.45 per cent in 1950 to 0.36 per cent in 2015.

If you see the 1951 census, Hindus were having 88 per cent population and Muslims 9.5 per cent. In the 2011 census, Hindus (population) reduced to 79.8 percent from 80 percent while Muslims' percentage went up by more than 14.5,\" BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi told PTI, when asked for comment.\n\n\"But, the question arises that if by this pace the population is increasing and Congress is hell bent upon giving reservation to the Muslims on the basis of population, they will cut the share of the SCs, STs and the OBCs,\" he added.\n\nTrivedi said the Congress, if voted to power will, then keep on \"changing\" the share of reservation in future with increase in the Muslim population, \"which is more likely because they (Muslims) are having possibility of multiple marriages\".\n\nMuslims share in the reservation will keep on increasing also because of \"conversion and infiltration because they are having a secular cover from them (the Congress)\", he added.\n\n\"So this is a bigger question and a bigger challenge which they (Congress) have to answer,\" the BJP spokesperson said.\n\nSenior BJP leader and Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that the EAC-PM's report raises many questions because one particular community is \"increasing its population in a manner where demography of India is being altered, changed\".\n\n\"This leads to some questions that need to be asked and answered,\" he said, adding \"How much of growth in Muslim community is being caused by illegal immigration and conversion?\" he asked.\n\n\"What is the impact of this significant increase in the minority community's (Muslims) population on the rights and opportunities (available) for the other minority communities? There are Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and Christians. Is there any crowding out of these minority communities as a consequence of this (rise in Muslim population)?\" Chandrasekhar asked.\n\nHe alleged that some political parties including the Congress are making \"huge attempt to alter the Constitution and bring religion based reservation\".\n\n\"So, what will be the consequence when you have the Muslim community increasing its population so rapidly, from 9 per cent to 14.5 per cent and there are political forces that want to give them reservation,\" he told PTI.\n\n\"What will be the consequence of that on the OBC, SC and ST communities who suffered for centuries in India and have been excluded from development,\" he said, adding that these are the questions which needs to be asked and answered because they will shape the future of

This shift mirrors similar patterns in Nepal and Myanmar. However, the scenario differs in 38 Islamic nations, where the Muslim population has grown.\n\nThe report highlights that, except for Parsis and Jains, all other religious minorities in India, including Christians, Buddhists, and Sikhs, witnessed a rise in their population share, collectively reaching 6.58% during the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hindu population in India decreased from 84.68% in 1950 to 78.06% in 2015, while the Muslim population rose from 9.84% to 14.09% during the same period.\n\nWhile the Hindu population declined, India's minorities saw an increase in their share from 1950 to 2015.

The survey found that during the same time period, the Muslim population in India had unprecedented growth of 43%, while the Hindu population share fell by around 8%. Hindus made up 84% of the population in 1950, but by 2015, that number had dropped to 78%.\n\nOn the other hand, the proportion of minority groups -- such as Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists -- rose. According to the survey, the percentage of Muslims increased from 9.84% to 14.09%, while the percentage of Christians, Sikhs and Buddhists increased by 5.38%, 6.58%, and 0.59%, respectively.\n\nThe decline in the Hindu population share in India is notable, marking the second most significant decline in the immediate neighbourhood after Myanmar's 10% decrease in its majority population. Additionally, Nepal, another South Asian country, saw a 3.6% decline in the share of its majority Hindu community.\n\nEconomists Shamika Ravi, Abraham Jose, and Apurv Kumar Mishra authored the report, emphasising India's significant decline in majority population and the notable increase in minority shares. They highlighted the rise in the shares of Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, and Sikh populations, along with a decline in the shares of Jain and Parsi populations.

This was already known from the decadal Census.\n\nOn Thursday, several news outlets reported on a study released by the prime minister's Economic Advisory Council on the changes in the share of population of religious minorities in 167 countries between 1950 and 2015.\n\nThe headline for most publications was that the share of Muslim population in India had risen from from 9.84% in 1950 to 14.09% in 2015 - which is so say, 43.15%. On the other hand, the share of India's Hindu population declined from 84.68% to 78.06% during that period - that is, 7.82%, the study said.\n\nUnion minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar claimed that the \"demography of India is being altered\" due to increase in population of a \"particular community\". He also linked the study to the Bharatiya Janata Party's claim that the Congress wanted to introduce reservations in education and government jobs on the basis of religion.\n\nThe first claim made by Chandrasekhar is misleading while the second one is outright false. The findings of the study about the change in religion-wise population share is not new and follows a trend that has been well-documented in the decadal Census.\n\nCensus data shows that the religious composition of the country's population has undergone only modest changes since 1951. In fact, the decadal growth rate for Muslims has been declining over the past three decades.\n\nAs far back as 2015, Shoaib Daniyal had written about the flaws in the arguments of the leaders of the Hindutva party. In an article headlined, \"Five charts that puncture the bogey of Muslim population growth\", he demonstrated how the rhetoric on demographics is belied by data. Read it here.\n\nThe second claim that the Congress intends to provide quotas on the basis of religion has been debunked by several organisations, including Scroll. The Congress manifesto makes no such promise.\n\nBJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi made similar claims, while the party's social media cell chief Amit Malviya claimed that the rise in share of population of Muslims was due to \"decades of Congress rule\".\n\nThe fact that BJP leaders are using a well-known fact about India's demographics to make misleading claims in the middle of the general elections raises questions on the timing of the release of the study. Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav asked how the study could have determined the country's population according to religion when the national Census, scheduled to be conducted in 2021, had not yet been started.\n\nThe introduction to the study, co-authored by Shamika Ravi, a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister, and two others, says that it was conducted to analyse shifting demographic trends \"aggravating economic disparity within and between countries, straining governance and fuelling friction between states and people\".\n\nThe study uses data from a 2017 research paper on religious demographics of several countries authored by Davis Brown, a researcher at the Baylor University in United States' Texas, and Patrick James, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.\n\nIn a section on the change in religious demographics in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation countries, the study by the prime minister's advisory council notes the increase in Muslim population and the decline in Hindu population in India.\n\nThe findings do not reveal anything new. Neither do they signal that India's demography is changing significantly, as Chandrasekhar suggested.\n\nIn 2021, a Pew Research Center analysis of Census conducted in India showed that in 1951, Muslims accounted for 9.8% of India's population in 1951, while in 2011 the share was 14.2%. In the corresponding period, the share of Hindus fell from 84.1% to 79.8%.\n\nPublicly available census data is consistent with the findings of the new study.\n\nMoreover, the study by the prime minister's advisory council noted that \"globally the share of the majority religious denomination has gone down by approximately 22 percent\". So, the decline of 7.82% in India's Hindu population, according to the study, is significantly lower than the global average.\n\nOn Thursday, Chandrasekhar also raised questions about the reasons for the rise in share of the population of Muslims in India. \"How much of this growth is caused by illegal immigration and conversion?\" he asked.\n\nThe study itself provides no definite answer to the minister's question, even as it notes factors like \"migration, conversion, differences in fertility rates and variation in territorial boundaries\" as reasons for change in the religious compositions of a population.\n\nHowever, it adds: \"We abstract away from the causes of this change and instead focus on the share of the minority population as a cumulative outcome measure of their well-being.\"\n\nThe Pew Research Center study had concluded fertility rates to be the primary driver of population change in India. The fertility rate among Muslims still remains the highest in India. But the National Family Health Survey-5 released in 2022 found that the fertility rate among Muslims has seen the sharpest decline among all religious communities over the past two decades.\n\nThe Population Foundation of India on Thursday noted that \"the decadal growth rate for Muslims had decreased from 32.9% in 1981-1991 to 24.6% in 2001-2011. This decline is more pronounced than that of Hindus, whose growth rate fell from 22.7% to 16.8% over the same period.\"\n\nAs for religious conversion, the Pew Research Center study found that 98% of Indian adults identified with the religion in which they were raised, which shows the lack of impact of conversions on the religious composition.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 99% of people who live in India were also born in India, the study found. This data showed that migration too has hardly had any impact.\n\nChandrasekhar and Trivedi used the study's findings to repeat the false claim that the Congress would introduce reservations on the basis of religion if it came to power. The claim has been repeatedly made by BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at several election rallies.\n\n\"How much of this growth [in Muslim population] is caused by illegal immigration and conversion?\" Chandrasekhar asked on Thursday. \"What is the impact of this increase on the rights of other minority communities? There is a huge attempt by some parties, Congress to alter the Constitution and bring religion-based reservation.\"\n\nThe claim is baseless as the Congress' manifesto neither talks about religion-based reservations, nor has any of its leaders made such announcements.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhik_deb@scroll.in",

It has come from WhatsApp university (a term used to refer to the fake news and misinformation spread in India through WhatsApp).\"\n\nOn the other hand, the BJP said that such dip in Hindu population between 1950 and 2015 is the result of Congress rule.\n\n\"Share of Hindus shrunk 7.8% between 1950 and 2015.

In contrast, the Muslims were 8 per cent, but they are now 15 per cent, according to government report.

They want to make India an Islamic state. It's a big conspiracy,\" he added.\n\nTejashwi Calls Report an 'Agenda of BJP'\n\nRJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, responding to the 'Hindus share decline' report, called it an agenda of the BJP. \"The census which was to be done in 2021-22 did not happen till 2024. They are only talking about misleading the people of the country and spreading hatred among the people.\"\n\n\"This is the agenda of PM Modi and the BJP, they want to cheat the people of the country

Today, Hindus have been reduced to 70 per cent while Muslims have seen rise by many percentage. Data says they are at 14 per cent but I say their population is not less than 20 per cent. If corrective steps are not taken immediately, it will have serious repercussions.\"\n\nAssam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said it was right that country's demography was changing.\n\n\"In every state across the country, Muslim population was on an uptrend while that of Hindus are on a decline. This is a fact based data and there is nothing imaginary about it,\" he said.\n\nUttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya blamed the Congress for unhindered growth of one community at the cost of other.\n\n\"Hindus have seen consistent decline while Muslim population have been soaring. Congress party is to blame for this. It only pursued appeasement of one community and brought no population policy. There is an urgent for Uniform Civil Code,\" he said.\n\nBJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi told IANS that in 1950s, the population of Muslims was comparatively less while the number of learned Muslims was higher.\n\n\"Earlier, their icons were people like Ustaad Bismillah Khan, Ustaad Zakir Hussain, Ghulam Ali while today, people like Zakir Naik, Ishrat Jahan, Yakub Memon, Atiq Ahmed and more have emerged as their representatives. This has much to do with rise in their population,\" he said.\n\n\"The rise in their population resulted in their degradation. Muslim community should introspect into this rather than reacting with anger over findings,\" he added.\n\nBJP spokesperson RP Singh said that there is no doubt that the imbalance in Hindu-Muslim population, as compared to 1950, is the result of bad policies of Congress regimes.\n\n\"They amended and tailored the laws to suit their demands. They gave concessions in Muslim Personal Law and made titled laws, this led to such imbalance,\" he added.\n\nCongress leader Udit Raj, replying to query on the EAC-PM report, slammed the current dispensation for not conducting Census in 2021.\n\n\"Census is due for long. This government is deliberately delaying it. Unless, there is a detailed survey, we won't get to know the real demography,\" he said.\n\nFormer Congress veteran Acharya Pramod Krishnam hit out at the INDIA bloc for plunging numbers of Hindus. He said that the Opposition wants to divide the majority, so that it succeeds in pushing its dangerous agenda. Manu Gaur, the TAXAB president also raised concerns over the changing demography and said that an effective population policy was the need to time to arrest this disparity.\n\nAll India Muslim Jamaat chief Maulana Mufti Shahabuddin Barelvi said that there was not truth in this report.\n\n\"Every community has seen growth in their numbers, over the years. It's understood that those belonging to poor and deprived sections will have bigger families but this can't seen through a religious prism,\" he said.\n\n\"When people get literate and become well-equipped, they tend to limit their numbers as they understand its benefits,\" he said further to prove his point.", "source": {"uri": "ommcomnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ommcom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giriraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Giriraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Civil_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uniform Civil Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhanshu_Trivedi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudhanshu Trivedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Husain_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zakir Husain (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakub_Memon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yakub Memon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keshav_Prasad_Maurya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keshav Prasad Maurya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismillah_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bismillah Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himanta_Biswa_Sarma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himanta Biswa Sarma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Naik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zakir Naik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._P._Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R.

The appeal was issued by Jathedar Giani Harnam Singh Khalsa, the head of Damdami Taksal, a prominent Sikh organization. He urged every Sikh couple to have at least five children and also said that if they cannot afford the expenses of the kids, then the four kids should be handed over to the organisation.\n\nJathedar Giani Harnam Singh Khalsa said that the organisation will nurture and raise all those children. He said that this would help Sikhs increase their population. He also appealed to Sikhs to make their children promote the Sikh religion, said reports.\n\n\"You should not limit yourself to one child, otherwise, in the coming times, Sikhs will be a minority and will suffer.

The report has become a political weapon, with the BJP using it to blame the Congress and the Opposition targeting the government for not conducting the census. The report's timing, amidst elections, has raised suspicions of political manipulation.\n\nOpposition leaders on Thursday accused the BJP of trying to create communal divide over a report that claimed the share of Hindu population in India decreased between 1950 and 2015.\n\nCPI general secretary D Raja and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav slammed the union government for not conducting the census, and called the working paper by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) an attempt to get votes by creating strife.\n\nUnion minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh meanwhile used the report to target the Congress, and alleged that Hindu population in the country has gone down due to its politics of appeasement.\n\nAsked about the report, Yadav said the BJP is trying to spread hatred.\n\n''The census that was to happen in 2020-21 has not been done till now, it's 2024... Their aim is only to mislead the people of the country, and to spread hatred. This is the agenda of prime minister Narendra Modi and BJP. They have fooled people of this country for ten years, and they want to do that again,'' he alleged.\n\nRaja questioned the timing of the report and said, ''Why has the PM's economic advisory council come out with this report at a time when the country is going for elections? The prime minister is already trying to polarise people in the name of Muslims, talking about handing over keys of Ram Mandir to Muslims... he is taking up all such issues. That means there is an attempt to polarise people by bringing out such data. People should be cautious of such reports.'' He said it is a ''study between 1950 and 2015. Mr Modi came to power in 2014. This government has not conducted any census, has not given any data for those who died due to Covid. They have not given any data on migrant workers, or prevailing poverty. But how was this data collected?'' Singh, the Union Rural Development Minister who is fighting from the Begusarai seat in Bihar, said some people want to mislead the nation, but the truth cannot be hidden. ''In 1947, we had around 88 per cent Hindu population, now we are 70 per cent. Muslims were eight per cent, now government figures say they are 15-16 per cent, I would say they are 20 per cent...'' Singh claimed.\n\n''Congress made this country a 'dharmshala' (inn). In 1971, the Bangladeshi infiltrators who came, made India and Bihar a sanctuary for Rohingyas, Bangladeshis... They were converted into a vote bank, it was a conspiracy to finish Sanatan. Now they are giving reservations through the backdoor...,'' he alleged.\n\n''Hindu population is decreasing, Muslim population is increasing... It shows that in the days to come, they want to make India an Islamic state,'' Singh claimed.\n\nAccording to the working paper ''Share of Religious Minorities: A Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)'', share of the Hindu population decreased by 7.82 per cent between 1950 and 2015 (from 84.68 per cent to 78.06 per cent). The share of Muslim population in 1950 was 9.84 per cent and increased to 14.09 per cent in 2015 -- a 43.15 per cent increase in their share, it claimed. The paper said the data indicates that ''there is a conducive environment to foster diversity in the society,'' adding that it is not possible to promote better life outcomes for the disadvantaged sections of society without providing a nurturing environment and societal support through a bottom-up approach.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejashwi_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tejashwi Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Raja", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

The timing of the report raises questions.\"\n\n\"I want to ask the top BJP leaders why didn't they conduct the national census in 2021. Only the census gives the exact parameters of population growth. During the 17-month tenure of the grand alliance in Bihar, we conducted the caste-based survey, in which all castes and religions were included,\" Tiwari added.\n\nBJP spokesperson Arvind Kumar Singh said: \"There is a lack of family planning among the minority community. This is the reason why their population is increasing. Lack of education is another factor. There should be a law for population control in the country that should be strictly implemented.\"\n\nOn the timing of releasing the report, Singh said, \"The government institutions are doing their work. The country is so big that elections keep happening at some place or the other. This report has nothing to do with the Lok Sabha elections.\"\n\nJD-U MLC Neeraj Kumar said: \"The population growth of minorities is not related to religion. It is related to education. Bangladesh's model of population control is considered the best in the world. Bangladesh is a Muslim country and its economy is much smaller than India. So, why do people across the world give an example of Bangladesh when it comes to population control?\"\n\n\"Under the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, we have worked hard on women's education.

The study analysed data spanning from 1950 to 2015.\n\nAccording to the findings, the population share of the majority religion in India, Hindus, experienced a notable decline of 7.8 per cent during the aforementioned period. In contrast, the share of minority religious groups such as Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and Buddhists, increased. However, the study also noted a decrease in the population share of Jains and Parsis.\n\nBetween 1950 and 2015, the Muslim population share in India saw a substantial surge, increasing by 43.15 per cent. Christians experienced a comparatively modest increase of 5.38 per cent, Sikhs witnessed a rise of 6.58 per cent, and Buddhists also observed a slight increase. It's noteworthy that despite the rise in the share of other minority groups, the rise in the share of the Muslim community is in limelight.\n\nAccording to the study, the share of Hindus in India's population has experienced a decline from 84 per cent in 1950 to 78 per cent in 2015. In contrast, the proportion of Muslims has witnessed a notable increase from 9.84 per cent to 14.09 per cent during the same period.\n\nThe study further reveals that this is a global trend. Several countries, including Australia, China, Canada, New Zealand, and certain East African nations, see a decline in the majority community's share of the population and the share has been more pronounced than in India. On a global scale, the study reveals that the share of majority religious denominations in 167 countries has, on average, decreased by 22 per cent from 1950 to 2015. This indicates a substantial demographic transformation occurring worldwide over the past decades.\n\nWhy The Study Is Revealed Amid Elections?\n\nIt is interesting to note that the data is shared when India is going through the 18th Lok Sabha election phases. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are using this data to show themselves as saviours of the Hindu community. They also portray that protecting Hindus means protecting them from Muslims. According to them, the Hindu majority face danger as the opposition Congress party is conspiring with the Muslim community to rob them of their wealth and entitlements.\n\nDuring an election rally in Rajasthan, PM Modi warned the crowd that if the opposition were to come into power, they would allegedly redistribute wealth from Hindus to those \"who have more children,\" a statement widely interpreted as referring to the Muslim community.\n\nIn another campaign event in Rajasthan, PM Modi raised concerns about the Congress party's alleged intentions to give away reservations or quotas in education, employment, and government schemes for backward classes, scheduled castes, and tribal people to the Muslims. This tactic appeared to be aimed at instilling fear among the backward and Dalit sections of the Hindu electorate, potentially influencing their voting preferences in favour of the BJP.\n\nA recent remark by Rashtriya Janata Dal's President, Lalu Prasad Yadav, advocating for 'poora' (complete) reservation for Muslims ignited the flame. PM Modi responded strongly to this remark, citing it as evidence to support his claim that the Congress and INDIA Bloc may allocate reservation benefits to the Muslim community.\n\nDuring a rally in Madhya Pradesh's Dhar, PM Modi expressed concerns over what he perceives as a potential shift of reservation benefits from SC, ST, and OBC to Muslims. PM Modi's remarks alluded to the notion of Muslims having larger families, stating, \"We are five, ours are 25,\" which was interpreted as a reference to Muslim men marrying four times and having more children.\n\nThe ongoing election campaign has taken a concerning turn as PM Modi is framing the election as a battle between Hindus and Muslims. Analysts suggest that the BJP's aggressive rhetoric stems from a sense of desperation following underwhelming support in the initial phase of the elections. In response, the party appears to be resorting to its traditional strategy of Hindu polarisation, stoking fears of a perceived Muslim takeover of India.\n\nThe release of demographic data at this juncture is viewed by some as a calculated move to galvanise support for the BJP in the remaining phases of the election. By leveraging fears of demographic change and emphasising Hindu identity, the party aims to mobilise voters and secure victory in the upcoming phases of the election.\n\nIs This Happening For The First Time?\n\nThe practice of using religion in election campaigns is not new in India, but it is regulated by laws such as the People's Representative Act.\n\nAccording to this law, appeals by candidates or any other person, with the consent of a candidate, to vote or refrain from voting based on religion, race, caste, community, or language, are considered corrupt electoral practices. Violators of this provision can face severe consequences, including up to six years in jail.\n\nThe Act's provisions have been enforced in the past, leading to notable cases such as the six-year election ban imposed in 1999 on Bal Thackeray, the founder of the Shiv Sena party, for his involvement in communal incitement.\n\nWhy ECI Is Silent?\n\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI) has faced criticism for its apparent inaction on the matter. The ECI's compromised status may be a key factor behind its silence, as per the observers. In December, the BJP succeeded in passing legislation in parliament that altered the composition of the selection committee responsible for appointing election commissioners. Previously, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) was part of this committee, alongside the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition. However, under the new legislation, the CJI has been replaced with a minister selected by the Prime Minister.\n\nThis legislative change has raised concerns about the ECI's independence, with critics arguing that it has transformed the commission into a government-controlled entity. Since then, the ECI has been accused of exhibiting a bias in its actions, issuing notices to opposition leaders while failing to take action against BJP leaders for alleged violations.\n\nAs the elections progress, concerns persist over the ECI's ability to fulfil its mandate impartially and ensure fair and transparent elections in India.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType":

The prime minister is already trying to polarise people in the name of Muslims, talking about handing over keys of Ram Mandir to Muslims... he is taking up all such issues. That means there is an attempt to polarise people by bringing out such data. People should be cautious of such reports.\" He said it is a \"study between 1950 and 2015. Mr Modi came to power in 2014.

Muslim community should introspect into this rather than reacting with anger over findings,\" he added.\n\nBJP spokesperson RP Singh said that there is no doubt that the imbalance in Hindu-Muslim population, as compared to 1950, is the result of bad policies of Congress regimes.\n\n\"They amended and tailored the laws to suit their demands. They gave concessions in Muslim Personal Law and made titled laws, this led to such imbalance,\" he added.\n\nCongress leader Udit Raj, replying to query on the EAC-PM report, slammed the current dispensation for not conducting Census in 2021.\n\n\"Census is due for long. This government is deliberately delaying it. Unless, there is a detailed survey, we won't get to know the real demography,\" he said.\n\nFormer Congress veteran Acharya Pramod Krishnam hit out at the INDIA bloc for plunging numbers of Hindus. He said that the Opposition wants to divide the majority, so that it succeeds in pushing its dangerous agenda. Manu Gaur, the TAXAB president also raised concerns over the changing demography and said that an effective population policy was the need to time to arrest this disparity.\n\nAll India Muslim Jamaat chief Maulana Mufti Shahabuddin Barelvi said that there was not truth in this report.\n\n\"Every community has seen growth in their numbers, over the years. It's understood that those belonging to poor and deprived sections will have bigger families but this can't seen through a religious prism,\" he said.\n\n\"When people get literate and become well-equipped, they tend to limit their numbers as they understand its benefits,\" he said further to prove his point.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giriraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Giriraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Civil_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uniform Civil Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudhanshu_Trivedi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudhanshu Trivedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Husain_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zakir Husain (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakub_Memon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yakub Memon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keshav_Prasad_Maurya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keshav Prasad Maurya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismillah_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bismillah Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himanta_Biswa_Sarma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himanta Biswa Sarma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appeasement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Naik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zakir Naik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._P._Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R.

One particular community is increasing population where demography of India is being altered. How much of this growth is caused by illegal immigration and conversion?\"\n\nChandrashekhar also questioned about how the rights of other minority communities will be impacted by this increase. \"There is a huge attempt by some parties, Congress to alter the Constitution and bring religion-based reservation.

Though this report does not explain which religion clocked maximum growth in numbers, it is not difficult to decipher the reason behind this irrational and swift change in religious demography,\" Manu Gaur said, citing the changing population matrix in the Middle-East.\n\nHe further said that India is no exception to this trend and it is not difficult to explain which religion has outgrown whom, at whose cost.\n\n\"As per a report, India and Nepal, both nations have seen surge in minority populations while the neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan have seen consistent decline in minority population there. It's because of this the government was prompted to bring CAA to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from these nations,\" he pointed.\n\nManu Gaur also said that the population explosion is putting a heavy burden on the nation's resources and the time is ripe to bring a population policy to address these challenges.\n\n\"The unprecedented changes in the country's demography is putting a burden on the taxpayers, who mostly belong to the middle and upper-middle class. Today, they are being forced to re-think their tax contributions. They are sending their wards to foreign countries for further studies, who are now settling abroad also,\" he said.\n\n\"Slew of government welfare schemes hinge on taxpayers money. If there are no taxpayers, who would fund the welfare schemes,\" he asked and underscored that there is a pressing need to bring population policy to address these challenges.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian subcontinent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indian subcontinent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Studies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/202405093158665.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549099", "eventUri": "eng-9549099", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

This is what decades of Congress rule did to us. Left to them, there would be no country for Hindus,\" Amit Malviya said on X.\n\nThe comment from the BJP IT head follows a study conducted by the PM's economic council (EAC-PM). The study revealed that the majority population's share in the Hindu population decreased by 7.82 percent between 1950 and 2015, dropping from 84.68 percent to 78.06 percent, while the share of the Muslim population, which in 1950 was 9.84 per cent, increased to 14.09 per cent in 2015--a 43.15 per cent increase in their share.\n\nMeanwhile, Keshav Prasad Maurya, the deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, also blamed the Congress for the decline in the Hindu population and claimed that the Muslim population increased due to the party's policy of appeasing Muslims.\n\n\"This is a topic of concern and this imbalance in the population--rise in Muslim population and decline in Hindu population, has happened because of the Congress' Muslim appeasement,\" ANI quoted Keshav Prasad Maurya as saying.\n\nMaurya added further, \"Congress party worked like the Muslim League and therefore, the country witnessed an imbalance in the population. That is why, the country needs Uniform Civil Code (UCC)... Just like Hindus, Muslims will only marry one person. \"Ye nahi ki ham 5 aur hamare 25 ke formule se santulan bigde,\" and then the demand for another Pakistan rises in the country. To avoid such occurrences, the Uniform Civil Code is crucial.\n\nAccording to the EAC report, the percentage of the Christian population increased from 2.24 per cent to 2.36 per cent, showing a growth of 5.38 per cent between 1950 and 2015.\n\nThe percentage of the Sikh population grew from 1.24 percent in 1950 to 1.85 percent in 2015, showing a 6.58 percent increase in their share. Similarly, the percentage of the Buddhist population saw a significant rise from 0.05 percent in 1950 to 0.81 percent.\n\nThe percentage of Jains in India's population decreased from 0.45 percent in 1950 to 0.36 percent in 2015. The percentage of the Parsi population in India saw a significant 85 percent decline, dropping from 0.03 percent in 1950 to 0.004 percent in 2015.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

With a thorough examination of over 167 countries spanning 65 years, the report presents intriguing findings.\n\nNotably, India's Hindu population decreased by 7.82%, almost 8%, between 1950 and 2015, while the Muslim population saw a remarkable 43.15% increase during the same period.\n\nAmidst these figures, the global media consistently portrays India as a country where Muslims are persecuted. But do these statistics support such perceptions? More importantly, what drives this significant boom in the Muslim population? When we contrast these trends with the stark situations faced by minorities in neighboring countries, such as Bangladesh where the Hindu population declined by 66%, or West Pakistan with an astonishing 80% drop, it begs the question.\n\nMinority communities in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and even Syria, Libya, and Algeria face daunting challenges. However, in India, Muslim minorities are thriving with a notable 43.15% increase in population share. The numbers speak for themselves and this brings us to the five crucila questions:\n\n1. Is a rising Muslim population in India a sign of hope or persecution?\n\n2 - Do Indian Muslims realise that fate of Hindus in Islamic nations causes fears?\n\n3 - Why is India's record questioned on Muslims, not Islamic nations on Hindus?\n\n4 - If education & economic progress reduce fertility rates, will vikas of Indian Muslims balance stabilise numbers?\n\n5 - How do we address those fearing that Muslim population rise is an Islamist demographic change push?\n\nDr. Abbas kicks off by tackling the question head-on: \"What's behind the surge?\" And if there is indeed an explanation, then perhaps the ecosystem isn't as fear-inducing as some may believe.\n\nNow, onto the answer: I've got my doubts about the report that just hit the shelves. Why? Well, the 2021 census was on the agenda, but it's nowhere to be seen yet. If you need confirmation, just swing by and ask PM Modi Ji himself. There's a solid truth in the census report, backed by empirical data, concrete evidence, group formations, intricate formulas, and a meticulously laid-out strategy.\n\nBut here's the kicker: the BJP seems to be on shaky ground in this election battle, so they're resorting to stoking the flames of this Hindu-Muslim divide.\n\nTo Zeenat Shaukat Ali : Is the education factor playing a role, as if it were then there wouldn't be a surplus rise in the population of the community?\n\nHowever, there are multiple aspects to consider. With India being a land of diverse religions, the absence of a census since 2021 raises significant concerns. The postponement of a decentralized census by 150 years adds another layer of complexity. Amidst this backdrop, we encounter yet another report. What does this all mean?\n\nThe discussion at hand certainly isn't about defaming any community. Instead, it's about celebrating the fact that despite neighboring countries like Pakistan, China, and Bangladesh where Muslims face adversity, India stands out. The point you're making, Venet, holds validity. Nevertheless, the world is evolving, and perspectives are shifting.\n\nMD.

For example, the TFR among Muslim women in Kerala is lower than the TFR among Hindu women in Bihar,\" the NGO said.\n\nSuccessful family planning programmes in Muslim-majority countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia have resulted in lower birth rates compared to India. These countries have achieved this through higher levels of female education, greater employment opportunities and better access to contraceptive choices. This clearly shows that fertility decline is influenced by development factors rather than religious affiliation, Population Foundation of India added.\n\n\"The most effective way to manage population growth is through investment in education, economic development and gender equity. Our analysis indicates that women's education is the most critical factor in reducing fertility rates. Therefore, interventions should focus on providing education and family planning services irrespective of religion,\" Muttreja said.\n\nThere are several population issues the world is grappling with.\n\n\"Population Foundation of India urges the media to refrain from using demographic studies to create fear and division. It is essential to present data accurately and contextually, highlighting the role of education, income and socio-economic development in shaping demographic trends. We advocate for policies that promote inclusive development and gender equity to ensure a balanced and harmonious society,\" the NGO said.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news",

But the population of these people will grow on three factors- natural causes, religious conversion, immigration, and polygamy,\" Trivedi told ANI on Thursday.\n\nHitting out to the opposition alliance, Trivedi asked is they intend to provide benefits of reservation to Muslims whose population is increasing by taking away reservation benefits from other sections of the society.\n\n\"I want to ask the INDI alliance leaders if they want to give reservation based on population, will they go on increasing reservation on this ever-growing population?

The Muslim community, on the other hand, experienced a remarkable increase of 43.15%, constituting 14.09% of the total population during the same period.

However, the Jain and Parsi communities faced a decline in their shares, with figures standing at 0.36% and 0.004% respectively during the same period.\n\nReacting to this, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar drew attention to the implications of these demographic shifts, particularly the disproportionate growth of the Muslim community. The Union minister raised questions regarding the factors contributing to this trend and its broader ramifications for India's societal fabric and development trajectory.\n\nTaking to X, Chandrasekhar said, \"This trend of only Muslim community outgrowing other communities and altering demography is a serious issue and leads to many important questions that need to be asked and answered.\"\n\nHe posed inquiries concerning the potential roles of illegal immigration and conversions in driving this demographic change, as well as the impact on other minority communities such as Christians, Sikhs,

Photograph: ANI Photo\n\nAccording to a recent working paper compiled by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, the share of the Hindu population decreased by 7.82 percent between 1950 and 2015 in India, while that of Muslims increased by 43.15 percent, suggesting that there is a conducive environment in the country to foster diversity.\n\nThe study led to a slugfest among political parties, with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party alleging that the \"appeasement politics\" of the Congress-led to the increase in the population of Muslims in the country.\n\nIn a statement, the Population Foundation of India said it is deeply concerned about recent media reports \"misreporting\" the findings from the study to spread alarm regarding the growth of the Muslim population in the country.\n\n\"The study's focus on changes in the share of majority and minority religious groups globally over a 65-year period should not be used to incite fear or discrimination against any community,\" it said.\n\nAccording to census figures, the decadal growth rate for Muslims has been declining over the past three decades.\n\nSpecifically, the decadal growth rate for Muslims decreased from 32.9 percent in 1981-1991 to 24.6 percent in 2001-2011.\n\n\"This decline is more pronounced than that of Hindus, whose growth rate fell from 22.7 to 16.8 percent over the same period,\" the NGO said.\n\nThe census data is available from 1951 to 2011 and is quite similar to the data in this study, indicating that these numbers are not new, the organisation said.\n\nNoting that the TFR among all religious groups is declining, it said the highest decrease in the TFR from 2005-06 to 2019-21 was observed among Muslims, which dropped by 1 percentage point, followed by Hindus at 0.7 percentage point.\n\n\"This trend underscores that the fertility rates are converging across different religious communities,\" it said.\n\nThe NGO, which promotes and advocates for the effective formulation and implementation of gender-sensitive population, health and development strategies and policies, said such interpretations are not only inaccurate but also misleading and baseless.\n\n\"The media's selective portrayal of data to highlight the increase in the Muslim population is an example of misrepresentation that ignores broader demographic trends,\" said Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India.\n\nFertility rates are closely linked to education and income levels, not religion, she added.\n\n\"States with better access to education, healthcare and socio-economic development, such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, exhibit lower TFRs across all religious groups. For example, the TFR among Muslim women in Kerala is lower than the TFR among Hindu women in Bihar,\" the NGO said.\n\nSuccessful family planning programmes in Muslim-majority countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia have resulted in lower birth rates compared to India.\n\nThese countries have achieved this through higher levels of female education, greater employment opportunities and better access to contraceptive choices.\n\nThis clearly shows that fertility decline is influenced by development factors rather than religious affiliation, Population Foundation of India added.\n\n\"The most effective way to manage population growth is through investment in education, economic development and gender equity. Our analysis indicates that women's education is the most critical factor in reducing fertility rates. Therefore, interventions should focus on providing education and family planning services irrespective of religion,\" Muttreja said.\n\nThere are several population issues the world is grappling with.\n\n\"Population Foundation of India urges the media to refrain from using demographic studies to create fear and division. It is essential to present data accurately and contextually, highlighting the role of education, income and socio-economic development in shaping demographic trends. We advocate for policies that promote inclusive development and gender equity to ensure a balanced and harmonious society,\" the NGO said.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news",

For example, the TFR among Muslim women in Kerala is lower than the TFR among Hindu women in Bihar,\" the NGO said.\n\nSuccessful family planning programmes in Muslim-majority countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia have resulted in lower birth rates compared to India. These countries have achieved this through higher levels of female education, greater employment opportunities and better access to contraceptive choices. This clearly shows that fertility decline is influenced by development factors rather than religious affiliation, Population Foundation of India added.\n\n\"The most effective way to manage population growth is through investment in education, economic development and gender equity. Our analysis indicates that women's education is the most critical factor in reducing fertility rates. Therefore, interventions should focus on providing education and family planning services irrespective of religion,\" Muttreja said.\n\nThere are several population issues the world is grappling with.\n\n\"Population Foundation of India urges the media to refrain from using demographic studies to create fear and division. It is essential to present data accurately and contextually, highlighting the role of education, income and socio-economic development in shaping demographic trends. We advocate for policies that promote inclusive development and gender equity to ensure a balanced and harmonious society,\" the NGO said.

Dr Shamika Ravi, Economist, Member, EAC-PM and Author of the latest EAC-PM report on population, spoke to Republic Media Network Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami on the report showing a decline in Hindu population and an increase in the Muslim minority population from 1950 to 2015.\n\nWhen Arnab Goswami asked Shamika if she was expecting this kind of public and trending conversation around the EAC-PM report, Shamika Ravi replied, \"I don't think anyone is surprised with these numbers...maybe the numbers may be new, but the levels and broadly what the changes are, it's not new at all. I think it is the election season perhaps that is making it so exciting. But frankly, these are long-term changes, most economists are familiar with.\"\n\nArnab asked whether a 7.8% decline is a steep fall for any community around the world, and would it mean that around 10 crore or 100 million Hindus are less now as compared to the post-Independence era.\n\n\"These are shares, so in absolute terms, because for every religion, the population is always expanding...we have had a major expansion in the size of every demographic in every religious group. It is the relative share of each religious group and that too, minorities, which becomes an interesting phenomenon,\" said Shamika.\n\nThe economist went on to elaborate, \"What India is following or the experience that India has had over the last 65 years is akin to most Western, liberal, plural democracies, where the share of the majority has gone down and the minority has gone up, contrary to countries of the region. So our neighbourhood, we are quite unique,\" said Shamika Ravi.\n\n\"In India, we have had the second largest decline in the majority population, which is about 7.82 per cent - therefore a commensurate increase in the minority as a group. All other countries in the neighbourhood - Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Afghanistan - have all had an alarming decline in the proportion of the share of minorities. In that sense, there is a novelty to this research,\" explained Shamika Ravi.\n\nOn Asaduddin Owaisi's claims of 'WhatsApp University' report on the population\n\nArnab went on to ask Shamika on her reaction to All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi's claims of the EAC-PM report being from 'WhatsApp University', meaning it was fictitious.\n\nTo which, Shamika replied, \"It's a report by three researchers using publicly available data. I'm a little surprised it has surprised people. I'm also surprised that it has taken us time to do analysis on things which are so obvious and that we should be doing on a routine basis.\"\n\n'India should regularly measure population'\n\nThe eminent economist went on to explain that India is one of the few countries that have a dedicated ministry for minorities, and therefore a study is incumbent.\n\n\"There are very few countries that actually define minorities or are interested in the protection of minorities. But India has followed these UN (United Nations) norms, these progressive, modern norms. In fact, we are one of the very few countries that have a dedicated ministry for minorities. Now, given the kind of policy priority minority welfare has, given the kind of resources that are spent, don't we want to assess what the outcomes are? So, why is it that we are not measuring these realities on the ground? In fact, this should become a regular, routine exercise. It should really not be left to interest. And that is what it is.\"\n\nWhat is the finding on the plight of Muslims of India?\n\nArnab sought Shamika's opinion on whether the plight of Muslims should also be measured. People may say that the EAC-PM has a vested interest in the report. Is it a stilted perspective?\n\n\"We do have other studies that have looked at availability of amenities, even development indicators across religious and social groups, etc. So, what you're calling 'plight', I think we have to put an objective variable, which can be measured. The condition of most minority groups has improved dramatically,\" said Shamika.\n\nShe added, \"Now, Why don't we look at the share of the minority population? It's the final outcome metric. In a discriminatory environment, when you have not just policies but generally a community or a society, which is leading to the plight of any one group or another, or minorities in general, (then) you're not going to see a significant increase in population. As is the case in many countries, and particularly in our neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"So, it's a very good composite metric. It's a very good variable,\" Shamika further elaborated, adding, \"Just like, if you have a very skewed sex ratio, we know that women are being discriminated against. So, I think that there is a scientific basis to say that these are objective measures and we must look at it.\"\n\nWhat are the drivers of change in population share?\n\nShamika Ravi spoke about an important point to be looked at in this scenario. \"But one important point to make is that, we are not looking at drivers of this change, as to what is leading to the changes in share of population will not just include fertility rates and birth rates... It's the difference in the rates that will eventually determine the share.\" Shamika added that it is a very sophisticated point that is important for people to understand.\n\nIs Conversion the reason for decline in Hindu population in India?\n\nShamika spoke about factors like migration and conversion in population change. She explained, \"But also migration - illegal or illegal - and then conversion. You see, in Europe, most countries have seen a decline in majority religion on account of mass migration. But in Africa, 24 countries used to have Animism as the majority religion. In 65 years, none of these 24 countries have Animism as the majority religion. So, now we are not talking of birth rate or migration, we are talking conversion. And obviously, it is a combination of all these factors that is leading to the final outcome. This paper (the EAC-PM report) is the first step to put out objectively, Step Number 1. Now we need to look more into the details.\"\n\nThe EAM-PC said on X about the report, \"India has seen the second most significant decline in the majority population (7.82%), only next to Myanmar (10%) within the immediate South Asian neighbourhood. Minority populations have shrunk substantially in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan.\"", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"},

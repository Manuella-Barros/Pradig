EC stated that if the postal ballot declaration is signed by the gazetted officer and has no seal, it will not be treated as invalid. Whether the voter cast his or her vote correctly on the ballot paper should be checked.The CEO said the postal ballots bearing the signature of the RO are valid. Form 13A should be signed by the RO along with all the details. He instructed that the ballot including the signature of the RO should be compared with the validating register. He said Form 13A may be rejected if voter, RO signature and ballot serial number are missing. The general elections were held on May 13 across AP with a poll percentage of 81.89.

But Bad Bunny is learning that doesn\u2019t quite work in sports. Since April, the \u201cBaticano\u201d rapper\u2019s sports agency, Rimas Sports, has been engulfed in a heated legal battle with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). According to Billboard, on June 5, things were dialed up a notch. In a new filing, the MLBPA outlined several alleged \u201cegregious and systemic violations\u201d to combat Rimas Sports\u2019 discrimination and being targeted by a \u201cpre-determined investigation\u201d claim. The motion stated that its decision to ban the agency was due to its supposed findings that Rimas gave out improper gifts to players such as VIP concert tickets, granted suite access to prospects at outside sporting events, and extended interest-free loan offers. \u201cThe regulations strictly forbid such inducements,\u201d wrote the union\u2019s lawyers. \u201cPlayer agents must compete for clients based on the quality of their representation, not the quality of their gifts.\u201d The representative went on to outline how if the agency\u2019s alleged actions were left unpunished, it could cause damage across the league. \u201cImmunizing Rimas from the consequences of its own bad conduct will harm players and other player agents by encouraging player-player agent relationships borne out of perquisites, not performance,\u201d the rep wrote. \u201cWhat Rimas seeks is a get out of jail free card for itself. The public has no interest in such an outcome. This kind of conduct became culture at Rimas.\u201d The agency has not yet responded to MLBPA\u2019s latest motion. However, last month, attorneys for Rimas did issue a statement regarding the union\u2019s initial ruling. \u201cThe \u2018good ole boy\u2019 order of baseball sports agency \u2026 was being put at risk, as these Puerto Rican \u2018outsiders\u2019 were disrupting baseball sports agency order too much, too fast,\u201d wrote Rimas attorneys. \u201cThis was something that the MLBPA and Rimas Sports\u2019 competitors would not allow.\u201d Rimas\u2019 went on to refer to the \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented\u201d measures from the MLBPA as a \u201cdeath penalty\u201d on its operations. Rimas claimed the ruling killed its deal with then prospect client Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. Those actions being, as outlined by Billboard as, decertification of one of its agent, preventing co-owner and Bad Bunny\u2019s longtime manage Noah Assad from applying for certification, and blocking already certified sports agents from coming aboard the team. While the MLBPA appears to be stern in its decision, it doesn\u2019t appear this legal fight is over.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bad-bunny.jpeg?w=1024&amp;h=436&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"bad bunny\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bad-bunny.jpeg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bad-bunny.jpeg?resize=300,128 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bad-bunny.jpeg?resize=704,300 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bad-bunny.jpeg?resize=768,327 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tThe sports union believes its findings are a home run to help close the case for good.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/music/mlb-bad-bunny-sports-agency-egregious-systemic-violations-filing/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bad-bunny.jpeg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:21:04", "author": "Flisadam Pointer", "authors": ["Flisadam Pointer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.331}

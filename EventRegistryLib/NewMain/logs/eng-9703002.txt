This indicates that while the sector is still growing, it's doing so at a slower pace than previous months.\n\nThe headline score, closely monitored by economists, exceeded expectations but was the lowest since November of the previous year. A score above 50.0 signifies an increase in activity, which has been the case for eight consecutive months. However, momentum waned in June, with firms reportedly reluctant to commit to new spending and projects before Thursday's election.\n\nJoe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, commented: \"We are seeing some evidence of a pre-General Election seize-up across the UK services economy, with growth in business activity slowing to a seven-month low in June as the prospect of a change in government led to the adoption of a 'wait-and-see' approach by some, restraining sales.\"\n\nThe survey suggested that some companies were holding off on placing orders and commissioning new projects until they had a clearer picture of the incoming government. The vast services sector, which makes up about 80% of the country's total economic output, also accounts for its employment.\n\nThe PMI survey, covering sectors such as hospitality, entertainment and culture, finance and insurance, as well as real estate and business services, highlighted some intriguing economic trends. From April to June, the research found an average score of 53.3, a small drop from the 53.7 recorded from January to March, according to Mr Hayes.\n\nHe indicated that, according to these figures, the nation is \"on track for another quarter of GDP (gross domestic product) growth\", but it might lack the same impact as the first quarter's growth.\n\nOfficial numbers put the economic growth at 0.7% in the first three months of the year, thus ending the brief recession experienced towards the end of 2023. A noteworthy finding of the survey was a slight acceleration in sales growth from overseas customers, especially customers based in North America and Europe.\n\n\"Prices still continue to show a high degree of stickiness across the UK service sector, although input cost inflation once again trended lower in June,\" noted Mr Hayes.\n\nHowever, there could be cause for concern as he pointed out signs that businesses are increasing their prices due to better economic conditions. This will certainly be a key consideration for Bank of England policymakers when deciding on interest rates.\n\nCurrently, policymakers are keen to ensure inflation maintains its target level before contemplating any rate cuts.

However, the bank said that in order to continue easing the rate, it needs to see evidence of stably lowering inflation.\n\nThe economic recovery has been sluggish since the end of last year, when the economy entered a technical recession. Mr. Taylor said that economic recovery could motivate more companies to raise their prices.\n\nElsewhere, the survey recorded a slight pick-up in sales growth from non-domestic customers.

A reading of 50 separates growth in business activity from contraction.\n\nHayes said the evidence from the PMI surveys suggested Britain's economy was on track for another quarter of growth in the three months to the end of June, \"albeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter's 0.7%\".\n\nOfficial figures showed that the UK economy exited recession in the first three months of the year, after a shallow downturn in the second half of 2023 as households cut their spending amid the cost of living crisis and higher Bank of England interest rates.\n\nRob Wood, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the PMI would \"likely bounce back\" after the general election as businesses and households resume spending, with the wait-and-see approach expected to fade away.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_partington@theguardian.com", "name": "Richard Partington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hayes_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Hayes (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tories_(British_political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tories (British political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d29fe8f8d03927bb5180421dd9a2d3c7477e1216/13_153_3950_2370/master/3950.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=eae621145587487a280afb8bcd2b1455", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703002", "eventUri": "eng-9703002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

positive mood on the final day of election campaigning, with most investors looking forward to the installation of a Labour government with a large majority, providing stability and removing political

economy a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\n\"Prominent among today's gainers have been miners, boosted by a weaker dollar and rallying commodity prices.\"\n\nBeauchamp said that while US markets had started the session quietly thanks to poor ADP payrolls and ISM numbers, stocks in Europe were continuing to roar higher.\n\n\"As expected, a swathe of candidates in the French elections have stood down, allowing for a united front against the far right.\n\n\"While this means France is set for a period of political deadlock, it does mean that neither left nor right will have the upper hand.\n\n\"In the short-to-medium term, this should help European equities to keep moving higher, though the longer-term view is less encouraging.\"\n\nUS jobs data, UK services sector in focus\n\nIn economic news, fresh figures from the US Department of Labor showed an increase in initial jobless claims in the US.\n\nFor the week ended 29 June, claims rose by 4,000 to 238,000 from the prior week's revised level of 234,000.\n\nThat kept claims near the 10-month high of 243,000 recorded earlier in June.\n\nContinuing claims also increased by 26,000 to 1.85 million, with the four-week moving average rising by 2,250 to 238,500, highlighting ongoing labour market challenges.\n\nPrivate sector employment in the US meanwhile saw a less-than-expected rise in June, according to ADP.\n\nEmployment grew by 150,000 jobs, falling short of the anticipated 165,000, while May's figures were revised up slightly to 157,000 from 152,000.\n\nJob gains were noted primarily in medium-sized businesses, which added 88,000 positions.\n\nThe service sector contributed significantly with 136,000 new jobs, whereas the goods-producing sector added 14,000 jobs.\n\nHowever, the rate of annual pay increases for job-stayers slowed to 4.9%, the slowest since August 2021, with pay gains for job-changers also decelerating to 7.7%.\n\n\"Job growth has been solid, but not broad-based,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.\n\n\"Had it not been for a rebound in hiring in leisure and hospitality, June would have been a downbeat month.\"\n\nOn another note, the Institute for Supply Management reported a sharp slowdown in US services sector activity for June.\n\nThe services PMI fell to 48.8 from May's 53.8, against expectations of 52.5.\n\nKey subindices showed declines, with production dropping from 61.2 to 49.6, new orders from 54.1 to 47.3, and employment from 47.1 to 46.1.\n\nPrice pressures slightly eased, with the price subindex decreasing from 58.1 to 56.3.\n\n\"Alongside a decline in the ISM manufacturing index, these surveys suggest that GDP growth will remain weak in the third quarter,\" said Olivia Cross, North America economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\"They also add to evidence that labour demand is softening, and inflation will remain on a downward trend.\"\n\nOn home shores, the growth rate in the UK services sector softened in June, influenced by the upcoming general election.\n\nThe S&P Global UK services PMI business activity index declined to 52.1 from May's 52.9, the slowest growth since November.\n\nThe composite output index, which includes both services and manufacturing, fell to 52.3 from 53.0 in May.\n\nRespondents indicated a slowdown in new business and job creation, as clients waited for the election outcome before making decisions.\n\n\"We are seeing some evidence of a pre-general election seize-up across the UK services economy, with growth in business activity slowing to a seven-month low in June,\" said Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Nevertheless, we're on track for another quarter of GDP growth, according to the composite PMI data ... albeit one that will be less punchy than the first quarter's 0.7%.\n\n\"The recovery of the UK economy from its late 2023 lull adds another dynamic for policymakers to consider, should strong economic conditions motivate more companies to raise their prices.\"\n\nThe eurozone meanwhile experienced a slowdown in growth for June, driven by a weak manufacturing sector.\n\nThe HCOB eurozone services PMI was revised to 52.8, slightly up from the initial 52.6 but down from May's 53.2, marking a three-month low.\n\nThe composite PMI, combining services and manufacturing data, fell to 50.9 from 52.2 in May, indicating softer growth across the region.\n\nFinally on data, China's services sector growth also eased, hitting an eight-month low in June.\n\nThe Caixin services PMI dropped to 51.2 from 54.0 in May, below the expected 53.4.\n\nDespite that, the index remained above the 50.0 threshold that signifies expansion, although at a reduced pace.\n\nThe firm highlighted that with earnings and valuation metrics bottoming out and destocking headwinds likely diminishing, positive earnings momentum is expected in 2025.\n\nCiti anticipated that Diageo's upcoming 2024 results in July would be a pivotal event, encouraging investors to reconsider the company's long-term growth potential.\n\nBaltic Classifieds Group saw a substantial increase of 4.36% after reporting a 20% jump in full-year EBITDA and a 19% rise in revenue.\n\nThe company attributed the strong financial performance to robust growth across its various business lines.\n\nVodafone Group edged up 0.29% after the company and Virgin Media O2 announced an extension and enhancement of their existing mobile network sharing agreement for over a decade.\n\nThe agreement included plans for a new company that would invest \u00a311bn in the project, contingent on the merger of Vodafone and Three.\n\nDirect Line Insurance Group reversed earlier losses to close up 0.87%, despite Berenberg lowering its price target for the stock.\n\nThe bank cautioned that the risk of disappointment for investors was rising.\n\nWizz Air Holdings gained 0.29% following the departure of its president, Robert Carey, prompting a senior management reshuffle.\n\nCarey, who joined Wizz in 2021 from easyJet, left to pursue other interests.\n\nThe bank reduced the price target to 3,192p from 3,246p, noting that the risk/reward balance has become more neutral following a strong performance.\n\nDespite 3i's appeal due to strong assets, the valuation nearing historical peaks and anticipated modest growth led to the downgrade.\n\nOutside the FTSE 350, Keywords Studios rose 2.67% after announcing a takeover by European private equity firm EQT in a deal valued at \u00a32.1bn.", "source": {"uri": "sharecast.com",

Up ahead, Sha'Carri Richardson roared to gold for the United States while shooting the most lingering of looks towards Neita as she crossed the line.\n\nFlash back to the start and Asher-Smith had given Team GB an excellent start in the outside lane, running brilliantly out of the blocks to surge into an early lead. Imani Lansiquot continued her momentum but the following two baton changes may have proved costly. Lansiquot stalled passing to Amy Hunt, and then Neita spent an age with her arm outstretched approaching the final straight.\n\n\"No frustrations at all,\" Neita said. \"It's a relay and anything can happen and in amongst all the chaos we remained professional, got the job done and got the baton round.\n\n\"That's what it's all about because it's a relay and anything can happen, it's really not guaranteed. We came in in a really strong position and we left with a medal and I think we should be really proud of ourselves.\"\n\nNeita's burst over the final 100m may have saved a medal, but it was not enough to catch Richardson - an Olympic champion at last after her surprise defeat to Julien Alfred in the 100m final.\n\nThe USA's joy turned into disaster, however, in the men's 4x100m relay as Christian Coleman crashed into the back of Kenny Bendarek on the opening change, taking the favourites out of contention immediately before they were later disqualified. It opened the door to an outsider and Canada took full advantage. Andre de Grasse led a stirring charge for gold on the final straight ahead of a jubilant South Africa and Great Britain, with Zharnel Hughes roaring Team GB into medal position on the anchor leg.\n\nThe men's relay team had their silver medal stripped from Tokyo after CJ Ujah failed a doping test, but Paris finally delivered an Olympic medal for Hughes, who was part of the quartet denied by Ujah's violation. Hughes was sensational in taking Great Britain from sixth into third following legs from Jeremiah Azu, Louie Hinchliffe and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake.\n\nHinchliffe, who was in the lane next to the chaos involving the USA, was sparkling over the back straight. \"You could see it was a really messy race but we gave all of it,\" he said. \"It was all heart, all pure speed and we gave 110 per cent. You could see how much we wanted it and we got the result so it's great.\"\n\nBut bronze in the men's relay perhaps should have followed gold for in the women's race. Paris had been a difficult Olympics for Asher-Smith and Neita, Team GB's two biggest sprinting stars.\n\nAsher-Smith failed to reach the 100m final and was fourth in the 200m final, missing out on the podium by 0.01s, Neita was fourth in the 100m and fifth in the 200m, falling short on both occasions by less than 0.05s. Both Asher-Smith and Neita had already won bronze in the 4x100m in Rio and Tokyo.

Hughes was sensational to take Great Britain from sixth into third following legs from Jeremiah Azu, Louie Hinchliffe and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake. Hinchliffe, who was in the lane next to the chaos involving the USA, was sparkling over the back straight.\n\nBut bronze for in the men's relay perhaps should have followed gold for in the women's race. Paris had been a difficult Olympics for Asher-Smith and Neita, Team GB's two biggest sprinting stars. Asher-Smith failed to reach the 100m final and was fourth in the 200m final, missing out on the podium by 0.01s, Neita was fourth in the 100m and fifth in the 200m, falling short on both occasions by less than 0.05s. Both Asher-Smith and Neita had already won bronze in the 4x100m in Rio and Tokyo. Silver was an upgrade, but it could have been more.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryll_Neita", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daryll Neita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Asher-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dina Asher-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imani-Lara_Lansiquot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imani-Lara Lansiquot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zharnel_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zharnel Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Azu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremiah Azu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Ujah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CJ Ujah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethaneel_Mitchell-Blake", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anchor leg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/7496d46b282afd2d5d1db1bde4c83573", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805325", "eventUri": "eng-9805325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It was the first of two British sprint relay medals on a satisfying night full of strong individual performances, the men holding on for bronze after seeing a Noah Lyles-less US disqualified for a botched baton change.\n\nA spate of torrential rain proved no barrier to a third straight Olympic medal in this discipline for Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita, the latter coming close to securing the title during a dramatic finish. They were briefly made to sweat on an appeal from one of their opponents in the hour afterwards, seemingly on account of a messy final changeover, but could reflect on an exhilarating performance once that had been dismissed.\n\n\"We've worked so hard for this so to be challenging not just for a medal but challenging for a gold is phenomenal,\" said Asher-Smith, who had set off first for the British team. \"I wanted to set up the ladies for a phenomenal run. We have pushed so hard for the last 10 years. To stand on the podium with everyone is a very beautiful moment.\"\n\nAsher-Smith, Neita, Imani Lansiquot and Amy Hunt performed exceptionally to finish 0.07sec behind the US and, with a cleaner handover between Hunt and Neita, may have taken an astonishing victory. They certainly had the pace, Asher-Smith leading them out of the blocks blisteringly from lane eight and Lansiquot ensuring they were in the driving seat halfway through with a second leg time of 10.13.\n\nBut Gabrielle Thomas, who became 200m champion on Tuesday, made up ground on Hunt and Great Britain would require near-perfection to hold Sha'carri Richardson off on the final straight. They could not quite achieve it, the transfer taking too long and Richardson capitalising three lanes inside. Neita looked quick enough for a winning dash to the line had things gone smoothly but, despite running a fine anchor leg, could not quite make it tell.\n\n\"There was so much chaos going on,\" Hunt said of the changeovers. Nevertheless it was an exceptional result that improved on bronzes earned at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. Asher-Smith and Neita were in both of those quartets, Lansiquot joining them in Japan.\n\nThe men's 4x100m bronze was Great Britain's first medal in that event since the stunning gold secured at Athens 2004. Jeremiah Azu, Louie Hinchliffe, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Zharnel Hughes smelled blood on the final leg; Hughes ran a brilliant split of 8.78 but similarly rapid finishes from Canada and South Africa, who were first and second respectively, told in the final 50 metres.\n\n\"It was a really messy race but we gave all of it,\" said Hinchliffe, who ran the second leg. \"It was all heart, all pure speed and we gave 110%. You could see how much we wanted it and we got the result so it's great.\"\n\nThe US, for whom the 100m champion and 200m bronze medalist Lyles did not participate after revealing he had Covid-19, saw their race end early after Christian Coleman appeared to collide with his teammate Kenny Bednarek on the first handover.\n\nThere were feelings of pride, tinged with a little regret, for Amber Anning after finishing fifth in the women's 400 metres. Anning began and finished strongly but sagged in the middle 200m, never quite looking like sustaining a challenge. Her time of 49.29 was a British record but was no rival to the Olympic record set by Marileidy Paulino, who was runner-up in Tokyo. Paulino, from Dominican Republic, ran clear in 48.17 and beat the time achieved by Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec at Atlanta 96 by 0.08.\n\n\"I'm absolutely blessed,\" Anning said. \"I'm a little bit disappointed. You know what, I wanted to come away with three things. It was either a medal, a PB or a national record and I got one of them.\n\n\"It was tough, I think I let myself have too much work coming into home straight but I just used my strength. I said I wanted to be an Olympic finalist and put myself in contention for a medal so I really can't complain.\"\n\nEilish McColgan and Megan Keith recorded finishes of 15th and 23rd in a women's 10,000m final won by Kenya's Beatrice Chebet. There was concern when the French runner Alessia Zarbo collapsed on the track shortly before the 25-minute mark. She required treatment from medical personnel while the event continued around her and was eventually taken away on a stretcher.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We're skilled, we're smart ladies and we made sure we got in it and I'm so proud of these ladies.\"\n\nThe men's quartet of Jeremiah Azu, Louie Hinchcliffe, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Zharnel Hughes, meanwhile, ran a season's best 37.61seconds in what became a wide open race after a mix-up between Christian Coleman and Kenny Bednarek on America's first change.\n\nBritain had finished second in Tokyo, just one-hundredth of a second behind Italy, but were later disqualified after CJ Ujah tested positive for a banned substance. Mitchell-Blake and Hughes were both part of that team, while Richard Kilty will also receive a redemptive medal having run in the heats in Paris.\n\nHughes skipped the opening round having been forced out of the individual 200m with a hamstring problem and revealed he only was only given the go-ahead to race the final on Thursday night.\n\n\"My hamstring is heavily strapped,\" he said. \"It was a risk but I was willing to take it. I was willing to take it because it was the home straight. In the 200m I couldn't because it's on my outside leg, so me coming around the bend would have snapped it.\n\n\"The job's done.

To find out that I got the gold in that moment, it was just truly incredible.\n\n\"I've been training for this moment my whole life, and now I've just won. To say it hasn't sunk in is an understatement.\n\n\"I don't really know what to think right now, but I imagine later, there's just going to be a flood of emotions. It's a goal I've been training towards for 10 years, basically. Just no words.\"\n\nRoberts later added: \"To find out you've won Olympic gold is definitely a shock. It was a rush of adrenaline, emotion and then happiness.\n\n\"I hope this makes climbing bigger and bigger. The sport is growing in the UK with climbing gyms opening up, and it's so cool to see climbing on this big stage.\"\n\nAt the Stade de France, Katarina Johnson-Thompson laid it all on the line to secure heptathlon silver for her first Olympic medal.\n\nThe Liverpudlian sat 121 points behind Belgian champion Nafissatou Thiam entering the final event, the 800m.\n\nShe faced a nearly impossible task, needing to beat Thiam by more than eight seconds to surpass her main rival.\n\nJohnson-Thompson clocked a personal best 2:04.90, but it was not quite enough as she finished 36 points behind Thiam, who has now twice successfully defended her Olympic title.\n\nA big late charge from Barker saw Britain win the last of the 12 sprints in the 120-lap race and move above the Netherlands as Italy's Chiara Consonni and Vittoria Guazzini celebrated gold.\n\nItaly finished with 37 points to Britain's 31 and the Netherlands' 28.\n\nThe British pair had been on the attack from the off, winning the first sprint and staying in the medal positions for the rest of the race.\n\nThey took the most points of any team purely from the sprints, but Italy and the Netherlands both gained a lap on the field, picking up 20 points in the process.\n\nEvans said: \"It's an Olympic silver medal. That is fantastic.\n\n\"But as world champions we came in with really high expectations, we wanted to win and we felt we were in a really good position and there was an attack that went that we weren't 100 per cent ready for and by the time we responded there was a different race dynamic.\n\n\"We gave it everything and I think on reflection we'll be so proud of the ride we did. But at the same time when you come for gold it's like, eurgh, not quite. But still, silver.\"\n\nDame Laura Kenny and Katie Archibald became the first female Olympic champions at the Tokyo Games when the Madison made its debut in the women's programme. Barker and Evans are the reigning world champions after their win in Glasgow last summer.\n\nDina Asher-Smith, Imani Lansiquot, Amy Hunt and Daryll Neita won silver in the women's 4x100m relay.\n\nTeam GB won bronze in the same event for the last two Olympics and were one of the favourites on Friday night.\n\nThey looked like they might be on course to secure gold before a messy handover between Hunt and anchor Neita cost them time.\n\nThe United States' Sha'Carri Richardson took full advantage to pip the Brits to the line by seven one-hundredths of a second in 41.78.\n\nAsher-Smith said: \"We are all so proud and so happy. We have worked so hard for this, so to be able to be in a position not just to challenge for a medal, but also for gold, it's phenomenal.\n\n\"I tried to get to Imani first and I wanted to set up the ladies for a phenomenal run. I did not want anybody else in sight.\n\n\"I love how the championships are giving medals and the full squad to have their moment. This is a team effort.\n\n\"We have worked so hard as a women'ss team relay squad since 2012, we have pushed so hard for the last ten years. To stand on the podium with everyone is a very beautiful moment.\"\n\nJeremiah Azu, Louie Hinchliffe, Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Zharnel Hughes sealed bronze in the men's 4x100m relay.\n\nHughes, who had pulled out of the men's individual 200m due to hamstring tightness, returned to anchor a line-up also featuring Azu, Hinchliffe and Mitchell-Blake.\n\nIt was a season's best for the British men's quartet in 37.61, who finished behind Canada, champions in 37.50, and South Africa, who claimed silver.\n\nJack Carlin won an eventful individual sprint bronze for Great Britain, edging out Dutchman Jeffrey Hoogland in a deciding race that had to be restarted after the pair collided.\n\nCarlin was already racing on a warning after his tetchy quarter-final with Kaiya Ota on Thursday, and raised his hand in apology after veering up the track and into Hoogland.\n\nThe commissaires decided there was no need for any punishment and the race was restarted, with Carlin having the power to hold off Hoogland down the straight to take his second medal of the week after team sprint silver.\n\nIn the women's 3m springboard, Britain's Yasmin Harper came fifth and compatriot Grace Reid 10th as China won their seventh gold from seven in the diving events in Paris.\n\nChen Yiwen - who also won the synchronised 3m title with Chang Yani on the opening day of the Games - registered a score of 376.00 to finish ahead of Australia's Maddison Keeney (343.10) and countrywoman Chang (318.75).\n\nHarper (305.10) was unable to add to the bronze she claimed alongside Scarlett Mew Jensen in the 3m synchro event.\n\nPlus, Great Britain's Hector Pardoe came sixth in the men's 10km open water swimming after pipping France's Marc-Antoine Olivier in a photo finish, while Ireland's Daniel Wiffen, who won 800m freestyle gold and 1500m bronze in the pool, finishing 18th as he made his debut in open water swimming.\n\nHungary's Kristof Rasovszky took open water gold with a time of one hour 50 minutes

She was fired by MTV in 2019 after he shot and killed their family dog.\n\nThe network had already cut ties with Eason a year prior after he posted a barrage of homophobic and transphobic tweets.\n\nIn March, Evans revealed her legal separation from Eason -- with whom she shares daughter Ensley, 7 -- in a TikTok post soundtracked by Lady Gaga's 2013 single \"Applause.\"\n\n\"Can I get some appreciation? I filed for separation,\" she wrote at the time, adding the caption, \"New Chapter Unlocked \ud83d\udd12\u2728,\" perhaps hinting at her new role on \"Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.\"\n\nThe mom of three -- who also shares son Jace, 14, with ex Andrew Lewis and son Kaiser, 9, with former fianc\u00e9e Nathan Griffith -- explained in a follow-up post that she had to file for separation before divorce because she lives in North Carolina, where couples must be legally separated for a year and have two separate addresses before proceedings can begin.\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates...\n\nEvans memorably made a solo cameo on \"Teen Mom: The Next Chapter\" -- which consolidated \"Teen Mom OG\" and \"Teen Mom 2\" -- in 2022's inaugural season, for which she attended a party hosted by her pal Dejesus, 29.\n\nAround that time, the MTV stalwart -- who appeared on 2010's \"16 & Pregnant\" Season 2 before rising to fame on its \"TM2\" spinoff -- was reportedly asked to return to the franchise, though she declined.\n\nAccording to Evans' manager, MTV wanted to sign the star to an exclusive deal that \"would have limited other career opportunities\" for her -- including a \"new dynamic series in development\" that was seemingly scrapped.\n\nLast year, Evans' former co-star Leah Messer told Page Six that she would love to have her back on the show -- even if the women have drifted apart in recent years.\n\n\"I think that I'm eager to see where she's at in her life and whatever ultimately the executives decide is what they decide. I wish her the very best,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to Evans' return, \"Teen Mom\" alum Mackenzie McKee is rejoining the cast for the sophomore edition of \"The Next Chapter.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dejesus, Messer, Catelynn Lowell, Jade Cline, Cheyenne Floyd, Ashley Jones, Maci Bookout and Amber Portwood are all back.\n\n\"Teen Mom: The Next Chapter\" Season 2 premieres Monday, May 30, at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_McKee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mackenzie McKee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Portwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amber Portwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catelynn_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catelynn Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maci_Bookout", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maci Bookout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_and_Pregnant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "16 and Pregnant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pink Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/81430174.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 3458, "textEnd": 3464}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Sources alleged that the production team was afraid to work with David, which led to Jenelle's departure from the long-running reality show.\n\nHowever, with reports of Jenelle's split from David surfacing, it seems MTV is ready to bring her back into the fold. So, the burning question remains: Is Jenelle Evans back on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter? Read on to find out!\n\nAlright, the moment you've all been waiting for: Jenelle Evan is coming back to the Teen Mom franchise! The mother of three announced her return on May 8, 2024, revealing that she will appear in the spinoff series, Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.\n\nIn a photo shared by Jenelle via Instagram, she is seen seated in what looks like the pilot's seat of a plane, flashing a smile while taking a photo of the cameraman with her phone.\n\nA production insider noted that slots on Next Chapter are highly sought after, and other candidates were under consideration. But, ultimately, Jenelle secured the job.\n\n\"Some of the girls probably saw it coming, though,\" another source commented. \"They knew when Jenelle dumped David that MTV would come calling. But I think most of them assumed [Jenelle] would be put on Teen Mom: Family Reunion and not Next Chapter. To have her go right to [Next Chapter] is kind of a slap in the face to some of the other girls.\"\n\nIn 2022, Jenelle made a cameo in the first season of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter. During that time, she reportedly received an invitation to rejoin the franchise, which she declined.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2022, Jenelle's manager, August Keen, disclosed to TMZ that she wouldn't be returning to the Teen Mom franchise due to a contractual disagreement. MTV allegedly wanted to sign Jenelle to an exclusive deal, but her manager argued it would restrict other career opportunities.", "source": {"uri": "distractify.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Distractify"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allison_degrushe@distractify.com", "name": "Allison DeGrushe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_Family_Reunion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: Family Reunion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

While Evans hasn't appeared on TV since that is apparently about to change. Last week, rumors began swirling that Evans is set to appear in Teen Mom: The Next Chapter now that she is divorcing Eason. Apparently, not everyone who appears on the show is comfortable with the situation.\n\nJenelle Evans might be headed back to MTV. She is rumored to be appearing in Teen Mom: The Next Chapter soon, but it isn't a happy situation for everyone. According to the Ashley Reality Roundup Group, not everyone associated with Teen Mom: The Next Chapter is happy about Evans' rumored return. Most people, including her soon-to-be- costars, were kept in the dark about the controversial reality TV star returning to the franchise. The insider claims the cast was informed after Evans' name was added to the cast list, and she was spotted spending time with a cast member.\n\nAccording to a production source who spoke with the publication, Evans is returning, but some of her coworkers are concerned that other, less troubled stars have been passed over in favor of Evans. They did not mention which costars are unhappy about the situation, but Briana DeJesus seems thrilled. She was the one star spotted spending time with Evans recently. They were fast friends when the two appeared on Teen Mom 2 together.\n\nThe insider also claimed that several other former stars were being considered for a role in the series. The insider did not reveal which former Teen Mom stars were passed up in favor of Evans. Still, only a few have walked away from the franchise willingly. Kailyn Lowry, who had a rather epic falling out with Evans and DeJesus, was one of them. Lowry has not mentioned any interest in returning to MTV.\n\nWhile the insider insists Evans will be returning to the small-screen, it is unclear just how large her role will be. Evans may return as a full-time cast member, but it's equally likely she'll reenter the fold as a friend or a side character.\n\nEvans' catchup with Briana DeJesus would indicate that the mother of three will be brought back slowly and may not immediately garner her own storyline. Surely, there are stipulations attached to her return, as well. It is unclear what those stipulations would be, though.\n\nTeen Mom: The Next Chapter has not been the ratings juggernaut MTV hoped it would be. The network doesn't seem willing to give up on the franchise yet, though. Evans' return might be an attempt at bolstering the show's plummeting ratings. Still, it doesn't look like they are putting all their eggs in Evans' basket. She isn't the only controversial cast member rumored to be returning to the series.\n\nAccording to an insider who spoke with Teen Mom Fanz, Ryan Edwards and his new girlfriend, Amanda Conner, are filming. Edwards and his then-wife, Mackenzie Standifer, were fired in 2021. Since then, Edwards has had a series of serious arrests and spent time in rehab. He was also accused of some pretty menacing behavior toward his estranged wife. Edwards has not yet commented on his rumored return.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_francese@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Andrea Francese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jenelle-Evans-interview.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The former reality TV alum was approached by authorities while residing on the former couple's boat, according to photos and a video obtained by The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"David was served with Jenelle's complaint for separation, as well as a complaint for a domestic violence protective order,\" a source close to the situation told the publication, adding that the mom of three previously requested an emergency protective order.\n\nThe 16 & Pregnant star accused her estranged husband of forcing her to go through North Carolina's lengthy separation process instead of \"allowing\" her to file for divorce.\n\n\"I would've skipped straight to a divorce, but I couldn't. In the state of North Carolina, you have to be legally separated for a year,\" Jenelle explained in a TikTok Q&A with fans on March 6, 2024. When a North Carolina-based follower told the Teen Mom alum that she and her former spouse were able to divorce after only a month of separation, Jenelle responded, \"He won't allow that.\"\n\nJenelle and David welcomed one child during their marriage, a daughter named Ensley Jolie Eason, in January 2017. Jenelle is also a mom to her sons Jace and Kaiser from previous relationships, while David shares a daughter named Maryssa with his ex-wife and a son named Kaden with another ex.\n\nDavid was fired from Teen Mom 2 in 2018 after making homophobic and transphobic remarks on Twitter. At the time, Jenelle continued to film the show at various locations where David was not present, like inside cars or while in town.\n\nThe MTV personality was later let go from the network in April 2019 when David shot and killed her French bulldog after claiming it nipped at their daughter.\n\n\"MTV ended its relationship with David Eason over a year ago in February 2018 and has not filmed any new episodes of Teen Mom 2 with him since,\" the network said in a statement in May 2019. \"Additionally, we have stopped filming with Jenelle Eason as of April 6, 2019, and have no plans to cover her story in the upcoming season.\"\n\nJenelle is set to appear on the upcoming season of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter.

I filed for separation,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\nJenelle and David have separated many times in the past, but if the two-way allegations of abuse and infidelity are any indication, this time, the marriage is over for good.\n\nWe'll have further updates on this developing story as new information becomes available.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_johnson@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Tyler Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Portwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amber Portwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catelynn_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catelynn Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maci_Bookout", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maci Bookout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1095004178-4-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

This fantastic opportunity seemingly stemmed from the end of her relationship with her now-estranged husband, David Eason.\n\nThe \"16 and Pregnant\" alum, who is currently locked in a custody battle with her ex, made a splashy appearance in the preview of the upcoming \"Teen Mom: The Next Chapter\" show.\n\nShe is seen walking in a tan pantsuit before teasing viewers about her return by saying: \"I think it'll be good to have a fresh start.\" As stated, Evans is embracing a new chapter in her life following the end of her longtime relationship with Eason.\n\nMTV presumably celebrated Evans' newfound single status by giving her a second chance on \"Teen Moms\" since her ex reportedly influenced their decision to fire her in 2019.\n\nAt the time, Evans' ties to the network were severed after her now-estranged husband shot and killed their family dog. A year before the tragic event, MTV kicked Eason off their program after he posted a barrage of homophobic and transphobic tweets, per PageSix.\n\nA week before her comeback was confirmed, Evans sparked speculations of a \"Teen Mom\" reprisal after reuniting with a former castmate. She was spotted hanging out with Briana Dejesus' home in Florida.\n\nThe pair were photographed walking together while wearing casual ensembles amid production for the upcoming show. However, fans can kiss their dreams of seeing Evans as a full-time castmate.\n\nAccording to a press release from MTV, Evans isn't reprising her former spot in the next \"Teen Mom\" installment. Instead, she will make a \"special appearance\" to address the latest chapter of her life.\n\nHer time on the show will reportedly focus on unpacking the early stages of her separation from Eason as she makes \"life-changing\" decisions.\n\nTwo months before her \"Teen Mom\" comeback, Evans revealed in a TikTok post that she had filed for legal separation from Eason. The video, set to Lady Gaga's hit \"Applause,\" saw her lip-syncing to the track before bowing to the camera.\n\nThe overlay text read: \"Can I get some appreciation? I filed for separation.\" She doubled down on her newfound single status in the post's caption, writing: \"New Chapter Unlocked.\"\n\nIt is unclear if her message teased her appearance in the upcoming \"Teen Mom: The Next Chapter\" or if it referenced the end of her marriage to Eason.\n\nAs for why she filed for legal separation instead of a full-blown divorce, Evans explained her choice in a follow-up post. The 32-year-old noted that couples in North Carolina must be legally separated for a year and have two separate addresses before proceedings can begin.\n\nFollowing her legal separation from Eason, The Blast reported that Evans had moved to obtain full custody of the duo's daughter, Ensley. In her court documents, the reality TV star stressed that her estranged husband wasn't fit to be a dad.\n\nShe argued that he has repeatedly failed to prove himself as a good dad, while she has been solely responsible for catering to their daughter's needs. The documents stressed that Evans \"is a fit and proper person to have primary physical custody of the minor child,\" adding:\n\n\"At nearly all times, plaintiff has been responsible for the minor child's daily needs and has been the only parent who researched, evaluated, selected and followed through with the minor child's doctor's treatment providers, extracurricular and enrichment activities.\"\n\nAside from bashing her estranged husband as a bad father, Evans implied that he shouldn't be around their daughter without proof of his mental stability.\n\n\"It is in the best interest of the minor child that plaintiff be granted primary physical custody of the minor child,\" the documents reiterated, adding:\n\n\"and that defendant's visitation and or custodial time be predicated on a mental health assessment to ensure his fitness and ability to care for the minor child.\"\n\nAdditionally, Evans noted that she was pushing for mental health checks because of her Eason dark past. She claimed he had a \"history of erratic behavior\" and \"substance abuse,\" which hindered his ability to parent their daughter.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afouda_bamidele@theblast.com", "name": "Afouda Bamidele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_and_Pregnant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "16 and Pregnant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_separation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal separation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contact (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1302x602/2024/05/08143642/Jenelle-Evans-1.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

She made her franchise comeback in September 2022, though is set to return once again in May 2024.\n\nWhat Happened During Jenelle Evans' 'Teen Mom' Appearance?\n\nDuring the September 13, 2022, episode of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, Jenelle joined stars Briana DeJesus and Jade Cline for a party that celebrated the Florida native's victory in court against Kailyn Lowry.\n\nJenelle shared an update about the status of her relationship with her husband, David Eason, during the celebration. \"Life's been good, well not really,\" she said. \"Me and David, we haven't been getting along lately. I mean, it's just on and off and it's just the fact that -- I don't care if I share this with any of you either -- it's just the fact that he doesn't -- which everyone knows -- he doesn't have a job and I'm sitting here providing for everyone for years and it's still the same way.\"\n\n\"I'm so fed up and I've been giving him the cold shoulder, not talking to him,\" she continued. \"We text to talk now and he'll be on the other side of my land in his shop.

However, after one fan commented telling the North Carolina native to \"just do one more season,\" Jenelle responded saying, \"They don't want me.\"\n\n\"They did invite me back, but I said 'no.'

Jenelle Evans is returning to the Teen Mom franchise after she was fired from the show in 2019. The 32-year-old mother of three announced her return on Wednesday, revealing that she will be appearing in the spin-off series, Teen Mom: Next Chapter.\n\nThe former MTV star shared a pic of herself sitting in what appears to be the pilot's seat of a plane and grinning as she snaps a photo of the cameraman on her phone.\n\nJenelle also appears in the special's newly released trailer, doing a slow-motion walk with her shades as her voiceover says, \"I think it'll be good to have a fresh start.\"\n\nIn the press release for the upcoming show, MTV says that Jenelle will be returning for a \"special appearance amid her divorce and life-changing moves.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Jenelle will appear in all 15 episodes of the series or will just make a cameo.\n\nOther stars featured on this season include Catelynn Lowell Baltierra, Jade Cline, Cheyenne Davis, Briana DeJesus, Ashley Jones, Maci Bookout, Leah Messer and Amber Portwood.\n\nJenelle previously returned to the show in 2022 for a brief cameo, attending an event for Briana.\n\nJenelle is currently separated from her husband, David Eason, after the two tied the knot in 2017. In the state of North Carolina, where she currently resides, couples have to be separated for a year before they can divorce.\n\nShe announced her decision to separate in March in a TikTok video. It's been a time of transition for Jenelle, who is mom to 14-year-old son Jace Evans with ex Andrew Lewis, 9-year-old son Kaiser Griffin with ex Nathan Griffin, and 7-year-old daughter Ensley Eason with David.\n\nAfter years of ups and downs with her mom, Jenelle finally got custody of Jace in early 2023 -- but it wasn't smooth sailing from there.\n\nJace ran away from home multiple times in August and September. At the time, Jenelle claimed the incidents were due to Jace's frustrations after she and David took away his phone.\n\nLate last month, Jenelle said on TikTok that Child Protective Services had dropped the case against her and David and that Jace had been returned to her home.\n\n\"All allegations against me and my husband have been officially dropped,\" Jenelle said on TikTok. \"CPS took a voluntary dismissal.\"\n\n\"Now that this case has been dropped, I'm focusing on Jace's mental health and I want to focus solely on his mental health right now,\" she continued. \"Right now I'm not going to give any details on what happened pertaining to the case but it will be shared eventually and soon. Just not right now. It's not the best time.\"\n\nThis also isn't the first time Jenelle has announced her plans to split from David. In 2019, the former reality star announced that she and her children had \"moved away from David,\" adding, \"Nobody gets into a marriage expecting it to end but I know that's what is best for me, and for my kids. Today I've filed papers to start that process.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slow motion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Portwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amber Portwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catelynn_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catelynn Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maci_Bookout", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maci Bookout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-05/Screenshot%202024-05-09%20at%2011.56.39%20AM.png?h=f270e46b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The Teen Mom: The Next Chapter star has separated from her husband, David Eason, regained her job with MTV, and reconnected with old friends. She is looking to shake things up even more. According to rumors, Jenelle Evans is planning a move to a new state, and a recent Teen Mom: The Next Chapter trailer suggests the move could play out on-screen.\n\nJenelle Evans is making major moves in her life. Not only has she gained employment with MTV again, but she's also looking to hop states. According to an insider who spoke with TMZ, Evans is currently in the market for a new house in Florida. The insider claims Evans spent some time in Florida last week touring properties and weighing her options. She is said to be searching for a home in the Central Florida area. The mother of three currently resides in North Carolina. She was in Florida last week with co-star Briana DeJesus. DeJesus' home base is in Central Florida.\n\nMTV's recent Teen Mom: The Next Chapter trailer bolstered the report's credibility. In a trailer dropped to the Teen Mom social media pages, Evans is seen in the final seconds walking down a street. In her voiceover, Evans says that a \"fresh start\" would be good.\n\nSurely, there is no better way to get a fresh start than to move to a different state. If the trailer and recent reports are any indication, Evans' storyline in the upcoming season of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter will focus on a potential move from North Carolina to Florida. MTV will likely cover her impending divorce, as well.\n\nWhile Evans is rumored to be searching for a home close to Briana DeJesus' Kissimmee-area home, some followers wonder if she can really pick up and move so quickly. Evans and Eason have not started divorce proceedings, but presumably, he'll want at least some custody of the child he shares with Evans once the process is underway. If Eason wants to fight it, he could prevent Evans from taking their shared child, Ensley Eason, out of state. Eason is likely the only father who would try to prevent Evans from moving states.\n\nEvans shares her other two children with different former partners. She shares her eldest child, Jace Evans, with her high school boyfriend, Andrew Lewis. Lewis has shown up in recent months to connect with Jace. Still, it is the first time he's had any relationship with him. He does not have a custody arrangement in place. Nathan Griffith is the father of Evans' second child, Kaiser Griffith. Griffith was initially involved with his son, but he has not had contact with him in some time. Griffith has had a host of legal and health troubles to contend with in recent months. It is unlikely he would fight a move.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_francese@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Andrea Francese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jenelle-Evans-2.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The trailer shows her walking down the street wearing a beige pantsuit and looking off into the distance, saying in a voiceover that she thinks \"it will be good to have a fresh start.\"\n\nAfter being fired from the popular MTV reality series five years ago, Evans is returning to Teen Mom: The Next Chapter. A press release from MTV noted that she will not be returning as a full-time cast member, per Page Six, but rather will be making \"special appearances\" as she continues to make \"life-changing\" moves. One of those life-changing moves being her recent decision to separate from Eason, who was not exactly a popular addition to the Teen Mom franchise.\n\nRumors that the 32-year-old mom of three was considering a return to Teen Mom: The Next Chapter began circulating after she was seen hanging out in Florida with veteran cast member Briana Dejesus. Her return comes two months after she announced the end of her tumultuous marriage to David Eason, who was investigated by Child Protective Services for abuse after killing the family dog back in 2019. Evans' oldest child Jace had also called the police on Eason from his grandmother's house, claiming to be hiding from his stepfather after running away from home multiple times.\n\nEvans announced her separation from Eason on TikTok in March, asking her followers for some \"appreciation\" and danced in a video to Lady Gaga's \"Applause,\" before lip-syncing to Gypsy Rose Blanchard saying, \"You can't bring me down, I'm on a high right now.\"\n\nWhile we don't know what Evans' appearance on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter will look like, Season 2 of the series premieres on MTV on May 30 so we don't have too long to wait.

In an April 20, 2024 TikTok video, the 32-year-old stated that she was \"busy\" with an undisclosed project.\n\n\"Doing a lot of work right now. But I can't tell you guys what it is. I will soon. But I'm busy. Doing some stuff,\" said Evans with a smile.\n\nShe also gave an update on her and her three children, Ensley, Jace, and Kaiser.\n\n\"I'm doing good mentally. Everything is going pretty great here. The kids have been good. I've been good,\" said the mother of three.\n\nFans flocked to the post's comments section to share they appreciated Evans' video.\n\n\"You legit seem more happy happy for you,\" wrote a commenter.\n\n\"Jenelle! you are doing so good.

According to The U.S. Sun, court documents showed that Evans claimed her estranged husband \"has exhibited concerning and at times disturbing behavior towards the plaintiff.\" She also alleged that \"in May of 2019, Defendant shot and killed the family's pet French Bulldog Nugget in front of the minor child [Ensley].\" She also claimed he exhibited abusive behavior toward herself and her eldest son, Jace, fathered by her ex-boyfriend, Andrew Lewis. In addition, Evans stated she was concerned about Easton's consumption of alcohol.\n\n\"Defendant would regularly drink and drive and spend excess money on alcohol - money which he does not earn and which could otherwise go toward the financial well-being of the minor children,\" read a portion of the statement.\n\nIn a March 6, 2024 TikTok upload, Evans explained why she has not yet divorced Easton. She explained that laws in her home state of North Carolina require a year-long separation before a married couple can divorce.\n\n\"I would have skipped straight to divorce. But I couldn't. Because in the state of North Carolina, you have to be legally separated for year,\" said the \"Teen Mom\" star. \"You have to prove that you have two separate addresses.\"\n\n\"Teen Mom: The Next Chapter\" season 2 begins airing on May 30.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_moore@heavy.com", "name": "Nicole Moore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masked_Singer_(American_season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Masked Singer (American season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Easton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Easton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Bulldog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Bulldog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_separation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal separation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Teen-Mom-4.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 2825, "textEnd": 2831}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 516, "textEnd": 524}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Sources tell us Jenelle is looking to move forward, and put her life with David -- which has deep roots in Carolina -- firmly in her past.\n\nJenelle is serious about relocating ... our sources tell us her move could happen as soon as the next 90 days, but she's also considering just waiting until her divorce is finalized in 8 months.\n\nOne thing is clear ... FL is on Jenelle's mind as her next home base, and she's planning all she can, at this point, to make it happen.\n\nIt doesn't sound like Jenelle has looped David in on her plan though ... as we're told they're not on speaking terms and haven't been for about 3 months.\n\nBTW ... Jenelle's planning to relocate with her 3 kids, including Jace, who she just regained full custody of last year. Her mom Barbara -- who raised Jace most of his childhood -- does have court-ordered visitation but does not have a say on where Jenelle lives with him.", "source": {"uri": "tmz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TMZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/53/16by9/2024/05/08/5303d4dd2f8842eb8a2a5e262339a75a_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

If you remember, TMZ was the first to report that the 'Teen Mom' star filed court documents in North Carolina stating that the couple will be separating.\n\nRELATED: Prayers: Jenelle Evans' Son In The Hospital Under CPS Care After Running Away Again\n\nThe Sun also reported that in the filing Evans made a lot of allegations about David such as him allegedly having erratic behavior, substance abuse and refusal to work. In the filing it also points out how David is currently wrapped up in criminal charges for allegedly abusing their son, Jace.\n\nAs we previously reported, Jace ran away from home multiple times last summer and Jenelle and David were suspected of child neglect but once Jace spoke to authorities when he ran away from home the third time Jace told police officers that David assaulted him. TMZ spoke with sources who were familiar with the incident and were told that Jace had visible markings on his arms and neck which led police officers to arrest David. According to the report, David facing two charges, misdemeanor child abuse and felony assault by strangulation.\n\nRELATED: Jenelle Evans' Husband, David Eason Charged With Child Abuse In Case Involving Her 14-Year-Old Son\n\nEvans first appeared on MTV's 16 and Pregnant, where she shared her story of becoming pregnant at a young age.

Her struggles with motherhood, relationships, and addiction were chronicled on Teen Mom 2, where viewers watched as she navigated the challenges of being a young parent.\n\nThroughout her time on the show, Evans has faced criticism and controversy for her choices and behavior. She has been involved in numerous legal issues, including arrests for drug possession, assault, and domestic violence. Her tumultuous relationships with partners, including ex-boyfriend Kieffer Delp and ex-husband Courtland Rogers, have been a focal point of the show.\n\nvans' journey as a teen mom has been a rollercoaster of emotions, with viewers watching as she navigates the ups and downs of parenthood and relationships.

He can't wait to take the stand, he hates David,\" the insider said.\n\nConversations between the District Attorney's office and Jace have transpired, and they will be working with the teen to make

marks on his arm and neck.\n\nChild Protective Services took custody of the teen in the immediate aftermath of the incident.\n\nIn February, in a shocking turn of events, CPS dismissed Jace's case and Jenelle resumed custody of the teen which left the MTV star in a predicament.\n\nHer husband David has a no-contact order against him for Jace, and the teen was expected to return to Jenelle's home.\n\nDavid moved out and began living on the couple's boat which is docked nearby.\n\nWithin a couple of weeks of CPS' decision to dismiss the case and with David living on the boat, Jenelle filed

The new season is set to premiere on Thursday, May 30th at 8PM ET/PT with Mackenzie McKee joining the cast and Jenelle Evans making a special appearance. Catelynn Baltierra, Jade Cline, Cheyenne Davis, Briana DeJesus, Ashley Jones, Maci McKinney, Leah Messer, and Amber Portwood are back returning.\n\nThe new season will feature 15, hour-long episodes. McKee joins the cast with her boyfriend after a lengthy divorce. Evans makes a special appearance amid her divorce and life-changing moves as she's recently relocated to Florida. Evans previously returned to the show in 2022 for a brief cameo, attending an event for DeJesus.\n\nEvans' return comes after she was fired in April 2019 after her then-husband, David Eason, shot and killed their family dog. According to Eason's account, the dog tried to bite the couple's toddler daughter Ensley in the face, forcing him to put it down. Ensley was two years old at the time of the incident.\n\nEvans and Eason have since separated after six years of marriage and are heading toward divorce. Their marriage was marred with allegations of abuse, with the final straw seemingly being Eason getting physical with Evans' teenage son, Jace, which promoted an investigation from Child Protective Services after Jace ran away from home several times.\n\nEvans claimed in a recent TikTok video that Child Protective Services dropped the case against her and Eason, and that Jace had been returned to her home after he was briefly taken from her custody. She previously went through a custody battle with her mother, Barbra, who gained legal guardianship of Jace when he was a toddler. Evans earned custody back last year. She's seemingly had trouble disciplining the teen.\n\n\"Now that this case has been dropped, I'm focusing on Jace's mental health and I want to focus solely on his mental health right now,\" she said in the TikTok video, as reported by Entertainment Tonight. \"Right now I'm not going to give any details on what happened pertaining to the case but it will be shared eventually and soon. Just not right now. It's not the best time.\"\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Mom:_The_Next_Chapter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Mom: The Next Chapter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_McKee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mackenzie McKee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Portwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amber Portwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catelynn_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catelynn Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maci_Bookout", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maci Bookout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2022/12/10/0898f128-1848-49cc-b6bd-0d130e04b89b/jenelle-evans.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551074", "eventUri": "eng-9551074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 108, "textEnd": 116}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 733, "textEnd": 743}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The rapper, a native of the Los Angeles city and an unannounced \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the ceremony, praised both Compton and the students in his remarks. \u201cI wanted to come out here just to tell y\u2019all how much I appreciate y\u2019all. I\u2019m proud of the city of Compton, I\u2019m proud of Compton College, most importantly I\u2019m proud of the graduates out here,\u201d Lamar told the graduates. \u201cI know what it takes. You had a lot of hardship, not only in your house, in your communities, but most importantly, in yourself, and that\u2019s the toughest thing to overcome. We still growing day by day, brick by brick, making sure we develop, not only in physical form but in the spiritual as well.\u201d Lamar\u2019 speech begins at the 43-minute mark of the video below: \u201cSeeing you out here, it is not only a representation of the world, but it\u2019s a representation of me. When I walk out in these cities in these countries, I can be proud and say, \u2018This is where I\u2019m from.\u2019 I still believe in Compton, Compton always been a future for me. I think we bring some of the most incredible individuals: Creatives, intellectuals, talent. We had since day one, that\u2019s why I always scream this city. I traveled the world, there\u2019s no place like this one right here. No place,\u201d Lamar continued. \u201cAnd I still believe in everything we\u2019re doing, brick by brick, it\u2019s time that we change the narratives. Some people tell us this generation don\u2019t have what it takes. Gen Z. We talk about it all day. They try to pull us down and say we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. They wrong though. Because not only you all have what it takes, you have something bigger: You have the heart and the courage to be independent thinkers. There\u2019s nothing more valuable than that.\u201d The rapper then talked about how the graduates could apply what they\u2019ve learned as independent thinkers and spread their message to the community, and especially the youth. \u201cThis degree you have right here is just as big as any degree. I don\u2019t care what school, what institution. Compton College, this Compton degree is just as big,\u201d Lamar added. \u201cNow it\u2019s all about taking these resources and taking what you learned and applying. It\u2019s as simple as that. You\u2019ll have hardships, you gonna have tribulations as you had coming up here, but guess what? You have someone special in your corner and all around you and that\u2019s God, period. Every step of the way.\u201d Lamar will return to the Los Angeles stage in his usual capacity on June 19 as the rapper hosts The Pop Out \u2014 Ken and Friends concert at the Kia Forum on Juneteenth, a special one-off gig that will be streamed live on Prime Video.", "summary": "\"Seeing you out here, it is not only a representation of the world, but it\u2019s a representation of me.

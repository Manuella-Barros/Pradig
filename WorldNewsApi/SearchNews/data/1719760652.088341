The A Place In The Sun presenter appeared on Loose Women to talk about her late co-star. Jonnie died earlier this year at the age of 50 after a brave battle with cancer. The dad-of-three, who also presented BBC's Escape To The Country, announced in November 2022 that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer in 2020 and that it had spread to his brain. In early February this year, a family spokesperson shared that Jonnie had \"fought bravely against cancer with unwavering strength and courage\" before he passed away at 50. Jasmine and Jonnie presented their first A Place in the Sun episode on Channel 4 in February 2004 and became close. She made an appearance on the ITV daytime show to discuss Jonnie for the first time on air since his tragic death. Jasmine's voice broke as she spoke about her close friend and recalled how they met. A montage of photos was shown as Jasmine said: \"Looking at these old photos chokes me up actually. \"It was a big break away for both of us from what we had been doing previously, going to working in television. We didn't always film together as we were often in different countries but we used to get together at A Place In The Sun events all the time and we became good friends. Jonnie came to my wedding. \"I met my husband on the show and when Jonnie met Jess, his lovely wife, I just remember thinking 'wow she is the one for him'. Then they had their lovely boys. And yes, it really is a hard time...\" Host Kaye Adams noticed Jasmine's voice breaking as she cut in: \"This is fresh and I totally appreciate this Jasmine. I mean it has only been a matter of months since Jonnie passed away and the loss of a friends. All losses are difficult, but the loss of a friend going back 20 years is a particular loss. I don't know, one reflects on their life.\" Jasmine agreed as she said: \"Absolutely and I think you never know what's around the corner and I think Jonnie's situation, we can all take something from it.\" She then broke down in tears as Denise grabbed her a tissue. Jasmine added: \"Sorry,\" as Kaye urged: \"Take a minute, take a minute.\" She went on to talk about her close friend Jonnie and finished by saying: \"The outpouring of love for him has been amazing, so I want to thank all the people for their messages.\" Viewers at home reacted to the moment as one said: \"She isn't ready to talk about this situation.\" Another added: \"Bless Jasmine.. this is too fresh and painful for her. She's a lovely lady & clearly had a very strong friendship with Jonnie.\" In a gushing tribute a month after Jonnie's death, Jasmine said: \"It's been a month since we lost a very special person; someone I was lucky enough to call a friend. Time has this weird habit of keeping on going when it feels like it should stop. Today I'm at A Place in the Sun Live and it is hard as Jonnie is on my mind a lot. Over the years, we were always filming in different locations and so we most frequently got to spend time together at the A Place in the Sun Live events. This photo was taken here last year in Manchester. It feels strange and sad to be here without him. He was such an inspiration to so many people and he is missed so much. Thank you to all the people who have given messages of support and as always my thoughts and love are with Jonnie's family.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads.", "summary": "A Place In The Sun presenter Jasmine Harman was left in floods of tears as she opened up on the loss of her close friend and co-star Jonnie Irwin while on Loose Women", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/jasmine-harman-breaks-down-tears-32916604", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32916700.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LW.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:33:08", "author": "Mia O'Hare", "authors": ["Mia O'Hare"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.196}

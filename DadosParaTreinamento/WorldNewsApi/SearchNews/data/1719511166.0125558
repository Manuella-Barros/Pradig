The reality TV star, 30, smiled for the camera while standing against the hospitality balcony at York races. Dressed to impress in a head turning outfit, Izzy looked like a star. And while fans praised her for looking amazing, some noticed that she had re-worn a dress she wore to her sister Ellie's baby shower. Sharing the snap on Instagram, Izzy captioned the post saying: \"Trying to pick a winner.\" Addressing comments about her re-wearing the same dress, she explained: \"PS I was invited last minute so you may have seen this dress before, rocking a rewear.\" But fans were clearly more in awe of her following her candid admission. One person said: \"Absolutely nothing wrong with a re-wear! Nice dresses deserve to be seen. Plus, cost per wear in my book.\" Another said: \"Repeat offender and I am here for it, rewear is awesome babe!\" And a third person commented: \"Looking fab! And rewears should be the norm.\" Izzy and her lookalike sister Ellie became household names since they joined the Channel 4 TV critic show in 2015. The mum of two, who has been in a long-term relationship with her partner Grant, has also embarked on a successful weight-loss journey. The reality TV star started her body positive path following the birth of her daughter Bessie, aged four. And her new svelte look has gone down well with fans. Back in 2020, just months after she welcomed Bessie into the world, she took to Instagram to show off her weight-loss journey. But one thing she wasn't pleased about was Grant's inability to take a decent picture. She captioned her post at the time saying: \"If anyone knows any crash courses in photography I can send Grant on please let me know.\" She added the hashtags #wheresmyfeet #bestofabadbunch #datenight. At the time of Bessie's birth, she shared an adorable picture of her second child and captioned the post: \"So pleased to announce the safe arrival of our darling baby girl Bessie Rose. Born on 3rd February 2020 1:44pm, weighing 7lb 3oz.We are all totally smitten by her, feeling so blessed and happy. thanks everyone for all your well wishes.\" The following year her shrinking frame was even more apparent when she posted a picture of herself in a black leather dress. She completed her look with a cute Louis Vuitton bag as she enjoyed a dinner date with her older sister Ellie. She captioned the post saying: \"\"Sister sister.\" And fans could not get enough of her new look. One said: \"Gorgeous girls! You're never bloody in at the minute!\". A second said: \"Beautiful picture of you both.\" And a third penned: \"Looking good ladies.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads", "summary": "Gogglebox's Izzy Warner looked elegant as she enjoyed an opulent day at the races and her fans loved her glam look which was completely different to her usual casual appearance", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/gogglebox-star-looks-completely-different-32896658", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896655.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gogglebox.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:35:40", "author": "Lucretia Munro,Lucretia-munro", "authors": ["Lucretia Munro", "Lucretia-munro"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.424}

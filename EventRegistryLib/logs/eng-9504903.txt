But in either case, we'll go to 54 with this list and divide it into two parts.\n\nIf you've been in Browns hibernation and need to catch up on the draft and offseason, here we go with part one.\n\n1. This is the end of the Deshaun Watson trade. The Browns sent six picks to Houston in March 2022; the first-rounder (the Texans have since traded it to Minnesota) and fourth-rounder this year mark the end of the compensation. As of now, the Browns have picks in each of the first four rounds in 2025. In the last two years, Berry has also traded out of the second round and started their draft in the third.\n\n2. If only this was the end of the Watson uncertainty.\n\n3. The Browns have uncertainty at offensive tackle, a premium position and one that's always been treated as an important one by the Berry-led front office. In a glass-half-full view of things, the Browns have three starting-caliber tackles and will have them all healthy and available by the start of the season. Jedrick Wills Jr. and Dawand Jones are working back from knee surgeries that ended their 2023 seasons early, and Jack Conklin is working back from a Week 1 ACL tear. All three will be on the team this year; Conklin has $5 million in guarantees on the extension he signed in 2022, and Wills is under contract only for this season on the fifth-year option of his rookie deal. Jones looked like a keeper -- and maybe a future star -- when he got comfortable in his rookie season before getting injured.\n\n4. We may or may not get some clarity on the tackle spot this weekend. It probably makes sense to let Wills play left tackle in a contract year and see if he can find some consistency and potentially earn an extension. Conklin needed some extra time at the start of 2022, and though his injury history is concerning, he's been a good player -- and Jones is capable of playing well at right tackle. James Hudson is under contract for one more season as an emergency option, and the team has added veterans Germain Ifedi and Hakeem Adeniji in recent weeks. Will the Browns draft a young offensive tackle this weekend with hopes of developing him throughout the rookie season and potentially playing him at left tackle in 2025? Or will they mostly stick with who and what they have, leaving the first round in 2025 as a potential route to finding someone to fill the position?\n\n5. The Browns have spent big, acquired (and retained) proven veteran players and had a roster talented enough to make the playoffs last season despite having five different quarterbacks start regular-season games. Though receiver and both lines stand out as obvious areas where further talent is needed, Berry always prefers to draft for the future. Kevin Stefanski sometimes reminds himself \"players over plays\" when building an offensive game plan. In this draft, Berry can go players over specific positions or certain needs. Cleveland has just two picks in the top 150 in this draft, but it still can get better this weekend.\n\n6. Berry says a general manager's job is to have one foot in the present and one tilted toward the future. This current team is trying to win now. Still, the Browns need to put young talent in the pipeline and supplement multiple spots on the roster. Last year reinforced the idea that the unexpected is coming at some point, and the Browns found themselves scrambling not just at quarterback but at offensive tackle and safety, too.\n\n7. So, every pick matters. Nobody bats 1.000 -- or even .600 -- but the misses hurt in the near future and distant future. And that causes you to spend even more money to fix the issues.\n\n8. Why do I think the Browns are almost certain to add a defensive tackle and wide receiver in this group despite making other offseason additions? Because their top three defensive tackles are in their 30s, and because Amari Cooper is headed for his age-30 season and the final year of his current contract. The Browns acquired and extended Jerry Jeudy in March, but until I see differently, I'll continue to view the Browns as having Cooper as their clear-cut top receiver and then a bunch of question marks behind him.\n\n9. Maybe Jeudy just needed a change of scenery. Maybe Cedric Tillman will take a second-year leap. I see both as possible. But for as good as Cooper has been, there would be risk in the Browns extending him. If he can play a full season and stay healthy, it has to be considered a bonus. The Cooper trade is one of the best moves Berry has made. We saw last season that Cooper is still elite when at his best. But if the Browns don't extend him before the 2024 season, it will be at least somewhat understandable -- and they'll need to prepare for the future.\n\n10. My final mock draft pick for the Browns has been Oregon wide receiver Troy Franklin. A couple of months ago, I would have never believed Franklin would be available at No. 54. Maybe he won't be, but he's now being generally graded as more like the No. 10-13 wide receiver in this draft than No. 5 or 6. Dane Brugler, The Athletic's draft guru, gave Franklin a second/third-round grade but had him going before No. 54 in his final mock.\n\n11. Why did I land on Franklin? Well, I'm guessing. Let's be honest about the external mock draft business. So are the rest of you online wiseguys. But my last and best guess went to Franklin because two scouts I trust told me there's a chance he's still there at No. 54, but also because I view Franklin as the kind of young (21), high-ceiling prospect the Browns have targeted early in drafts. He needs to add muscle and polish to his game, but I think he can eventually be an impactful player. And the Browns right now can bring him along at least semi-slowly, if necessary.\n\n12. It's a long wait for the Browns once the draft begins, but they're used to it. There's simply no way they're going to trade back into the first round, they just don't have the ammo. It would also be a surprise if any kind of trade-up was in play ahead of their first selection. They've tackled this process knowing they wouldn't get to (or need to) target just one player, and without a fourth-round pick they'd find it difficult to move up without giving up future assets.\n\n13. Based on current pick ownership, 19 teams will have picked at least twice by the time the Browns go on the clock at No. 54. All three of Cleveland's AFC North rivals have five picks in the top 130, while the Browns are slated to start with picks 54 (second round), 85 (third) and 156 (fifth).\n\n14. Do the Browns want a fourth-rounder? Berry has made multiple picks in the fourth round in his last three drafts. Based on last year's No. 55 and 56 picks getting traded during the draft, the ballpark price for the Browns to go down four to six spots in a second-round trade would be a fifth-rounder, and the price to go down eight to 12 spots would be a fourth-rounder.\n\n15. In 2022, the Browns traded out of pick 44. They got back from Houston pick Nos. 68, 108 and 124 and started their draft with cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. That trade gave the Browns three fourth-round picks; they used two of them and traded another, getting back a fifth-rounder and 2023 fourth.\n\n16. In 2021, pick 85 got traded for pick 92 and 135. Last year, pick 87 got traded for 102, 164 and 222.\n\n17. Last year, Berry traded the Browns' second-round pick in late March as part of the deal to acquire wide receiver Elijah Moore. Berry only made one deal during the draft, a seventh-round trade with the Baltimore Ravens that brought back a seventh-rounder this year.\n\n18. I'd be stunned if the Browns traded cornerback Greg Newsome II. Last spring there was mild online hysteria about whether Newsome had actually requested a trade, and recently he was asked directly about trade rumors. I don't know that there was any substance to those supposed rumors or just a nod to the small level of uncertainty surrounding Newsome. In either case, I'd expect Newsome to still be with the Browns by the end of the weekend -- and almost certainly by the end of the 2024 season.\n\n19. Next week, the Browns face a deadline on whether to pick up Newsome's fifth-year option for 2025 at a fully guaranteed salary of more than $13 million. Berry has refused to discuss the Browns' intentions there, but it seems a near-certainty that they will pick it up. As Cleveland did with Wills earlier this offseason, that cap number on the option year can be reduced with an up-front cash payment, if necessary. And the option still means the Browns keep Newsome and can do a longer-term deal with him at any time. The option deadline is the next important (and expensive) business matter on the team's list, but it does not force any decisions or would force the Browns to part with a player who's still young, talented and plays a premium position. With Emerson a year away from being extension-eligible, perhaps the team's cornerback budget eventually becomes an issue. But right now, the Browns feel fine with what they believe is the league's best cornerback trio -- even after Newsome and Emerson struggled in the playoff loss in Houston.\n\n20. Even if Newsome isn't firmly in Cleveland's longer-term plans, his value to the current team probably greatly outweighs anything the Browns could get back in a trade. If some team called and offered an early second-rounder, the Browns would consider trading Newsome. But that call isn't coming, and the Browns don't get better by trading a young and at least semi-proven player for a midround pick. They're collecting cornerbacks, not looking to give them away. Right now, Newsome is their starter in the slot, a position that seems to become more important every season.\n\n21. It's hard to imagine the Browns drafting a player who makes an established, front-of-the-depth chart veteran immediately expendable. (Emphasis on immediately, as in this weekend or the coming weeks.) But the same probably isn't true with other teams, especially those with multiple early picks and/or pressing salary-cap issues. So while it would be a surprise to see the Browns trade a starting player, it wouldn't be surprising to see them make a trade for a veteran player by the end of this weekend. Is that why Berry added that extra seventh-round pick earlier in April in a trade with the Tennessee Titans? Stay tuned.\n\n22. When will the Browns be able to focus on which player they'll be picking, or what their best trade option might be? \"It probably starts Thursday night (after the first round) where you kind of re-strategize a little bit based on what's happened,\" Berry said last week. \"But in reality, you probably get a more narrow focus maybe 10 -- (let's) call it 10 picks out, because that's when really players become, I guess, more in striking distance.\"\n\n23. Will the Browns make another trade to open their draft? \"I'm not sure as we sit here,\" Berry said, \"but we'll see if we can break the trend of making it three years in a row without a second-round pick.\"\n\n24. The last time the Browns picked in the first round, in 2021, I was right about the selection being Newsome. I did, in fact, victory lap it relentlessly. Since then, I've been reminded that mock drafting is a tough business.\n\n25. The last time the Browns made a second-round pick (also 2021), they did so after trading up to get linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, who's in line for an extension at some point this summer after posting a big 2023 season. The Browns gave picks 59 and 89 to Carolina to get pick 52, where they got Owusu-Koramoah, and pick 113.\n\n26. If Berry is willing (and looking) to trade down Friday night, who might be calling? The Washington Commanders have three picks in the top 40 and three more from 67 to 100. They might be willing to give two picks to move up. The San Francisco 49ers head to the draft owning Nos. 63, 94, 124, 132, 135 and 176, making them a potential trade partner based on Berry's history. As you're likely aware, the Browns and Texans have been known to make a trade. The Texans hold picks 59, 86, 123, 127, 188 and 189, so if they think they need to move up in the second round for a certain player, they have the midround ammo to do it.\n\n27. Per the NFL Players Association's Public Salary Cap Report, as of Wednesday morning the Browns had 74 players under contract and just over $14.8 million in available cap space. The offseason roster maximum is 90, so with Cleveland sitting on six picks and making six to eight additions of undrafted free agents following the draft, that still would leave space for the team to add veteran players at some point. If the Browns need more cap space at any point in the coming months, they have options and can exercise their right to restructure Watson's contract. Watson is slated to play at a cap number of $63.9 million in each of the next three seasons.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They currently own just five picks in the seven-round draft.\n\nAll rounds will be televised on ESPN/ABC and NFL Network and in Spanish on ESPN Deportes.\n\n* Head coach: Kevin Stefanski (fifth season with team)\n\n* Last year's record: 11-6, eliminated in AFC wild-card round\n\nThe Browns had a wild but successful 2023 season as they became the first team since 2015 to win a game with four different starting quarterbacks and make the playoffs along the ride. They entered March with few glaring roster needs and focused on keeping the core of last year's team together. The defense was fixed last offseason and thrived under the pressure-first scheme implemented by defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. The offense needs to be fixed now, as Deshaun Watson works his way back from major shoulder surgery, Nick Chubb works his way from two major knee surgeries and new receiver Jerry Jeudy aims to give the Browns speed they didn't have last season. The Browns rushed into an extension for Jeudy, continuing a line of big bets on the offensive side that have produced mixed results thus far.\n\nWill Watson finally deliver? Was the defensive nightmare in the playoffs just one bad day? The Browns think they have the manpower to keep up in the loaded AFC, but Watson has much to prove.\n\nDefensive line: Last year, this was the clear top offseason priority. But most of the group returns, and the Browns have gotten older across the defensive front. There's risk in that, but reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett headlines a group that will look to add some youth in the draft.\n\nWide receiver: Amari Cooper remains the clear-cut No. 1 wideout. But he'll be 30 during the final year of his current contract, and the Browns have question marks behind him. With Elijah Moore also entering the final year of his current deal, look for Cleveland to try to add a developmental-type prospect even after the addition of Jeudy.\n\nRound it out: Mostly, the Browns are drafting for depth and for the future. All 11 opening-day offensive starters are on track to be back, and the defense returns its top rushers, top four cornerbacks and top five safeties. In many ways, Pro Bowl tight end David Njoku is a turbo-charged wide receiver, so look for the Browns at some point to add another traditional tight end.\n\nFuture flexibility: The Browns don't consider linebacker a premium position, but they do consider offensive tackle one. With some uncertainty surrounding the futures of Jedrick Wills Jr. and Jack Conklin, the Browns could draft a developmental tackle. Though they'll likely draft a linebacker, too, their recent track record says they won't prioritize that position.\n\nBrowns big board: Taking a look at potential options on Days 2 and 3\n\nBrowns 7-round mock draft: Finding value despite no first-round pick\n\nExamining Browns' picks in Dane Brugler's 7-round mock draft\n\nBrowns and 'The Beast': NFL Draft guide takeaways on potential targets in Rounds 2 and 3\n\nBrowns seven-round mock draft: Defensive line, WR help on the way\n\nCleveland Browns big board: Defensive line help among biggest priorities\n\nBrowns at NFL combine: How will salary-cap changes affect the roster and draft plans?\n\nExploring Browns 2024 draft needs: Finding wide receiver help is a must\n\nApril 24: Beat writer mock draft 3.0\n\nZac Jackson has the Browns selecting a wideout when the team is first on the clock at No. 54.\n\nApril 17: Dane Brugler's seven-round mock draft\n\nBrugler has Cleveland getting help on both lines of scrimmage with its first two picks in the second and third rounds.\n\nApril 8: Nick Baumgardner's three-round NFL mock draft\n\nBaumgardner has the Browns adding receiver and O-line help with their first two selections.\n\nApril 4: Bruce Feldman's NFL mock draft\n\nFeldman has Cleveland selecting Georgia wideout Ladd McConkey with its first pick in the second round.\n\nMarch 25: Ben Standig's NFL mock draft\n\nStandig has the Browns selecting Iowa State cornerback T.J. Tampa with their first pick in Round 2.\n\nMarch 21: Beat writer mock draft 2.0\n\nJackson has Cleveland taking defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr. out of Ohio State with its first selection at No. 54.\n\nMarch 5: Dane Brugler's post-combine mock draft\n\nBrugler has the Browns adding to their receiving corps by selecting Florida wideout Ricky Pearsall.\n\nFeb. 22: Beat writer mock draft 1.0\n\nJackson has the Browns going with Western Kentucky wide receiver Malachi Corley with their first selection.\n\n2023: Cedric Tillman, WR, No. 74 -- He's a big target, and the team is optimistic he'll take a leap after a quiet rookie season. General manager Andrew Berry has made several good decisions in rebuilding the Browns, but the next wide receiver draft pick who becomes a hit will be the first.\n\n2022: Martin Emerson Jr., CB, No. 68 -- He's at least a keeper and appears to have some star qualities. Though he struggled in January's playoff loss, Emerson is fearless, savvy and allows the Browns to play man-to-man at a higher rate than the league average. He could be a year away from a big-money extension.\n\n2021: Greg Newsome II, CB, No. 26 -- Newsome had an up-and-down 2023, but he returned his first career interception for a touchdown in a November win at Baltimore and remains an important player. The Browns face a May decision on his 2025 option of more than $15 million, and his future is uncertain because he's currently the team's No. 3 cornerback. A big season lies ahead.\n\n2020: Jedrick Wills Jr., OT, No. 10 -- A college right tackle for the left-handed Tua Tagovailoa, Wills immediately transitioned to the left side with the Browns. He's been mostly solid when healthy, but his long-term future is uncertain. He's playing 2024 on a twice-reworked fifth-year option of his rookie deal, and he'll need a strong year to put himself in the team's long-term plans.\n\n2019: Greedy Williams, CB, No. 46 -- Williams struggled to stay healthy and never played much past his rookie season. The Browns' current regime drafted over him twice, and Williams left after the 2022 season to be a backup with the Philadelphia Eagles.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news",

Fortunately, their roster is already in a good place with essentially no major holes to fill. For general manager Andrew Berry, the 2024 NFL Draft is about adding depth.\n\nTo kick off NFL Draft week, NFL insider, Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated laid out all 32 team's biggest remaining needs. For the Browns that list included defensive line, interior offensive line, wide receiver and running back. In his explanation for what the Browns could look to do with their first pick at 54 overall, Breer said:\n\n\"The Browns are another team in the enviable position of being able to plan a year or two out, with a pretty complete roster devoid of major holes. They'd like to add a defensive tackle or two, putting guys such as Hall and Michigan's Kris Jenkins on the Day 2 radar, and landing a running back in the middle rounds, with Nick Chubb coming back from injury.\"\n\nJenkins Jr. is a player several draft experts have linked to the Browns throughout the offseason and a solid fit for Cleveland. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz loves to rotate his defensive lineman. Beyond defensive line though, Breer's list includes other notable needs like wide receiver and running back. Interior offensive line has popped up more recently as the Browns start planning for a future without Pro Bowl guard Joel Bitonio, at some point.\n\nBreer didn't mention linebacker as a position of need for Cleveland but that's another area where they could certainly explore adding via the draft.\n\nWhat do you think the Browns biggest need is going into the draft?\n\nBrowns Mock Draft 5.0: Cleveland's Front Office Gets Aggressive And Trades Up In Round Two\n\n4 Burning Browns Questions, Including: Will The Browns Trade Back In The Draft?\n\nKevin Stefanski Shouts Praise For New Browns Coach Mike Vrabel\n\nKevin Stefanski Won't Rush Into Naming Browns Play Caller For 2024 Season\n\nBrowns General Manager Andrew Berry Provides Update On Nick Chubb", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_german@si.com", "name": "Spencer German", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Bitonio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Bitonio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Schwartz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Schwartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Vrabel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Vrabel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_157/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw3jkjmvjwj4crtbrs", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Cleveland cruised into the playoffs despite starting four different quarterbacks and losing RB Nick Chubb in Week 2, resulting in Coach of the Year honors for Kevin Stefanski.\n\nExpectations are just as high in 2024, even with one of the NFL's toughest schedules on tap. Much of that hope hinges on QB Deshaun Watson, who is aiming to be healthy by September, but Cleveland has won with its depth before and is looking to add to a deep roster in the NFL Draft.\n\nThe Browns can find upgrades in the draft, but it will be tough to secure a sure-fire impact player without a first-round pick. Cleveland won't pick until deep into the second round Friday, so Thursday figures to be a quiet night for Browns faithful.\n\nHere's a look at the Browns' full slate of picks and why they don't have a first-round selection.\n\nThe Browns have their own second and third-round picks despite missing a first-rounder, but those are their only two selections within the top 150 picks. Cleveland only has three top-200 picks, so picks No. 54 and 85 will have extreme importance for GM Andrew Berry.\n\nThe Browns traded their 2024 first-round pick to the Texans in 2022 as part of their deal for QB Deshaun Watson. Cleveland traded three first-round picks in the deal for Watson, and this is the final one heading to Houston.\n\nWith that being said, the Texans already rerouted the pick to the Vikings in a pick swap. Minnesota landed the selection, which sits 23rd overall, in a move many believed was an attempt to build ammo for a trade up in the first round.\n\nRegardless of what the Vikings do with the pick, the Browns don't own it. Considering the Texans eliminated Cleveland from the playoffs, losing this year's pick might sting a bit more for Browns fans than it did in 2023 or 2024.\n\nThe Browns are set to own their first-round pick in 2025 with the Watson trade in the rearview mirror by that point. Whether Watson will still be a part of their long-term plans by that point remains to be seen.\n\nMORE: Which receivers could Browns target in NFL Draft?\n\nThe Browns are slated to make their first pick at No. 54 overall on Friday.\n\nCleveland owns two picks on Day 2: their own selections in the second and third round (No. 54 and No. 86). That means the Browns' choices likely won't be guaranteed to make an immediate impact, and having just six picks in the entire draft limits Berry's ability to make a significant trade up.\n\nThe Browns didn't pick until the third round last year, but they still added an early-career starter in Ohio State OT Dawand Jones. Berry will have to similarly look for gems this weekend, but owning a second-round pick gives Cleveland a better asset than it had in the 2023 draft.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Browns", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawand_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dawand Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2022-04/Andrew-Berry-041422-GETTY-FTR.jpg?itok=7Vmp8s-1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Later this week, the final two picks they gave the Houston Texans in the 2022 Deshaun Watson trade will be used. Next year, the Browns will have a first-round pick for the first time since 2021.\n\nFor now, they have six picks in this draft -- but just two in the top 150. They're slated to start their draft at No. 54 in the second round before picking again at No. 85 in the third. There's not one pressing need, and there's probably not an immediate starting spot available for a rookie added this weekend. But things change quickly, and Cleveland's pick count might change, too, if general manager Andrew Berry decides to trade down. He also hasn't made a second-round pick since 2021.\n\nWho might the Browns be targeting? Which names are obvious fits? Which ones might be a little less obvious? As the draft draws closer, here's how I view a working list of potential Browns picks. The key here is working. It will be updated throughout the first two days of the draft.\n\nDane Brugler, The Athletic's draft guru, has his rankings and full scouting reports in his monstrous NFL Draft guide, \"The Beast.\" What's here is based on Brugler's research, the Browns' past draft preferences, their current perceived needs and conversations with talent evaluators throughout the pre-draft season. Cleveland is in position to draft for the future.\n\nThese are best guesses. The Browns themselves aren't going to know which direction their draft will head until Friday night. Will Berry trade down and look to add more picks? Is there a big surprise in store? Let's get to the names.\n\nTroy Franklin, WR, Oregon\n\nBrugler projects him to go before No. 54 but gives him a second/third-round grade, and Franklin is not a finished product. I don't necessarily think the Browns view wide receiver as a top priority. But Franklin's upside could change that thinking if he's available.\n\nThe Browns' top three defensive tackles are in their 30s. Hall is a Cleveland native, and his upfield style fits Jim Schwartz's defense. Smith has a rare combination of size and athleticism but only played 22 college games and still needs to refine his skills. Hall is 20 and Smith is 21. If the Browns are looking to the future, their names stand out.\n\nThe Browns almost certainly will add a young prospect to their offensive line. But their top four offensive tackles are back, despite some injury uncertainty, so they might wait and see how things play out in the final year of Jedrick Wills Jr.'s rookie contract. If they want to add a tackle, it would make sense to add a young, developmental prospect like Fisher, Suamataia or Amegadjie. Fisher started his Notre Dame career at left tackle and played two seasons under new Browns tight ends coach Tommy Rees when he was the Fighting Irish's offensive coordinator.\n\nJa'Lynn Polk, WR, Washington\n\nHe's a big-play threat who just turned 22 and put together two big seasons to close his college career. Polk has good size and athletic testing numbers, and he's experienced playing both inside and outside.\n\nMalachi Corley, WR, Western Kentucky\n\nThere are a lot of wide receivers on this list. Corley is different because he's built like a running back and is best known as an after-the-catch producer. Some draftniks project him as a top-50 pick; others view him as a third-rounder. NFL Network reported that he was on the Browns' formal pre-draft list.\n\nChris Braswell, DE, Alabama\n\nBraswell had a big final season at Alabama and projects as a pass-down specialist in the NFL. The Browns could move Alex Wright to more of an inside role and continue to develop Braswell for the future, while immediately giving him some pass-down snaps.\n\nThink along the lines of Franklin. This would be a bet on the future, not necessarily 2024. Walker had a roller coaster of a college career but has the size and speed teams covet.\n\nA native Ohioan, Stover was productive at the college level and should be a solid pro. He doesn't wow anyone with his physical attributes, but he's a willing blocker and a reliable pass catcher. The Browns let backup tight end Harrison Bryant leave in free agency, and maybe adding another traditional tight end would allow super-freak David Njoku more flexibility to find favorable matchups across the formation.\n\nAudric Estime, RB, Notre Dame\n\nEstime is a power back who played two seasons under Rees at Notre Dame. There's little certain about the present or future of the Browns' running back room, so an addition this weekend wouldn't be a surprise.\n\nCedric Johnson, Edge, Ole Miss\n\nJohnson is young (21), athletic and his special teams experience includes a college blocked punt. He's still developing as a rusher despite having 19 sacks, and the Browns are looking for tools and upside in young defensive linemen.\n\nT'Vondre Sweat, DT, Texas\n\nSweat was considered a second-day prospect, but he refused to weigh in at the Senior Bowl and was later arrested on a DUI charge. He's expected to slip into the draft's final day, and it will be interesting to see which team takes a chance.\n\nBerry has selected an interior offensive lineman on the third day in three of his previous four drafts as general manager. He's selected multiple offensive linemen in two of his four drafts with Cleveland. Berry joked in January that the Browns were \"offensive line snobs,\" but he wasn't joking.\n\nJermaine Burton, WR, Alabama\n\nBurton was a big-time playmaker at the college level, but he also comes with some questions about his maturity and past behavior. Maybe being at six schools over the past eight years is just the way of the modern world, but NFL teams have been investigating deeply. They know he can play, and talent counts most.\n\nAinias Smith has an injury history, but he has real speed. Some team will take a chance on his upside during the draft's third day.\n\nHis brother, Christian McCaffrey, is a pretty decent player for the San Francisco 49ers. His dad, Ed, wasn't bad either. Luke McCaffrey was a heavily recruited quarterback who's only been a wide receiver for two seasons. The Browns saw him at the Senior Bowl, and Brugler projects him as a fifth-round pick.\n\nThink Derek Anderson. He can throw it a mile, but the shorter passes need work. The Browns have four quarterbacks on the roster for now, but the way things have gone at that position the last several years says further investment is likely -- and maybe wise.\n\nJordan Magee, LB, Temple\n\nThe Browns need depth in the linebacking corps, and they'll be looking for special teams experience with the new kickoff rule bringing returns back to the game.\n\nAli has been out since late January due to a Senior Bowl injury, but the graduate of Shaker Heights High School is known to NFL teams. Brugler has long believed that Ali will get drafted and have a chance to be an NFL contributor. Might it happen with his hometown team in the sixth or seventh round?\n\nThe lightning-fast Akron native has drawn plenty of attention since impressing at Toledo's pro day. Tipton has talked with the Browns, and he expects to get an NFL opportunity this summer either as a late-round pick or priority free agent.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news",

After trading their last three first round picks for quarterback Deshaun Watson back in 2022 though, the draft has become less of a spectacle in Northeast Ohio.\n\nWith the NFL world converging on Detroit for the 2024 NFL Draft, Cleveland enters the weekend with six total picks currently at their disposal. The first of those is in the second round at No. 54 overall, paving the way for a quiet opening night.\n\nJust because the draft may not carry as much weight to the current Browns as it used to for previous versions of the team, general manager Andrew Berry still has some needs to address across the roster.\n\nAs part of our coverage of the NFL Draft, Spencer German and Cole McDaniels provided a comprehensive preview of this weekend's festivities.\n\nFans have heard Cleveland linked to a number of different positions and players for their first pick on day two, but Cole has an interesting top priority for the Browns to target at 54. The guys talk about the wide receiver class and whether or not Cleveland still considers that position a major need after trading for Jerry Jeudy. They throw out plenty of names for Browns fans to be aware of and more.\n\nEnjoy our NFL draft preview show and stay tuned at the Browns Digest YouTube channel for NFL Draft content all weekend long, LIVE from Berea.\n\nBrowns Mock Draft 6.0: Cleveland Stays Put, Addresses Defensive Need at 54\n\nNFL Insider Albert Breer Highlights Browns Biggest Needs Ahead Of Draft\n\nWhy It Feels Inevitable The Browns Will Draft A Tight End This Weekend\n\nBrowns Mock Draft 5.0: Cleveland's Front Office Gets Aggressive And Trades Up In Round Two", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_german@si.com", "name": "Spencer German", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Ohio"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_297/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hwanhhmn73w406mn9w", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

It's gone.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns' franchise-shifting trade for quarterback Deshaun Watson two years ago has once again made the three-day draft almost an afterthought.\n\nLike fans across the league, the Browns will watch as players get picked on Day One again.\n\nFor the third straight year, Cleveland is without a first-round pick after shipping three of them along with a handful of late-round selections to the Houston Texas in 2022 for Watson, who has yet to deliver a championship or even a playoff win.\n\nWatson's two seasons with the Browns have been, well, incomplete.\n\nHe's played in just 12 games because of a league suspension and right shoulder injury, and there's no way to predict if he'll ever get back to Pro Bowl form, though he showed positive signs before getting hurt last season.\n\nThe team's massive investment into Watson affects every move the Browns make, and its reverberations are felt strongest on draft weekend.\n\nAs part of the blockbuster deal, Cleveland dealt its first- and fourth-round picks in 2024 to Houston for Watson, meaning the team's first selection won't be until the second round at No. 54 and they currently have just two picks in the first 150.\n\nThey'll next pick at No. 85 (third round) but not again until No. 156 (fifth round), a 71-player gap that will test the limits of general manager Andrew Berry's patience.\n\nHis track record is not to sit still.\n\n\"You guys probably know me well enough that we can always be moving around,\" Berry told reporters at the owner's meetings.\n\nBerry recently traded fifth- and sixth-round picks to Denver for wide receiver Jerry Jeudy, whose arrival lessens the likelihood the Browns will use No. 54 -- or move up -- to get another playmaker for Watson.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean Berry won't consider it.\n\nEverything is on the table for the Browns as they head into a make-or-break season, and owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam have green-lighted their front office to do whatever it feels necessary to make the team better.\n\nLinebacker has been a somewhat neglected spot for the Browns, who had the league's top-rated defense last season before a dreadful showing in a playoff loss to Houston.\n\nThe team's decision not to re-sign signal-caller Anthony Walker Jr. or Sione Takitaki has created a substantial void in experience and leadership. The Browns signed free agent Jordan Hicks to a two-year deal, but he'll be 32 in June and there's not enough depth to withstand the inevitable injuries.\n\nDON'T NEED\n\nThe quarterback room has gone from sparse to crowded. But as the Browns learned the hard way last season, you can never have enough QBs.\n\nWatson's recovery from shoulder surgery seems to be on schedule, but the team's decision to sign Jameis Winston and Tyler Huntley as backups raised some eyebrows. At the very least, they're proven insurance policies in case Watson isn't ready or goes down again.\n\nJoe Flacco came off the couch to save the Browns and lead them to the playoffs last season, but Berry wanted to have a safer plan heading into 2024.\n\nFRONT AND CENTER\n\nIt might be time for the Browns to do some rebuilding of their offensive line, which has been a strength in recent years.\n\nInjuries to starting tackles Jack Conklin and Jedrick Wills Jr. put the team in a serious bind last season, and the situation worsened when rookie Dawand Jones, who did a remarkable job filling in for Conklin, went down with a knee injury.\n\nConklin is expected to return, but the 29-year-old has been slowed by injuries in recent years. While Wills was playing well before he got hurt, he's been inconsistent since being drafted 10th overall in 2020.\n\nPro Bowlers Joel Bitonio and Wyatt Teller are two of the league's most agile guards and run blockers. But there isn't much quality depth behind them, and the Browns need to start thinking long-term up front.\n\nSECONDARY MARKET\n\nBrowns cornerback Greg Newsome II has spent the offseason deflecting rumors.\n\nHis name has been mentioned in trade rumors for months, and they've only intensified as the draft approaches. Newsome has mostly been able to block them out.\n\n\"I don't pay attention, but obviously my family and stuff tell me and ask me,\" the 2021 first-round pick said this week. \"I feel like AB (Berry) and the ownership and all my coaches know what I'm capable of, they know what I bring to this team.\"\n\nThe Browns have until May 2 to pick up the $13.7 million fifth-year option on his rookie contract. It's also possible they could agree to a long-term extension.\n\n\"That's the goal,\" Newsome said. \"I want to be one of those guys that sticks around one place their whole career. So if God be willing, I'll be here for a long time.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 8 News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox8.com", "name": "Associated

Jeremiah Owusu-Koromoah, Grant Delpit and Nick Chubb are among the Browns' current starters that were second rounders in their respective draft classes.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Delpit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Delpit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rounders"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WDJW5NIZNNDLLG3PKDXHNE436E.JPG?auth=5413cc8ad9c6eac54eec466b032bdd47af505b82bdee7aa5887ef3289c1d275f&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Last time, I had general manager Andrew Berry get extra aggressive moving up and down the board multiple times. This time, Berry's aggressiveness is still on display, but it's a little more subdued, starting with him actually staying put in the second round and making a pick at 54.\n\nThis mock covers all the bases for Cleveland in terms of addressing needs as well, which should satisfy fans. With the NFL Draft officially just a day away, the Browns will be on the clock soon enough making actual picks. In the meantime, here is our Mock Draft 6.0.\n\nThe streak of trading out of the second round ends as Berry selects Michigan defensive tackle Kris Jenkins Jr. at 54 overall. This is right around the sweat spot that Jenkins should go and it's a need for the Browns. At 300 pounds, he will serve as a valuable space eater in the NFL.\n\nWith the Browns he'd have the luxury of learning from a solid group of veterans ahead of him on the depth chart, but would still see plenty of playing time in Jim Schwartz defense that requires plenty of rotating bodies along the defensive front. He possesses a favorable blend of size and athleticism that should see him become a starter in the trenches one day. This feels like the right pick for how the board fell for Cleveland.\n\nHere's that Berry aggressiveness on display as he moves back from 85 overall, trading that pick and their second seventh rounder (No. 243) to Tampa Bay for pick 89 and pick 125. When the Browns are finally up four picks later, they select the son of Eagles legend, Jeremiah Trotter.\n\nThere hasn't been a ton of buzz linking Cleveland to Trotter Jr. It's a position the Browns could certainly use some more depth though. Trotter Jr. brings a high football IQ and play diagnosis abilities to the NFL. He also holds his own in pass coverage. Wherever he ends up, he has a chance to be an inside linebacker of the future.\n\nCleveland uses the other pick they acquired in the trade with Tampa Bay to select Estime, who they met with at The NFL Combine. Given the unknown of Nick Chubb, who is returning from a serious knee injury, I think the Browns are going to look to inject some fresh blood into the running back room and see if they can find a future starter.\n\nEstime possesses more of a power running style than a finesse one. I like other running back prospects better than him but the interest in Estime is there for the Browns.\n\nRichardson made a top-30 visit to Berea during the last several weeks, so there's an obvious interest there. Berry also has never not drafted a defensive back since becoming the Browns GM in 2020 so it makes sense.\n\nDespite not being a day one guy, the Mississippi State product has put some impressive things on tape. This is right around the round and pick he's supposed to go so expect him to be on Cleveland's radar going into day three of the draft.\n\nReiman hasn't visited with the Browns but if they miss out on guys like Erick All out of Iowa or Ja'Tavion Sanders out of Texas in the earlier rounds, Reiman feels like a guy you could take a flier on late and try to develop.\n\nThe upside with Reiman is that he's already a really good blocker. Maybe even the best blocking TE In the class. He's also shows that he has really strong hands for pass catching. That said, he's still a project that needs some developing at the net level as to become a more reliable threat in some team's passing attack.\n\nIt wouldn't be a Berry draft if it didn't include a wide receiver. Here Berry goes back to the Mississippi State well to snag finally add to the Browns wide receiver room, snagging \"Tulu\" Griffin who came to Berea on a pre-draft visit.\n\nGriffin is a speedster, who posted a 4.43 forty time at the NFL Combine. Teams will always make room for lightening quick receivers on their roster, even if they need to be developed. That's the case for Griffin, who is a developmental project. He'll likely be stuck as a slot receiver in the NFL just given his height and weight restrictions, but if he can put on some muscle he had a chance to be a consistent weapon at the next level.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_german@si.com", "name": "Spencer German", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Trotter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremiah Trotter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenkins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kris Jenkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Schwartz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Schwartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Tavion_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Tavion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_All", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erick All"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2400,h_1350,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw79rdtf9z738qfky7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Given their six Day 3 picks in a class with the lowest number of participants in the history of the draft, general manager Andrew Berry may even have the incentive to package them up and make a move up the board for the first time since 2021.\n\nTheir last year with no first round selection, the Browns do not come onto the clock until the middle part of the second round after making the postseason a year ago. Berry and the Browns have had great success with their mid-round picks in recent drafts, landing the likes of linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah in the second round, cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. and defensive end Alex Wright in the third round, and offensive tackle Dawand Jones in the fourth round.\n\nWhen they come on the clock with pick No. 54 on Friday night, who are the best prospects for the Browns to pick from a scheme and profile perspective? Here are five ideal selections Berry and his team could target this weekend.\n\n1. WR Keon Coleman, Florida State\n\nNov 18, 2023; Tallahassee, Florida, USA; Florida State Seminoles wide receiver Keon Coleman (4) celebrates a touchdown against the North Alabama Lions during the third quarter at Doak S. Campbell Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Morgan Tencza-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPerhaps the most overthought player in the entire 2024 NFL draft, Florida State Keon Coleman checks off every box the Browns would look for in an early selection.\n\nEarly production: Check.\n\nColeman was a standout for Michigan State in 2022 before transferring to Florida State, where he was the leading receiver for the pass-lacking Seminoles.\n\nAge: Check.\n\nEntering the draft at just 20 years of age, Coleman is one of the youngest players to hear his name called this year. The benefit of this is potentially hitting that second contract by the time he is just 24 years old, and potentially a third contract by age 28.\n\nGame speed data: Check.\n\nWhile Coleman ran a 4.6 40-yard at the NFL Scouting Combine, a drill that is rendered predominantly obsolete, he was one of the fastest and smoothest players when working through live drills in Indianapolis. Pair this with his 93rd percentile ranking in in-game play speed data according to PFF, and there is nothing to worry about in terms of Coleman's ability to win on the field.\n\nPremium Position: Check.\n\nOutside of the quarterback position, offensive tackle, cornerback, edge rusher, and wide receiver are seen as the premium positions. The Browns have never selected a player who did not play a premium position with their first selection under general manager Andrew Berry. Do not expect that to change this year (with potentially a couple of exceptions).\n\nThe stars aligned for the Browns to trade up for linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah in the 2021 NFL draft, and the draft profile of Coleman makes him a prime candidate for the Browns to come up and get if he begins to slip far enough down the board.\n\n2. OT Kingsley Suamataia, BYU\n\nOct 21, 2023; Provo, Utah, USA; Brigham Young Cougars offensive lineman Kingsley Suamataia (78) prepares to block against the Texas Tech Red Raiders in the first half at LaVell Edwards Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rob Gray-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Browns currently have three starting-caliber offensive tackles on their roster and another who has started double-digit games for the Browns throughout their careers. The problem? Two of them are free agents after the season, and one is coming off of his second major injury in three years and is not a lock to be on the roster by the end of training camp.\n\nJedrick Wills and James Hudson III (their swing tackle) have a lot of starting experience, and Jack Conklin is likely near the end of his time with the Browns. This leaves just second-year player Dawand Jones as the only long-term figure at the offensive tackle position beyond 2024. While Wills could still have a nice year, turn it around, and earn an extension, it may be time to plan for life without him given his sample size the last three seasons after a promising rookie campaign.\n\nWhile a run on offensive tackles could push him up the board into the range of an early second round pick, BYU's Kingsley Suamataia would be a stellar selection for the Browns. He is the most likely pick for the Browns according to ESPN Analytics as well.\n\nHe is a bit raw, but the beauty of the strategy the Browns employ in the draft of drafting for the future and not for today is that Suamataia would not be rushed into action right away barring an injury. If the Browns plan for life after Wills, Conklin, and Hudson III early in the 2024 NFL draft, Suamataia is a prime target.\n\n3. LB Junior Colson, Michigan\n\nJan 8, 2024; Houston, TX, USA; Michigan Wolverines linebacker Junior Colson (25) against the Washington Huskies during the 2024 College Football Playoff national championship game at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Browns replaced Anthony Walker Jr. with Jordan Hicks on a two-year deal. They replaced Sione Takitaki with former first round pick Devin Bush on a one-year deal (who is not a lock to make the roster, by the way). They have a Pro Bowl WILL linebacker in Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah.\n\nHowever, finding a long-term running mate for Owusu-Koramoah who isn't a short-term veteran like Hicks may rise to the top of the list for the Browns. Besides, it worked out pretty well for them the last time they drafted a linebacker in the second round.\n\nAnd Michigan's Junior Colson may just be too tempting to pass up if he's on the board.\n\nMissing less than five percent of his tackles a year ago, he is as sure of a tackler as they come from the college level. At 6-foot-2 and 238 pounds as well, Colson has just what the Browns look for as their long-term MIKE linebacker who can make an impact in a limited role as a rookie as he learns under Hicks.\n\nThe Browns typically look for linebackers with low missed tackle rates to play MIKE, and Colson is the ideal player in this class to hit that benchmark. His athleticism and ability to get sideline-to-sideline is icing on the cake.\n\n4. DT Michael Hall, Ohio State\n\nNov 25, 2023; Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA; Ohio State Buckeyes defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr. (51) celebrates a sack of Michigan Wolverines quarterback J.J. McCarthy (9) during the first half of the NCAA football game at Michigan Stadium.\n\nDefensive coordinator Jim Schwartz loves him an explosive, gap-shooting pass rusher. And Ohio State's Michael Hall Jr. is just that. While he admittedly has some work to do as a run defender and in his ability to leverage out gaps to keep second-level defenders clean, there are few better pass rushers in this crop of interior defensive linemen. And two of them likely go first round in Texas' Byron Murphy II and Illinois' Jer'Zhan Newton.\n\nBy every advanced metric, Hall is a menace at getting after quarterbacks. While he accumulated just three sacks this past season for the Buckeyes, he was second of all college football defensive tackles in pass rush win rate a year ago, and sixth in pass rush productivity.\n\nWith Maurice Hurst on just a one-year deal, Shelby Harris on a two-year deal, and Quinton Jefferson on a one-year deal, another body is likely to be added to the defensive tackle room. Hall would be an outstanding fit for what he asks of his defensive tackles.\n\n5. OG Christian Haynes, UConn\n\nNov 18, 2023; East Hartford, Connecticut, USA; UConn Huskies wide receiver Brett Buckman (10) is congratulated after his touchdown by offensive lineman Christian Haynes (64) against the Sacred Heart Pioneers in the second half at Rentschler Field at Pratt & Whitney Stadium. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAn absolute mauler with plenty of starting experience in the outside zone run scheme, UConn's Christian Haynes is a certified people-mover. With a firm base and strong hands in pass protection as well, Haynes has the makings of a day-one starter and a long-time fit along the Cleveland offensive line.\n\nThe beauty, however, is that the Browns would not need the UConn standout to play right away. But there is a strong chance they are already thinking about the future of their interior offensive line.\n\nJoel Bitonio, as rock solid as he has been, is on the wrong side of 30 and suffered the first significant injury of his career last year. While that injury could have been a fluke, it was evident a year ago that time is starting to catch up to Bitionio. Wyatt Teller was the Browns' best offensive lineman a year ago and has yet to hit 30, so there is no need to rush him off the roster at this point.\n\nThere is no better contingency plan for this offense in this draft class along the interior offensive line than Haynes.", "source": {"uri": "brownswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Browns Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The second is who will be the team's No. 1 wide receiver if Cleveland doesn't extend Amari Cooper, who is entering the final year of his deal in 2024?\n\nJake Trotter of ESPN on Wednesday, April 23 authored a deep dive into why the second query could very well dictate the Browns' approach to the draft.\n\n\"As successful as the Cooper trade has been, [GM Andrew] Berry and the Browns have otherwise struggled in targeting receivers. That has left them without an obvious No. 1 heir apparent to Cooper, who turns 30 this summer and has ended the past two seasons battling nagging injuries,\" Trotter wrote. \"And that is why, once again, receiver could be one of the positions to watch Friday night on Day 2 of the draft when the Browns make their first two picks, coming in at No. 54 and No. 85 overall.\"\n\nCleveland made something of a splash move at the position already this offseason, fashioned in the image of the deal it executed for Cooper two offseasons past.\n\nThe Browns sent a fifth-round pick and a sixth-round pick in this year's draft to the Denver Broncos in return for the final year of Jerry Jeudy's rookie deal, then extended the wideout on a three-year contract worth $52.5 million.\n\nCleveland flipped a fifth-rounder and a sixth-round pick swap to the Dallas Cowboys in 2022 for the final three years of Cooper's $100 million contract. He will carry a salary cap hit of $23.7 million next season if the Browns don't restructure Cooper's deal and/or extend him on a multiyear deal.\n\n\"As it stands, Jeudy could be Cleveland's No. 1 receiver going into the 2025 season, especially if the Browns don't extend Cooper, who is entering the final year of his deal (Cleveland is already projected to be the most expensive team in the NFL in 2024),\" Trotter wrote. \"The jury is out on whether Jeudy, who turns 25 this week, can still develop into that caliber of receiver. The jury is also out on whether any of Cleveland's other receivers, notably [Elijah] Moore or [Cedric] Tillman, can develop into reliable complementary starters.\"\n\nExtending Cooper makes sense considering how well he's played since arriving in Cleveland, with 2,410 receiving yards and 14 TD receptions on 150 catches over 32 games played, per Pro Football Reference. A new deal will also allow the Browns to lower his cap number significantly this year.\n\nHowever, doing so will push even more money down the line, increasing tomorrow's tab on today's players along with the pressure on Cleveland to win big right now. Extending Cooper is also a significant risk considering his age and recent injury concerns, which Trotter detailed.\n\nThe Browns have gone wide receiver in the third round of each of the previous two drafts, selecting Tillman 74th overall in 2023 out of Tennessee and David Bell 99th overall out of Purdue in 2022. While they appear to have come up short in both of those efforts, at least so far, some draft experts have predicted the Browns to look receiver somewhat early again this time around.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. and Field Yates projected Cleveland to select Troy Franklin out of Oregon with the 54th pick in their latest alternating joint mock draft on April 15.\n\n\"The Browns traded for Jerry Jeudy this offseason, but they still feel one wide receiver short on offense, especially since Amari Cooper is entering the final year of his deal,\" Yates wrote. \"Franklin is a speedy big play waiting to happen.\"\n\nFranklin, 21 years old, stands at 6-feet, 3-inches tall and weighs 187 pounds.

However, Cleveland needs to start thinking about the future and the Oregon prospect makes sense for the Browns.\n\nFranklin is coming off a strong season with the Oregon Ducks. He made 81 catches for 1,383 yards and 14 touchdowns. He can stretch the field and spend at least a year learning from Cooper, who is known as one of the best route-runners in the NFL.\n\nThe Athletic's Zac Jackson has the Browns selecting Franklin with their second-round pick at No. 54.\n\n\"The Browns have options in this draft, and they don't need a wide receiver. But with Amari Cooper and Elijah Moore only under contract through 2024, it would make sense that they take a shot on one -- and Franklin seems to have a high ceiling. Franklin, 21, was mocked as a possible late first-round pick in December and January. But he weighed only 176 at the NFL combine (he was up to 187 at Oregon's pro day), and it's worth noting that he dropped more passes (nine) last season than he did in his previous two college seasons combined. Franklin needs to add strength and refine his game, but Cleveland is in position to be patient and potentially find a long-time starter.\"\n\nThe Browns have made it a point to give quarterback Deshaun Watson all the weapons he needs to propel the passing game. Cooper, Moore and Jeudy were all acquired via trade and the Browns see a lot of upside with that trio.\n\nBut Franklin's addition could make an instant impact for the Browns, who lack a receiver who can stretch the field. At one point, the hope was Anthony Schwartz could become that. Schwartz was cut last August. The Browns tried again with veteran Marquise Goodwin, but he was limited to just four catches last season.\n\nNFL.com's Lance Zierlein projects that Franklin will go in the second round and sees Chris Olave as his pro comparison.\n\n\"The puzzle pieces are fairly easy to put together when assessing who Franklin is and who he could be in the NFL. He's a tall, linear receiver with good speed. He's sudden enough to beat press but lacks the play strength to win combat catches and fight for operating space underneath. He has an innate talent for avoiding traffic and maintaining his distance from pursuit after the catch on crossing routes on all three levels. Franklin might not get WR1 target volume, but he should be productive with a high yards-per-catch average and the ability to open things up underneath for his teammates. Franklin could become a coveted complementary piece for an established WR1 or a productive vertical target for a team looking for instant help in the passing game.\"\n\nThe Browns have not had much success drafting wide receivers, although some of that story is still to be written. Cedric Tillman and David Bell were both third-round picks in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Neither has found a significant role in the offense yet.\n\nBoth Cooper and Moore are heading into the final years of their contracts. As Jackson mentions, the Browns need to consider that in the draft with someone like Franklin.\n\nCooper is coming off a Pro Bowl season with the Browns. He registered a career-high 1,250 yards on 72 receptions with 5 touchdowns. He will turn 30 this offseason but has shown no signs of slowing down. Cooper is also a no-nonsense pass-catcher who meshes well with the culture in Cleveland.\n\nCooper has been a low-maintenance, reliable star in Cleveland. The Browns would like to keep him around as long as they can.\n\n\"Look, Coop's a Pro Bowl-caliber receiver,\" Berry said, per Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com. \"He's played really well for us the past two years. He's a strong presence in the locker room. We love him. So players like that, you want to make sure that you can retain as long as possible and we'll work through all of that at the appropriate times.\"\n\nThe story is a little different for Moore. He had a career year with the Browns following the trade. Moore notched 59 catches for 640 yards. However, he'll have to take the next step to prove to the Browns that he should stick around.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Ducks football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Schwartz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Schwartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Olave", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Olave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquise_Goodwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marquise Goodwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Tillman_(American_football,_born_2000)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Tillman (American football, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Development_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Development Agencies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Cooperatives", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Computer_and_Internet", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Computer and Internet", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1750431305-e1713997395737.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

In 2024, the Browns roster is in a much better place than previous iterations.\n\nThe 22 starters on offense and defense are essentially accounted for, minus a few minor questions along the offensive line. That means the Browns can focus this year's draft on adding depth at a number of positions, rather than finding a frontline starter - something that would be hard to do without a first round pick anyway.\n\nWhile defensive tackle, wide receiver and running back have been some of the top positions groups linked to the Browns via the draft, one that had flown a bit under the radar as a potential area of focus in tight end.\n\nFor starters, the Browns lost 2020 draftee, TE Harrison Bryant in free agency last month, creating a void further down the depth chart after David Njoku. Former Texans TE Jordan Akin remains under contract for this upcoming season behind Njoku, but could be released for a minimal dead cap hit. Cleveland also signed former Panthers fullback and tight end Giovanni Ricci this offseason as well.\n\nEven with Ken Dorsey joining the fold to help draw up a new offense alongside Kevin Stefanski, the organization still values the tight end position, and having a young one to try and develop is something they're likely to prioritize.\n\nThere's some juice behind the teams interest in tight ends too as two notable names were reported to have made top 30 pre-draft visits to Berea in Iowa product Erick All and Texas product Ja'Tavion Sanders. Both players are projected as day two picks.\n\nAll enters the NFL with a pretty versatile skillset as both a physical blocker but nice off the snap burst to be a downfield threat. Still, there's some rawness to his game and he'd remain a bit of a project to develop.\n\nSanders on the other hand is considered one of the top five tight ends coming out of the college ranks. He has flashed on tape an athletic passing game weapon but leaves some room for improvement as a blocker. Perhaps working with Njoku, who has slowly developed into one of the best blocking tight ends in the league would do him some good.\n\nUltimately, the tight end position may not even up being.a top priority for Cleveland until day three of the draft. If so, another name to keep in mind is TIp Reiman out of Illinois, who may just be the best blocker of the class. He'd be a project, but frankly, so was Bryant coming out of college and he wound up carving out a nice role for himself in the Browns offense over the last few years.\n\nTight end may not be at the top of the menu in terms of things general manager Andrew Berry feels they need to address later this week. But it shouldn't be surprising if he ends up snagging one before the weekend comes to a close.\n\nNFL Insider Albert Breer Highlights Browns Biggest Needs Ahead Of Draft\n\nBrowns Mock Draft 5.0: Cleveland's Front Office Gets Aggressive And Trades Up In Round Two\n\n4 Burning Browns Questions, Including: Will The Browns Trade Back In The Draft?\n\nKevin Stefanski Shouts Praise For New Browns Coach Mike Vrabel", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_german@si.com", "name": "Spencer German", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_All", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erick All"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fullback (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Dorsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Dorsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Vrabel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Vrabel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4754,h_2674,x_0,y_73/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw65fxxdbsm4gwm4wz", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Three of the 32 teams in the league currently do not have a first-round selection, though, any of those could decide to trade into the first round should they be interested in doing so.\n\nOne of those teams without a first-round pick is the Cleveland Browns, who will be without a first-round selection for the third consecutive season, barring a trade. In fact, the first selections the Browns made in each of the last two NFL drafts came in the third rounds.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about why the Cleveland Browns don't have a first-round pick.\n\nThe short answer is Deshaun Watson. In March 2022, the then-Houston Texans quarterback had a change of heart and agreed to waive his no-trade clause so that the Browns could acquire him in a deal that shipped three first-round draft picks (in the 2022, 2023 and 2024), one third-round selection (2023) and one fourth-round selection (2024) to Houston. The Browns did receive a 2024 fifth-round selection as part of a late-pick swap in the deal.\n\nThe Browns also gave Watson a five-year, fully-guaranteed $230 million contract as part of the deal. According to Pro Football Talk, Watson is guaranteed to receive $46 million in each of the following three seasons. The Browns gave Watson this deal despite him being sued by 24 women alleging sexual misconduct in massage sessions in 2020 and early 2021 during the quarterback's time in Houston. Five months after the Browns traded for Watson, the NFL suspended him 11 games and fined him $5 million for violations of the league's personal conduct policy.\n\nIn two seasons for the Browns, Watson has appeared in only 12 games and has completed 59.8% of his passes, for 2,217 yards, 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions. His quarterback ratings of 79.1 and 84.3 are both well below his previous career low in Houston, 98, which was achieved in the 2019 season. Cleveland has posted an 8-4 record in games Watson has started.\n\nWatson underwent shoulder surgery after sustaining an injury in November that sidelined him for the rest of the 2023 season. In his place, the Browns brought in veteran Joe Flacco, who sparked a playoff run and earned him the 2023 AP Comeback Player of the Year award.\n\nHouston has become rather competitive in a quick turnaround, thanks in part to the picks acquired in the Watson deal. Either directly with the picks Cleveland sent, or by packaging some of those picks in different trades, the Texans have added linebacker Will Anderson Jr., receiver Tank Dell and running back Dameon Pierce.\n\nAnderson Jr. (No. 3 overall in 2023) had a monster rookie season, generating 45 tackles, seven sacks and 22 quarterback hits, which earned him a Pro Bowl nomination and the 2023 AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award. Dell (No. 69 overall, in the third round) had a breakout rookie campaign in 2023, catching 47 passes for 709 yards and seven touchdowns in 11 games before a broken leg prematurely ended his season. Pierce (No. 107 overall, in the fourth round of the 2022 draft) has had a solid run, generating 1,621 yards from scrimmage and seven total touchdowns on 408 touches.\n\nThe Browns currently have six draft picks available in the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nYes, the Houston Texans and Carolina Panthers are also without their first-round selections because of different trades they made. It is not uncommon for a small number of teams each year to be without their first-round draft picks.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Anderson_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Anderson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dameon_Pierce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dameon Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YiTIl16_n1EM2xE0TFyG6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/a2a383f4c7dc6945c1d88620168e19e9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

While they are still stuck with the former for three more years, Cooper is in the final year of his contract. Some believe they could use their top pick -- in the second round -- to find his long-term replacement.\n\nIn addition to Cooper, the Browns have also traded for Elijah Moore and Jerry Jeudy at the wide receiver position. They just added Jeudy last month, and gave him a three-year, $58 million extension, which they may well regret.\n\nCooper has been productive, but is expensive, has dealt with injuries in Cleveland (despite missing just two games), and turns 30 in June. Meanwhile, the Browns have had no success drafting receivers with Cedric Tillman, David Bell, and Anthony Schwartz in recent years.\n\nJake Trotter for ESPN writes that the Browns have no \"obvious No. 1 heir apparent to Cooper\". He questions whether the team will sign him to an extension before his current contract runs out. After all, they already invested in Jeudy, and they have one of the most expensive rosters in the league.\n\nTurning over the roster with cheap draft picks is now the norm in the NFL. The value of veterans continues to skyrocket commensurate with the salary cap, and Cooper should still command a considerable salary. He's currently playing out the final year of a five-year, $100 million contract Cleveland inherited from the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nDuring his two seasons with the Browns, Cooper has caught 150 passes for 2,410 yards and 14 touchdowns. He is the first receiver to record back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in franchise history and made the Pro Bowl in 2023.\n\nSo why would they move arguably their best player on offense, barring a healthy Nick Chubb, after this season? Well, perhaps they question his durability moving forward following his recently bouts with injuries. Perhaps they understand the economics don't work out with the rest of their roster construction.\n\nAnd no doubt it's simply part of the draft process. The wide receiver position is particularly deep this year, even relative to recent years. It seems every year is a deep wide receiver class, but this year goes above and beyond the recent average.\n\nAnd with no first-round pick thanks to the Watson trade, there's a very good chance a wide receiver is the best player available at pick 54. By and large, they've done a good job filling holes in their roster, so they don't have any screaming needs. They certainly have some wants, like another linebacker or defensive lineman. But you're not taking either of those positions in this second round in this class, not with this year's receivers.\n\nRelated Items:Amari Cooper, Cleveland Browns, Jake Trotter Recommended for you Former Browns WR Rashard Higgins Says Team 'Partied Like It Was 1999' After Beating Steelers In Playoffs Browns QB Deshaun Watson Hoping To Participate In OTAs, Won't Rush Process Rashard Higgins, Christian Kirksey To Retire As Cleveland Browns", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Tillman_(American_football,_born_2000)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Tillman (American football, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Schwartz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Schwartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashard_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rashard Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Patrick-Peterson-Amari-Cooper-catch.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

That savvy move preceded the blockbuster trades for All-Pro receivers Tyreek Hill and Davante Adams, who both went for a multitude of picks days later.\n\nCooper has since become the first Cleveland player to post back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Last year, he also broke a franchise single-game record with 265 receiving yards in a win against the Houston Texans on the way to a fifth Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nYet as successful as the Cooper trade has been, Berry and the Browns have otherwise struggled in targeting receivers. That has left them without an obvious No. 1 heir apparent to Cooper, who turns 30 this summer and has ended the past two seasons battling nagging injuries. And that is why, once again, receiver could be one of the positions to watch Friday night on Day 2 of the draft when the Browns make their first two picks, coming in at No. 54 and No. 85 overall.\n\nSince taking over as GM in 2020, Berry has expended precious draft and financial capital attempting to bolster the receiver room. In the last three drafts, he's used a third-round pick on a receiver (Cedric Tillman, David Bell and Anthony Schwartz). Before that, in his first draft, Berry took Donovan Peoples-Jones in the sixth round.\n\nDPJ won a starting job in but was eventually jettisoned to the Detroit Lions before last year's trade deadline for another sixth-round pick. Schwartz started Cleveland's opener in 2021 but was cut during training camp last year. Bell has settled in a reserve role in the rotation. Tillman caught only 21 passes last year as a rookie, even after starting three games following the DPJ trade.\n\nThe Browns also traded for Elijah Moore last offseason, sending the Jets a second-round pick, while getting back a third (that was used on Tillman). But Moore had more than 61 receiving yards in a game only once last season (83 yards against the Los Angeles Rams in quarterback Joe Flacco's first Cleveland start).\n\nEarlier this offseason, the Browns took a shot on another buy-low receiver in Jerry Jeudy, a former first-round pick who had fallen out of favor with the Denver Broncos. Though Jeudy has never delivered a 1,000-yard season with the Broncos, the Browns gave him a three-year, $58 million extension after the trade. As it stands, Jeudy could be Cleveland's No. 1 receiver going into the 2025 season, especially if the Browns don't extend Cooper, who is entering the final year of his deal (Cleveland is already projected to be the most expensive team in the NFL in 2024).\n\nThe jury is out on whether Jeudy, who turns 25 this week, can still develop into that caliber of receiver. The jury is also out on whether any of Cleveland's other receivers, notably Moore or Tillman, can develop into reliable complementary starters.\n\nUsing another pick on a receiver would cost Cleveland an opportunity to add a promising prospect at another position. The Browns, after all, have suffered from not having a first- or second-round pick the last two drafts, due in large part to the 2022 trade that landed quarterback Deshaun Watson. But this also appears to be another loaded receiver draft, which could entice the Browns to roll the dice on yet another receiver on Day 2.\n\nCleveland has no shot at landing any of the top three receivers in this class in Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., LSU's Malik Nabers and Washington's Rome Odunze, who all appear locks to go in the top 10. But several talented pass-catchers could be available in Round 2, including Georgia's Ladd McConkey, who is a premier route runner, Texas' Xavier Worthy, who shattered combine records with a 40-yard dash time of 4.21 seconds, and Oregon's Troy Franklin, who has shown he can make contested catches. Florida State's Keon Coleman, Florida's Ricky Pearsall and Michigan's Roman Wilson, among others, all appear to have the potential to be starting NFL receivers, as well.\n\nThanks to ownership's spending and other shrewd moves Cleveland's front office has made, the Browns don't have many obvious short-term needs. Receiver, however, remains a glaring question mark, both this year and beyond.\n\nThe Browns could bank on the players they already have at the position. Or, on Friday, they could take another much-needed swing.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I have been and am still a firm believer that Andrew Berry and his staff will stay put at pick 54 or trade back.\n\nOn Sunday, our own Spencer German had the Browns trading back with the Lions at pick 61 and then selecting Malachi Corley of Western Kentucky. If the talented receiver is still available at that time, I would be thrilled. However, Corley's stock has only risen in recent times and I truly believe most tier one and tier two receivers will be selected even by pick 54.\n\nBased on how I expect the board to fall and my firm belief that the Browns should target the top of the wide receiver market with their first round selection next year, this could be the year of Berry not selecting a receiver on night two as we have typically come to expect.\n\nIn this mock draft, I decided to run a simulation of what may happen if the organization decides to surprise us and trade up.\n\nTRADE - Round 2, Pick 43: Trey Benson - RB, Florida State\n\nBenson is truly the only foreseeable reason for the Browns to trade up in the 2024 NFL Draft. With both Nick Chubb and Nyheim Hines recovering from major knee injuries and surgeries, Jerome Ford and D'Onta Foreman are the only two running backs with guarantees to be ready for the start of the season. In addition to potentially being thin at the position in September and possibly October this year, Chubb may not be back in Cleveland in 2025. The closer we get to the draft, the more inevitable a running back selection looks whether that comes as early as round two or as late as round seven.\n\nBenson is my number one running back prospect and likely sits atop draft boards for several running back needy teams. The New York Giants sit at pick 47 and are reportedly very interested in the former Florida State running back. The Dallas Cowboys are in major need of a starting running back and are candidates to trade up in the second round for a top running back prospect. In order to land Benson, a player Cleveland hosted recently for a top-30 visit, they trade up to pick 43 with the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons now drop back to pick 54 and also receive the newly acquired seventh-round selection from Tennessee (pick 227) and a 2025 third-round selection.\n\nAssuming that Nick Chubb is not ready to go by week one, the Browns will begin the 2024 season operating with a one-two punch of Trey Benson and Jerome Ford. Benson would be the workhorse on first and second down with Ford stealing some occasional carries and the majority of third-down work. D'Onta Foreman would then be able to offer some reps in short-yardage situations as the bruiser. If Cleveland makes this move, the writing is likely on the wall that Chubb will be elsewhere in 2025.\n\nRound 3, Pick 85: Kiran Amegadjie - OT, Yale\n\nThe chances of selecting a defensive tackle on night two is high, however, in this scenario Michael Hall Jr., Braden Fiske, Maason Smith and Ruke Orhorhoro have already been selected. Those are just a few of the many names off the board, really thinning out the position group. Cleveland's need at defensive tackle is really for 2025, so they could easily manage this year without addressing that position if they don't like the options available.\n\nInstead, remaining with the third-round selection from my previous mock draft makes the most sense. Amegadjie will add needed depth to an offensive tackle room where three players suffered season-ending knee injuries last season. Not only will the depth behind Jack Conklin, Dawand Jones, Jedrick Wills Jr. and newly acquired Hakeem Adeniji be important in 2024, but Amegadjie may actually get a chance to start at left tackle in 2025.\n\nRound 5, Pick 156: Javion Cohen - OG, Miami FL\n\nI recently wrote about the addition of Germain Ifedi meaning that the Browns could wait for interior offensive line depth until day three. This group of centers and guards may actually be the weakest position group in the entire 2024 draft class. Despite reportedly not meeting with many guard prospects, added depth at the spot would be helpful. Cleveland has shown some interest in Cohen and hosted him on a top-30 visit a few weeks back.\n\nCohen is one of the better guards in this year's class, yet due to the strength at other positions, interior o-linemen begin to slide. By potentially getting a steal in the fifth round, the Browns can feel good about the future of their offensive line. Cohen would likely go behind Joel Bitonio and Michael Dunn at left guard on the depth chart. Not only would he get time to develop, but in a pinch, Cohen could slide inside to center in the event that Ethan Pocic and Luke Wypler are unavailable.\n\nRound 6, Pick 206: Erick All - TE, Iowa\n\nOnce again, Erick All is available in the sixth round and becomes a member of the Cleveland Browns. The former Michigan and Iowa tight end, will get the opportunity to compete for the second tight end spot behind David Njoku. At this point, I would be shocked to not see All become a member of the Browns by the end of this week.\n\nRound 7, Pick 243: Steele Chambers - LB, Ohio State\n\nOhio State players have turned into valuable Cleveland Browns in recent history, making this selection much easier for Andrew Berry. I would be a little surprised to see Chambers available towards the end of the draft, but he is still raw at the position, potentially causing the availability. The former running back converted to linebacker for the Buckeyes and played well as a member of the silver bullets. He is still learning and developing better instincts at the position. Due to the athleticism of Chambers, he may be nowhere close to his ceiling yet.\n\nTaking a late-round flyer on Chambers makes sense for Cleveland schematically. The Browns usually are playing with just two linebackers on the field at a time, the same type of scheme Chambers has grown accustomed to at Ohio State. Not only can he play physical against the run but he can also cover ground sideline-to-sideline. In the first year or two, the biggest impact Chambers could make is on special teams. With the new kickoff rules, linebackers may be extremely valuable in kick coverage. Having a mobile, physical tackler could eliminate the threat of big plays on kickoffs.\n\nIf this is how the 2024 NFL Draft goes for the Browns, then wide receiver and defensive tackle will become priorities in 2025 free agency or the 2025 NFL Draft. Once this year's draft ends though, do not be surprised if the Browns add undrafted free agents like Yale wide receiver Mason Tipton or Georgia defensive tackle Zion Logue. Tipton is a local product from Akron, who played his high school football at Archbishop Hoban. Also, Logue has the potential to go undrafted but could add some value as depth in a 4-3 base scheme.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors":

Unfortunately, Cleveland does not have a first round pick.\n\nThe selection and write-up were made by Slaytanic Brownie:\n\n\"Michael Dean Perry walks to the podium and says with the 54th pick in the 2024 NFL draft, the Cleveland Browns select Defensive Tackle Michael Hall Jr. from The Ohio State University....\n\nWith one of the most solid starting rosters in the NFL, the Browns are in a blessed position of being able to draft depth and for the future. Hall Jr is a guy that has freaky speed (4.78) and athleticism (33 inch vertical) and was playing out of position at NT during the 23 season. Since the Browns have a couple of huge tackles with Tomlinson and Ika to absorb multiple lineman, Hall Jr. can be the other defensive lineman that disrupts everything and finally gets pressure on the QB inside of Garrett.\n\nOne of his weaknesses pointed out by every scout is his size and he already added 10 lbs of muscle to his playing weight of 280 at Ohio State. We like that his frame allows room for more muscle mass. His performance was one of the most dominant at the Senior Bowl, consistently pushing lineman into the backfield and constantly turning heads from all the coaches and scouts. Lastly, the fact that he doesn't turn 21 until a couple months after the draft doesn't hurt his status.\"\n\nThe selection and write-up were made by yman1020:\n\n\"We need a starting linebacker. Devin Bush is garbage and needs to be a veteran locker presence not a starter on this defense.\n\nThe Browns have had some success in the mid rounds over the last few years and hopefully that trend continues. I do find it hard to believe that they would draft a defensive tackle in the second round. They already have Tomlinson, Harris, Jefferson, Hurst, and Ika. Zadarius Smith will also kick inside on some third downs, so I don't see how they have a need or the roster space for a sixth defensive tackle. My belief is if one of the wide receivers or offensive tackles falls, they would consider drafting them for the simple fact of positional value and depth in this draft. Someone like Keon Coleman, Xavier Leggette, Troy Franklin or Jalynn Polk may be there and those guys are all borderline first round talents. I believe you should always draft BPA in the first three rounds no matter what. The order of need in my opinion is as follows: LB, TE, OT, RB, OG, DB.\n\nRight now, we have young talent at running back. Neither Ford nor Strong is a world beater, but they create a two-headed committee between the 10's and D'Onta Foreman can come in for goal line. That should be very serviceable until Chubb can make it back and show us if there is anything left in his knee. Brooks (ACL injury) would be an interesting pick if he could be drafted and then placed on IR for his rookie year. He's a first round talent and we could stash him as a great Chubb insurance policy for 2025 and beyond. I think if Sinnott at tight end or Edgerrin Cooper at linebacker are there in the second round, they would also be under heavy consideration.\n\nI think this will be Bitonio's last season. It felt like his play was starting to fall off last year and if one of the top two guards are their that may also be an option.\n\nUltimately, in this case, the Browns get Junior Colson in the third round, a player who can bring maximum force next to JOK's speed and coverage. We need some real depth and a farm system mentality to all position groups. The linebacking core needs more long term potential and so the Browns look to the north and get their man.\"\n\nThank you to everyone who took part in the 2024 DBN Community Mock Draft!", "source": {"uri": "dawgsbynature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawgs By Nature"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_pokorny@dawgsbynature.com", "name": "Chris Pokorny", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dean_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Dean Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Bush_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Bush Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Colson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junior Colson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keon_Coleman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keon Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Onta_Foreman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D'Onta Foreman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxFlQMx4sbESoMU-jf9Idoq-WZ8=/0x264:3099x1814/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25412036/1763955323.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

A key team exec weighs in", "body": "GARFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio -- Will the Browns trade into their pickless fourth round of the NFL Draft on Saturday? The last pick in the trade for Deshaun Watson, which also includes the third and final first-round pick this year?\n\nIf they don't pick up a fourth by trading up or back, they'll have a big gap in the draft, from No. 85 in the third round to No. 156 in the fifth. Their first pick is No. 54 in the second round.\n\nWith some draft experts believing that the draft drops off considerably about midway through the fourth round, it wouldn't be surprising for the Browns to try to climb back into that space and make the early part of Day 3 a lot more interesting.\n\n\"Just generally it's never a bad thing to have more picks than not so, we're active, we're going to work the phones we're going to make sure we're aware of what the possibilities are out there and then I'm sure (GM) Andrew (Berry) has some thoughts in mind,\" Glenn Cook, Browns assistant GM, told cleveland.com at a Browns Stay in the Game! school attendance event at Elmwood Elementary. \"If we need to strike, we'll strike and if not, we're also comfortable using the picks we have, and potentially using less. I think everything's on the table with us so, we'll see. We'll see come Thursday through Saturday.\"\n\nLikewise, will the Browns use both of their seventh-round picks on Saturday afternoon, their own No. 243, and the No. 227 from trading reserve offensive tackle Leroy Watson two weeks ago to the Titans? Berry is known for unloading his seventh-rounders.\n\n\"We'll see,\" Cook said with a smile. \"It's fun to have an opportunity from the first pick to the last pick to potentially draft a player who comes in and maybe outproduces what people thought, and he's much better than we thought he was. So we'll never treat any of our picks as less valuable than the others. We'll view them all as important and make sure we make the right choices.\"\n\nThe Browns' personnel department is getting used to being all dressed up with nowhere to go on Thursday night of the draft, with no first-round pick for the third straight year.\n\n\"We have experience with it,\" Cook said. \"But we feel well-positioned, especially in this draft to do what we need to do to make sure our roster is as strong as possible. We understand it's a really strong division. Probably the best one in the league and obviously our conference is extremely competitive. So we know we have work to do, but we feel well-positioned through all the work we've done with our scouts and staff.\n\n\"Even onboarding the new coaching staff and looping in their thoughts and perspectives on our roster, it's been really good to kind of work through it throughout the spring and now we're just ready to kind of execute.\"\n\nCook acknowledged that moves made in free agency and trades, such as acquiring receiver Jerry Jeudy from the Broncos for a fifth and sixth-round pick, don't necessarily inform what they'll do with their top two selections. They try to approach the draft like they're an expansion team, with a \"best available player\" mentality.\n\n\"We understand how competitive the division is, how deep you need to be in this league in terms of the attrition that happens, so we'll do what's best for the roster,\" he said. \"We try to maximize the resources we do have. So we don't know what that means, quite honestly. We'll see.\"\n\nWith the Browns well-stocked at most positions, they won't be forced to draft for need anywhere on the depth chart.\n\n\"I don't want to speak for Andrew, but we try to position ourselves to maintain optionality in all of our decisions,\" Cook said. \"We'll give ourselves a chance to do what's best and maximize the particular choices we have and not feel restricted by a particular need or desire. We're going to go in with our minds wide open and make sure we're doing the right thing for our squad for the long term and keeping the mid term in mind.\"\n\nHe said the strength of the draft at various positions is a subjective thing, and varies from team to team.\n\n\"We think it's a pretty good draft,\" he said. \"We've worked through as many simulations as we could at this pick that we're sitting at so we feel good about what we'll be looking at and some of our opportunities to acquire talent in that spot.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that \"the hay's never in the barn. We're always working through every possibility. It's a year-round job. Every day, we're tweaking and messing with different possibilities roster-wise whether it's the draft whether it's trade opportunities, or whether it's signings for guys, we're not on team right now. So we're always working. Hopefully our fans have seen us put that into action, that we're constantly trying to make this roster the best we can.\"\n\nCook took a break from participating in football skills and drills with the school children, one of the Browns' gym class takeovers that rewards kids for good attendance, to conduct the brief interview. Berry hosted the entire personnel department at the event the day before the draft, same as last year.\n\nThe Browns' Stay in the Game! Attendance Network supports more than 250,000 students and 57 school districts, and continues to grow. Renee Harvey, vice president and executive director of the Cleveland Browns Foundation, said more than 100 school districts in Ohio will be involved next school year, and many other states have reached out to adopt the program. Attendance numbers have increased dramatically in districts where it's in place.\n\n\"We understand we have a huge responsibility to put a great team on the field, and to provide a lot of excitement on the field for this community,\" Cook said. \"But I think it's also important to remember we're committed to making an impact off the field. So this is just one of the ways you can do it, coming into a school like this where the kids have kind of pushed through and finished up testing today and now have an opportunity to provide some fun for them. That's just as important for us in the organization as honestly, what we do on the field on Sundays and in our work every day.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (hull)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_Heights,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garfield Heights, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Garfield Heights, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expansion team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/4AMF3WRL6JB75O4BTU3MRKGNBU.jpg?auth=cb586633fb3d485d5b71f6b020a9b54a7c0af1cf1d87a800be325175258f6cd4&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Garfield Heights, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

This week they turn their attention toward the NFL Draft.\n\nCleveland enters the week with six picks at the moment, but general manager Andrew Berry is always open for business during draft weekend looking to move up and down the board. He will put some final touches on the Browns roster later this week.\n\nHere are four burning Bronws questions:\n\nBerry didn't give a lot away in his pre-draft presser last week - he rarely does. But reading between the lines I think we can rule out a trade up into the first round. That would take a lot to pull off and Berry seemed pretty reserved to the idea that they'll really start strategizing after Thursday night and then get a better idea of what they're able to do 10 picks out. With all that in mind, plus the fact that the Browns haven't made a pick before the third round since 2021, I think they will stay put and draft a player at 54.\n\nThat doesn't mean they won't make any moves up and down the board on draft weekend. I think there's a chance their pick at 85 falls into a spot where they have a number of players they like available and potentially move back. I also don't necessarily think they use all the picks they have right now. Or maybe it's just wishful thinking so I don't have to wait with bated breath to write about pick 243.\n\nAs things stand right now, and it's only April 22, I think Jerome Ford is still the lead back of the group, I think free agent addition D'Onta Foreman is next, followed by fellow free agent signee, Nyheim Hines and then Pierre Strong and John Kelly Jr., who is basically a camp body.\n\nNow what's interesting about the timing of this question is that Cleveland's running back situation is a very fluid one right now. The Browns have shown some interest in the running back prospects in this year's draft class. That's not for nothing. And if they do draft a running back later this week the math changes on this entirely. Ford may have some competition for the primary backup job once Chubb returns if they do add a rookie.\n\nLike the running back room, the draft could obviously change some things. Berry has drafted a defensive back in every single draft he's overseen since coming to Cleveland in 2020. If Berry hits on a corner that really shines in training camp and the preseason then of course there's a chance Newsome becomes a trade asset for the Browns.\n\nFor now though, I think the Newsome trade rumors are very much dead. Berry made a great point in his presser last week. With how much nickle Cleveland and much of the league plays these days, having good coverage corners is invaluable. Berry flat out said \"that's not a skillset that I'm looking to give away.\" Plan on Cleveland picking up Newsome's fifth-year option next Wednesday and for him to be part of this roster in 2024.\n\nWatson did seem to create more confusion than clarity on the shoulder last week in regards to when the injury happened and when he'll be back. After declaring a couple weeks back that he'll be ready for Week 1, he also said last week that no one really knows when he'll be 100%.

Everything has to be on the table, because it's too hard to gauge exactly what might happen in the 53 picks before.\n\nThat being said, here's a final round of names analysts had available for the Browns:\n\nNFL.com's Chad Reuter stays with Cooper in this pick, who he had coming to Cleveland in his last multi-round mock as well.\n\nIn 2023, Cooper was a first-team AP All-American and first-team All-SEC selection. He led the team with 84 tackles, 17 TFL, 8.0 sacks, tied for team lead with two forced fumbles, and also had two pass breakups.\n\n\"Highly physical linebacker with elite top-end speed and a burning desire to get to the football that can lead to some inconsistencies in his play,\" writes NFL analyst Lance Zierlein. \"Cooper is average at diagnosing the run but takes off around traffic on a mission to find the ball-carrier once he sees it. He can be undisciplined playing his run fits and takes unorthodox paths downhill, but he somehow finds ways to slither around blocks and make challenging tackles.\"\n\nIf there's one thing the Browns love, it's drafting DBs.\n\nThe Bleacher Report Scouting Department has them pegged with adding to one of their most obvious strengths.\n\nIn 2023, Lassiter earned second-team All-SEC honors for the Bulldogs. He started all 14 games and led the team with 8 pass breakups.\n\nCBS Sports' Ryan Wilson has the Browns adding some more depth to their interior line. On a team that doesn't have a ton of \"needs\" necessarily, the interior line is certainly one of them after Jordan Elliott departed in free agency.\n\n\"This Browns defense was dominant for much of last season and Hall is a twitched-up terror who was consistently disruptive for the Buckeyes a year ago,\" Wilson writes. \"He only weighed 290 at the combine, but that's in the same range as Shelby Harris and Maurice Hurst.\"\n\nHall had a pretty good Senior Bowl showing, and ended the 2023 season with third-team All-Big Ten accolades. In 12 games, he had 24 tackles, two tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks.\n\nIn Pro Football Focus' seven-round mock, they have the Browns trading out of the second round, sending the Atlanta Falcons pick No. 54 and receiving Pick No. 74 and a 2025 third-round pick. This is a strategy we have seen Andrew Berry deploy before, but trading will depend on how much they like the value in the second round.\n\nIf they trade down, PFF likes them adding to their O-line for more depth and the future.\n\n\"Browns add a potential future replacement for Jedrick Wills Jr.,\" their analysis says. \"Fisher would need to adjust from right tackle to the left side but can learn and develop. He already has the power to play in the NFL but will need to become a more polished pass protector.\"\n\nTaking a tackle for Cleveland would be interesting, as they currently have three starting-caliber players on their roster in Wills, Dawand Jones and Jack Conklin. All three suffered season-ending injuries in 2023, and are working their way back.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football All-America Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mock draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Zierlein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lance Zierlein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawand_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dawand Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedrick_Wills", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jedrick Wills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Conklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Conklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelby Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/VEVRENKHR5AOVGZAJ7J3GCWSAY.jpg?auth=fe62c1441e09cb70f12e7c8abaa154e0918084b4ccf91ffe3ece9362be1ef208&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

For the city of Cleveland and the Cleveland Browns, that connection is much deeper. The Browns were once stolen from the great fanbase and the people of Cleveland and the fans of the Browns made sure the name, colors and records remained in Northeast Ohio.\n\nUnfortunately, sports are also big business, especially the NFL.\n\nThe conversations about Cleveland Browns Stadium have gone all over the place in the last year or so:\n\nWe sought feedback from Browns fans on whether they wanted a dome or open-air stadium while Curtiss Brown provided his opinion on the matter.\n\nBesides the where (on Lake Erie or in the suburb) and what (dome or open air), the biggest question is around how. How will the stadium get paid for?\n\nConstruction costs have skyrocketed over the last couple of years which has seen a huge jump in stadium prices. A look at many of the most expensive stadiums in the league:\n\nThe jump from Lucas Oil to U.S. Bank is big but SoFi Stadium out in Los Angeles puts all of that into perspective. The question was whether or not the LA venture would be the outlier or where things are headed. The question \"was\" because the Chicago Bears proposal tells us that SoFi's cost is likely to be the new normal:\n\nThe Chicago Bears are set to announce a $4.6 billion plan to build a new enclosed stadium and improved lakefront area with half of the money coming from taxpayers, sources said.\n\nFor those focused on the finances, the proposal focuses on keeping the current 2% hotel tax to help the public side of the funding. The issue is that they still owe a huge amount because that tax hasn't been enough:\n\nThe 2% hotel tax has fallen far short of paying off the existing debt. As a result, taxpayers still owe $629 million for past renovations of Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, whose occupants, the White Sox, also are seeking a new stadium in the South Loop.\n\nIn the end, something will get worked out for both the Browns and the Bears. Likely, both ownership groups will get a version of what they want but the citizens paying attention to the money are appropriately upset. The public still owes over $600 million for renovations on stadiums that soon could be empty or demolished. Now, the Bears want another $2-plus billion more.\n\nCleveland and the Browns are tied together in ways that almost no city and sports team is. The team will likely remain in Northeast Ohio. Will remain the \"Cleveland Browns\" and will, likely, be in a brand new stadium. The public will likely be on the hook for a large portion of that new stadium.\n\nHow does the Bears proposal impact your thoughts on what the Browns might do?

The veteran offensive lineman has appeared in 102 games (83 starts) across his seven-year NFL career, with his most recent in-game action coming back in 2022. Ifedi spent part of his 2023 campaign with the Browns' practice squad, and he's now expected to compete for a depth role on the team's offensive line as the offseason progresses.\n\nBrowns general manager Andrew Berry said Thursday that Watson (shoulder) has been making throws of up to 40 yards, Mary Kay Cabot of The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports. While not quite willing to guarantee that Watson will be ready for the regular-season opener, Berry did confirm that's the expectation and said the Browns are \"pretty optimistic\" about the QB's rehab process so far. Watson spoke with reporters Tuesday, mentioning that the team medical staff favors a cautious approach that would see him wait until training camp before returning to full practice participation. The 28-year-old thus figures to be limited during OTAs, giving free-agent additions Jameis Winston and Tyler Huntley more chances to throw to the team's top receivers. The Browns traded for WR Jerry Jeudy in March and still have WRs Amari Cooper and Elijah Moore as well as TE David Njoku. There's also a strong chance of improved blocking this season, after 2023 saw the Browns lose their top three OTs to season-ending knee injuries. Watson is the biggest variable though, perhaps more so because of his disappointing 2022-23 performance than the ongoing rehab from Nov. 21 surgery to repair a displaced glenoid fracture in his right shoulder.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Huntley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Huntley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/themes/heavy/assets/images/icons/heavy/android-chrome-36x36.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-21", "textStart": 1525, "textEnd": 1532}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Cleveland's first pick comes in the second round at No. 54 overall. The Browns don't have a dire need they have to address with that pick, so the team could decide to go in many different directions depending on how things play out.\n\nBrowns insider Tony Grossi of ESPN Cleveland believes that Chubb may be done if the team selects a running back with their first pick.\n\n\"For one thing, the team's offense is totally different now from when Nick joined the team. It's going away from the running game,\" Grossi said during an ESPN Cleveland radio appearance on April 24. \"If they [draft a running back at No. 54], I would conclude they have no hope of Nick Chubb playing again.\"\n\nAll the Browns' statements have indicated otherwise. The team has remained adamant that Chubb will play at some point next season, although an exact timeline for his return remains uncertain. Chubb is still on the road to recovery following a devastating knee injury he suffered in September of 2023.\n\nChubb and the Browns agreed to a restructured contract this offseason. The move chopped down Chubb's base salary of around $12 million and converted much of that into incentives. It lowered Chubb's cap hit to a manageable $6.275 million.\n\n\"Yeah, I won't comment in detail on the contract, other than to say that I think that whenever you go through a situation like that, I think people think it's easy for a club, an agent, to be adversarial,\" Browns GM Andrew Berry said on April 18. \"And, you know, with Nick's situation, I really applaud Nick and then his reps, Todd France and A.J. Stevens, for being really collaborative partners and finding a solution that worked for everybody.\n\n\"You know, I think everybody in this room is happy that Nick is back as a Cleveland Brown and we're very optimistic that he's going to crush the rehab.\"\n\nThe Browns are anticipating Chubb's return but aren't putting all their eggs into him carrying the load either. Cleveland returns Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong Jr. from last year's squad.\n\nFord took on the lead back role last season with Chubb sidelined. He finished the season with 813 rushing yards and 4 touchdowns, averaging 4.0 yards per carry.\n\nThe Browns also added some veteran depth this offseason, bringing in D'Onta Foreman and Nyheim Hines. Foreman is expected to play the Kareem Hunt-type role, while Hines is more known for his pass-catching and kick-return abilities.\n\n\"Depth is important at every position, we were really pleased with that room last year,\" Berry said. \"I thought Jerome and Pierre in particular, you know, did an incredible job filling in last year, and then obviously we had Kareem (Hunt) in those high leverage and short yardage moments. But Jerome and Pierre, they got obviously a lot of time and a lot of reps last year and feel very good about their skillset. We've added a couple of guys to that room with differing skill sets that can complement those guys, but we think we're in a pretty strong spot.\"\n\nAdding a healthy Chubb to the mix would only strengthen that unit. The four-time Pro Bowler has rushed for 6,511 yards and 48 touchdowns over 77 games.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Ford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Onta_Foreman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D'Onta Foreman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyheim_Hines", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nyheim Hines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1672226015-2-e1714032606547.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "dateEnd": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 221, "textEnd": 232}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 793, "textEnd": 801}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 1690, "textEnd": 1698}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

There have certainly been trends -- age matters in many cases and trading down is always on the table -- but it hasn't been easy to put Berry in a box.\n\nThis is the final draft with no first-round picks as a result of the Deshaun Watson trade and Berry has kept the roster afloat. The biggest question mark, ironically, might be quarterback.\n\nThe Browns don't go on the clock until Friday night, but they'll be active once their turn gets close. Here are three predictions for this weekend.\n\nBerry has traded up before and it was in a similar spot to where the Browns are in this draft. In 2021, Berry moved from No. 59 to No. 52 to select linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah. Along with No. 59, he swapped the No. 89 pick for the No. 113 pick, moving from the end of the third to the beginning of the fourth.\n\n\"In reality, you probably get a more narrow focus maybe 10 -- call it 10 picks out,\" Berry said in his pre-draft press conference last week, \"because that's when really players become, I guess, more in striking distance.\"\n\nIt all will depend on how the draft shakes out once the Browns get within striking distance, but it wouldn't be a surprise if Berry manufactured a deal similar to the trade up he used to get Owusu-Koramoah. The Browns had two third-round picks to utilize then, but if the right player is there, it might be worth trading out of Saturday night if needed, especially considering they don't have a fourth-round pick and would probably like one, even if it came at the expense of No. 85.\n\nIf we were placing odds, a trade down would be the favorite, but the template exists for a small move up. Don't bet against it.\n\nBerry tends to not leave many needs for the draft to fill, especially when he hasn't had a first-round pick. One example was in 2020 when they didn't address left tackle prior to the draft and selected Jedrick Wills Jr. at No. 10.\n\nA glance at the current roster doesn't show many glaring needs -- they could use another linebacker, perhaps, and some more depth at defensive tackle, but for the most part the top of the roster is in good shape.\n\nWhen you dig in behind David Njoku at tight end, there might be an opportunity for a young player. Right now it's Jordan Akins, Giovanni Ricci and Zaire Mitchell-Paden. The departure of Harrison Bryant left TE2 open for competition.\n\nThe Browns selected Bryant to start Day 3 in 2020 and if they manage to land a fourth-round pick somehow, a tight end could be in consideration.\n\nBerry recently acquired a second seventh-round pick and while those haven't always been picks he's kept, you only have to go back two years to find a draft where he made two seventh-round picks.\n\n\"It's a trade that we thought could give us a resource that we could use effectively,\" Berry said last week of adding a seventh. \"How we deploy that resource remains to be seen. It could be we could select players with those two picks. It could be part of a move up.\"\n\nThe bottom of the roster became a little more important when the NFL changed the kickoff rule for this season. More returns means more players who need to be able to cover kicks and do it in a different way.\n\n\"I think the body type for kickoff coverage players is going to potentially change pretty significantly,\" Berry said. \"Because you're taking a lot of speed and space out of the traditional play. I think you're going to probably see bigger body types, guys that are really good with their hands and that can, I would say, traditionally get off blocks as opposed to maybe use their speed and quickness to avoid a block just because of the setup rules.\"\n\nLate draft picks and undrafted free agents have to thrive on special teams to make it in the league and Berry could find value in using at least one of those seventh-rounders on a player who could start out contributing in a big way on Bubba Ventrone's coverage units.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Owusu-Koramoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedrick_Wills", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jedrick Wills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Ricci_(bishop)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Ricci (bishop)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Akins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Akins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Pick_Two", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Pick Two", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/GLVVIRRAMZB3LPI52C4DQODA5U.JPG?auth=c408e38ad690cb97166d46d7f9ea208645abf48715d96052dfb65e4cfb3b2526&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The 31-year-old former Pro Bowler has been working hard this offseason in hopes of landing another shot in the NFL.\n\nLandry put out a video on social media showing his training with the simple caption: \"Rent due.\"\n\nThe video shows Landry training, running routes and catching balls. It closes with the word, \"ready.\"\n\nLandry most recently played for his hometown Saints during the 2022 season. But he appeared in just nine games. Hampered by injuries, Landry caught just 25 passes for 272 yards and one touchdown. New Orleans chose not to bring him back.\n\nIn his prime, Landry was a catch machine. He reeled off five consecutive Pro Bowls from 2015 to 2019 with the Miami Dolphins and Browns. Landry has 713 career catches for 7,870 yards and 38 touchdowns.\n\nLandry was integral to the Browns' turnaround into a playoff contender during his stay in Cleveland from 2018-21. Thanks to his outspoken leadership and production on the field, he became a fan favorite.\n\nHowever, the Browns were forced to make a tough decision in 2022. Landry was coming off an injury and the Browns wanted to go in a different direction. Shortly after acquiring Amari Cooper via a trade with the Dallas Cowboys, the Browns released Landry.\n\nHe recently disputed that he wanted to leave Cleveland and said that he attempted to stick around with a restructured deal.\n\n\"I asked to restructure and I was told 'hold up' then next thing you know another WR was signed and I got my walking papers,\" Landry wrote.\n\nLandry also hinted at some unrest in Cleveland regarding personnel decisions. One notable departure was Odell Beckham Jr., a good friend of Landry's.\n\n\"I stayed quite in CLE because I didn't like what was going on and I was hoping for a better resolution,\" Landry said. \"We had a team that was one play away from playing for the AFC championship, and having the team we started with together would have played a big role in it [a]nd I saw that bigger picture.\"\n\nThe Browns' wide receiver room looks much different than it did when Landry was around. Cooper was the first big change but the Browns have done some work via trades since to bolster their depth.\n\nCleveland landed Elijah Moore prior to last season in a trade with the New York Jets. Moore didn't wow in his first season with the Browns but showed some potential as a playmakers. Having Deshaun Watson around for a full 17-game slate would help his cause.\n\nThe Browns added former first-round pick Jerry Jeudy this offseason. The team snagged him in a trade with the Denver Broncos. Cleveland gave up fifth and sixth round picks in the deal.\n\nJeudy hasn't yet lived up to his potential but the Browns are banking that he'll come around.

Mandatory Credit: Scott Galvin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLike any other NFL draft prospect waiting with bated breath to hear their phone ring, David Njoku was a bundle of nerves on the fateful day of his drafting. While waiting for the phone to ring, Njoku received an unexpected call and was less than pleased with the person on the other side.\n\nNjoku was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the first round of the 2017 draft. Talking about the day he finally made his first steps into the big league, the tight end revealed that he had actually been in the house of his mentor, watching the draft in the theatre room and waiting for his own call to come.\n\nHowever, when a call did come, it was not the one he wanted. He revealed that one of his friends called him to inquire about the after-party and got an earful from Njoku. He said,\n\n\"Obviously, I'm sweating bullets, sh*tting bricks. The phone that I had for the call was on the table, and it started ringing. And there was a number I didn't know so I'm like oh cr*p I'm about to get drafted. I answer it and its my homie talking about the after party for after when I get drafted and I was like 'bro I should kill you right now! Don't call me again'\"\n\nSoon after though, Njoku got the call he had actually been waiting for as Cleveland inducted him into the Browns camp, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nSince his draft day in 2017, David Njoku has come a long way, becoming the first Browns tight end to make a Pro Bowl last year, since Gary Barnidge in 2014. The tight end went through some pretty serious growth last season after he suffered severe burns on his body due to a barbeque party gone wrong.\n\nHe was back on the field just two days after the accident, raking up 81 total catches for 882 yards and six touchdowns. Not only that, but Njoku's 81 catches led the Browns last season, being the fifth-most by a Browns TE in a season. The Browns managed to nab themselves a playoff berth too last season, with the TE's six receiving touchdowns leading the team.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Barnidge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Barnidge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/12/5c5898b5-untitled-design-2023-12-22t121233.198.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-12-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Andrew Berry has shown that he's not opposed to moving around in the draft based on his overall value of each selection.\n\nFor this exercise, we will act as though the Browns are staying at these two draft slots and diving into some of the players that ESPN predicts to be there.\n\n(The % amount is the chance that each player will likely be available, not the % chance that they'll be the Browns' selection).\n\nSanders would be an interesting pick at 54, but one that could make sense for the team in terms of some of the things that they want to do on offense in 2024. He could be used in a lot of the same ways that Cleveland uses David Njoku, and having two incredibly versatile tight ends is never a bad thing.\n\nWR Malachi Corley\n\nCorley is the definition of a \"weapon\" when describing a receiver and what they can do for an offense. His 9.74 YAC average was 1st in college football in 2023 and he's the type of player that could be deadly with manufactured touches at the next level. He would give the Browns a dangerous playmaker on screens and short-to-intermediate routes from the slot.\n\nWR Roman Wilson\n\nWilson was the main talking point of this year's Reese's Senior Bowl due to his ability to separate and outrun opposing defensive backs. He undoubtedly has the elite speed and athleticism that Cleveland's been looking for at wide receiver.\n\nWR Troy Franklin\n\nFranklin is a surprisingly polished wideout with the speed and technique to contribute right away on the outside. His consistent ability to outrun and stack defensive backs is what stands out on film. He was 1st in EPA per route run amongst all collegiate wide receivers in 2023 and would give the Browns an explosive playmaker opposite Amari Cooper in 2024.\n\nOT Kingsley Suamataia\n\nSuamataia is a very intriguing player based on his combination of size and athleticism but he could benefit from sitting out a year to refine his mechanics. Cleveland might be an ideal spot for him to land in respect to his development and ability to contribute for the team in year 2.\n\nTrotter Jr. is an instinctive and savvy linebacker with NFL bloodlines who has been incredibly productive in college. His ability to fit the run without error and consistently stay under control at the point of attack could attract defensive coordinators like Jim Schwartz in this range.\n\nT/G Brandon Coleman\n\nColeman has produced great film at both left tackle and guard while at TCU, with his movement skills being his most sought-after trait. He could be appealing to Cleveland due to his overall success and positional versatility at the next level. Coleman could develop into a starter down the line at either offensive guard or tackle if he works on his technical deficiencies.\n\nOT Kiran Amegadjie\n\nAmegadjie burst onto the scenes in the Ivy League due to his overwhelming length and movement skills. He's consistently dominated at the collegiate level against inferior competition, but a lot of his traits should transition nicely over to the NFL. He's another player who could have a future at either guard or tackle in Cleveland.\n\nOT Blake Fisher\n\nFisher is an athletic, technically efficient lineman who has the tools and ability to play both left and right tackle in the NFL. He needs to work on being more consistent in pass pro but a lot of those mechanics can be easily fixed with coaching. The Browns might see Fisher as a potential replacement at one of the offensive tackle spots down the road.\n\nRB Jaylen Wright\n\nWright has been rising up draft boards as of late due to his speed, strength, and contact balance. His ability to create big plays on the ground and potential to be a fit in multiple schemes as both a runner and pass-catcher could attract teams like Cleveland in the picks 80-100 range.", "source": {"uri": "dawgsbynature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawgs By Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Franklin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Schwartz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Schwartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU_Horned_Frogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TCU Horned Frogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d5QoeFIW_tHKch7yXQBQ0vVlwa4=/0x0:5604x2802/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25415712/2147911465.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The event will be held today-Sunday in Detroit.\n\nThe Browns are coming off an 11-6 season in which they earned an AFC playoff berth.\n\n\"I think everyone's excited about what we have going on in Cleveland,\" Walch said.\n\nWalch is starting his second season as the director of player development with the Browns. He works mostly with young skill-position players: Quarterbacks, wide receivers, tight ends and running backs in their first or second years in the league.\n\n\"Between that group, you're typically going to have a couple of guys who come out in the draft,\" Walch said. \"But we still have guys from last year that I'll be working with this year.\"\n\nPrior to the draft, each NFL team can bring 30 players into their facility for thorough interviews. Walch is part of that process, but he is not asked to evaluate players that the Browns may select.\n\n\"During that time, I had the opportunity to sit down with each one of those players for about 10 minutes and ask general questions,\" he said.\n\nThe Browns have just five picks in this year's draft. They are without a pick in the first and fourth rounds in the seven-round event. But Walch notes the team still puts a lot of work into the process and the excitement level is high.\n\n\"I don't think that changes anything just because there's so many great players through the second, third and fourth round,\" he said. \"There's a lot of talent throughout (the draft), it's just finding the right fit for your organization.\"\n\nThe Browns did trade two lower round picks for veteran wide receiver Jerry Jeudy.\n\n\"He's a proven starter in the NFL,\" Walch said. \"When you can add that to your wide receiver room, that just adds depth to the unit.\"\n\nWalch does not sit in personnel meetings so he is unsure what positions or players the Browns might be targeting in the draft.\n\n\"I think people always go in with areas they want to improve,\" he said. \"But I think at the end of the day, they always kind of hone in on who's the best player or you can bring the most value at that time in the draft.\"\n\nThe 46-year-old Walch is not part of the Browns on-site draft room and he will remain in Cleveland during the draft. He plans to monitor the event with other team coaches and staff members at the Browns' training facility.\n\nWalch did a lot of traveling in the offseason, including taking his parents on a trip to Jamaica in March after spending time back home in Eglin in February.\n\n\"They really enjoyed it,\" he said. \"It was nice to get on the beach and get some sun and show them a different part of the world that they had never been to.\"\n\nHe returned to Cleveland a few weeks ago as the Browns began meetings and strength and conditioning with players. Next week, following the draft, the players will also be allowed on the field with coaches, but not for competitive practices.\n\nStarting June 11, the Browns will hold three-day organized team activities including a mandatory min-camp.\n\n\"Right now we're getting in the OTA phase where we'll be out in the grass and get to work with the players a little bit more which is always exciting,\" Walch said. \"...

Among the groups who pose questions is running back. But if they did add to the running back room, recent drafts show they've faired well.\n\nHere's how the running backs they've drafted since 2018 have performed.\n\nThis obviously starts with the Browns taking Nick Chubb early in the second round in 2018 (35th overall). Chubb has been nothing short of spectacular and became a fan favorite, racking up for Pro Bowl selections and a second-team All-Pro nod.\n\nHe currently ranks fourth in franchise history in rushing yards (6,511) and if Chubb comes back strong from his season-ending torn MCL injury, he'll climb further up that list.\n\nThe Browns wouldn't draft another back until taking Demetric Felton Jr. in 2021 in the sixth round (211th overall). Felton only totaled eight carries for 20 yards (2.5 per carry), seeing more touches at receiver with 20 catches.\n\nThe last running back Cleveland has drafted since is Jerome Ford in 2022 in the fifth round (156th overall). He finished third in kickoff return yards in his rookie year (723).\n\nHis 2023 season watched him become the first-string back after Chubb's season-ending injury in Week 2, and finish with a solid 813 yards on 204 carries (4.0 per carry) and four touchdowns.\n\nCheck out the video at the top of this post to watch Sports 4 CLE host Dave Bacon and the Orange and Brown Report's Brad Ward discuss the draft capital the Browns have spent on running back compared to the rest of the NFL.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetric_Felton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demetric Felton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Ford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan statistical area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/VLETAVHCCBD2FDRY2TPGPTFSIM.JPG?auth=4bc32426f767ddedb149606a172f5e3e23891c4abc90deebc8af087426511260&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The 2024 NFL draft starts today, and while the Cleveland Browns do not have a first round pick, you better believe they have done their homework on Troy Franklin, T'Vondre Sweat, and other potential Day 2 targets.\n\nWith team needs along their offensive line, at wide receiver, defensive tackle, and linebacker, the Browns could go in a variety of directions on Friday night. While players like Florida State wide receiver Keon Coleman or BYU offensive tackle Kingsley Suamataia are ideal targets for the Browns to circle in Sharpie, there are also a plethora of players they should have a big red X next to.\n\nHere are five players the Browns must avoid when they come on the clock with pick No. 54, 85 or anywhere else throughout the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nWR Troy Franklin, Oregon\n\nOregon wide receiver Troy Franklin celebrates a touchdown as the No. 6 Oregon Ducks host the USC Trojans Saturday, Nov. 11, 2023, at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore.\n\nThere are way too many question marks about Oregon wide receiver for me to feel good about using a second round pick on him.\n\nI'm worried about his slender 174-pound frame. I'm worried about his ability to consistently track the football down the field. I'm worried about his potential to run a full route tree and not just stride it out on the vertical plane.\n\nCan he play through contact and beat press man coverage? Can he sink his hips and get in and out of breaks on routes that aren't just screens or verticals? Can his body hold up at the NFL level?\n\nHopefully that's not a question the Browns have to answer and someone drafts him earlier than pick No. 54.\n\nTE Ja'Tavion Sanders, Texas\n\nTexas Longhorns wide receiver Ja'Tavion Sanders (0) celebrates a catch for a first down during the Big 12 Championship game against the Oklahoma State Cowboys at AT&T stadium on Saturday, Dec. 2, 2023 in Arlington.\n\nFor starters, the guy cannot block worth a lick.\n\nThe calling card of Sanders was supposed to be his mismatch ability in the passing game and his athleticism. It turns out, however, that Sanders is not all that athletic either. While he runs a fast 40-yard dash, his explosiveness testing fell well below par, hitting just 30 inches in the vertical jump and 9-feet-6 in the broad jump.\n\nSanders overlaps and does not compliment the skillset of David Njoku at all. If we are being honest a good comparison for Sanders is Dollar Tree David Njoku (who has developed into one of the better blocking tight ends in the NFL).\n\nWhile the Browns need another tight end, and will probably look hard in the 2024 NFL draft for one, Sanders is not the one to go after.\n\nDL Brandon Dorlus, Oregon\n\nSep 17, 2022; Eugene, Oregon, USA; Oregon Ducks defensive end Brandon Dorlus (3) celebrates after a defensive stop against the Brigham Young Cougars at Autzen Stadium. Oregon won the game 41-20. Mandatory Credit: Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhat do you do with Brandon Dorlus along your defensive line?\n\nHe is too small to play three-tech but not athletic enough to win on the edge. He weighed in at just 283 pounds (21st percentile among all defensive tackles historically) and does not show the play strength on tape to two-gap, anchor doubles, or win with ease from the interior. However, if you run his testing numbers as a defensive end, Dorlus is just a 45th-percentile athlete there.\n\nA true tweener, Dorlus is a hard man to find a role for in an NFL defense. It's particularly hard to pinpoint a pathway to the field in Jim Schwartz's defensive scheme in Cleveland.\n\nLB Jeremiah Trotter Jr., Clemson\n\nSep 16, 2023; Clemson, South Carolina; Clemson linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Jr. (54) tackles Florida Atlantic running back Zuberi Mobley (2) the third quarter with Florida Atlantic at Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Ken Ruinard-USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nNepotism will take you a long way in the NFL, and Clemson linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Jr. has been a big beneficiary of it this year. Despite being undersized and unathletic, Trotter Jr. constantly gets mock drafted on Day 2 of these exercises.\n\nThen when looking at his tape, Trotter Jr.'s eyes are constantly in the wrong spot, forcing his teammates to correct. The Browns need a linebacker, but Trotter Jr. is not the one to go after. When grading Trotter, he is far closer to grading out as an undrafted free agent than he is as a Day 2 pick. However, he may be a benefactor from the sheer low number of players entering the draft this year.\n\nLet another team make that pick.\n\nDT T'Vondre Sweat, Texas\n\nFeb 29, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Texas defensive lineman T'Vondre Sweat (DL25) works out during the 2024 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter drafting Siaki Ika last year, another massive-bodied defensive tackle who did not fit the gap-shooting tasks that Schwartz asks of his defensive tackles, why would the Browns do that again this year with Texas defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat?\n\nNot to mention the murmurs that he played in 2023 around 390 pounds, the DWI two weeks before the draft, and is overall athleticism.\n\nIf the Browns look for another defensive tackle, which is a real possibility with two of the guys in their current room on one-year deals, they are better off going after guys who can shoot gaps and penetrate against the pass at a higher level. Ohio State's Michael Hall Jr. or LSU's Mekhi Wingo would be much better fits in Cleveland.", "source": {"uri": "brownswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Browns Wire"}, "authors":

Well, an exceptional cornerback is always welcome on every NFL club's roster.\n\nThis group's resident Pro Bowler is Denzel Ward. On the other side is M.J. Emerson who grabbed the starting outside corner gig in his rookie season and has Pro Bowl aspirations on his own. Also in the Browns defensive backfield is Greg Newsome, a former first-round draft pick. Last year, he either had a great year or a sub-par season depending on who you talk to.\n\nAlso on the roster is Cam Mitchell, a player that the coaching staff is very high on. Kahlef Hailassie was brought into the fold after the Kansas City Chiefs tried to slide him through waivers to which the Browns claimed him instead.\n\nThis off-season, there have been ripples that Cleveland would move Newsome who has been regulated to playing in the slot. If GM Andrew Berry did indeed trade Newsome, this group would need another player to fill his space. It appears the Browns will retain Newsome, but crazy things do happen on draft day.\n\nLet's take a good hard look at one prospect.\n\nMax Melton is an intriguing cornerback prospect because the slot might be his best role and could take Newsome's place. He does bring a lot of experience on the outside, though. Melton projects as a priority Day 3 pick with inside-outside versatility.\n\nMax Melton is a promising cornerback prospect with a versatile skill set that includes excellent coverage abilities, ball skills, and football intelligence. While he has areas to work on, such as press coverage, tackling technique, and penalty avoidance, his potential and athleticism make him a compelling option for teams in need of a cornerback. With proper coaching and continued development, Melton has the potential to become a successful NFL cornerback.", "source": {"uri": "dawgsbynature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawgs By Nature"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barry_shuck@dawgsbynature.com", "name": "Barry Shuck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Schwartz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Schwartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3WOM2uNv-RESatPPVzd_hOaRplA=/0x0:3099x1550/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25411322/1710649221.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504903", "eventUri": "eng-9504903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

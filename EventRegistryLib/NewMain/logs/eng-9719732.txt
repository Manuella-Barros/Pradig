The collection is only available on the 7Collection website.\n\n\"Slurpee Day is our annual celebration of 7-Eleven's birthday and our iconic frozen drink; it's a day of joy, community and good old-fashioned summer fun,\" Marissa Jarratt, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing & Sustainability Officer at 7-Eleven, said in a statement. \"We are thrilled to share the nostalgia and create new memories with Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and our customers who cherish this tradition so dearly.\"\n\nRewards members can also enter to win free drinks and snacks for a whole year.\n\nSlurpee Day began in 2002 and has grown in popularity since then.\n\nThe 7-Eleven brand is based in Texas and operates, franchises and licenses over 13,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada.

same question", "body": "7-ELEVEN customers have been notified about a one-time chance to get up to two Slurpees for free.\n\nThe deal comes as part of an annual tradition for the convenience store chain.\n\nEach year on July 11, given that July is the seventh month, 7-Eleven lets customers get a free Slurpee at any of its locations in the United States.\n\nThe date quickly became known as National Slurpee Day over the years.\n\nIn 2024, it'll be the chain's 97th birthday, and it's celebrating through the cost-free cold beverage on a hot summer's day, per USA Today.\n\nStill, fans have been asking the same question -- what size Slurpee can you get?\n\n7-Eleven has had different rules about the sizes and containers that could be used for Slurpee promotions.\n\nFor example, earlier this year, customers could head to any participating 7-Eleven, Speedway, or Stripes store for Slurpees with any container that met certain measurements as part of Bring Your Own Cup Day.\n\nThe convenience store chain required that the \"vessels\" customers used to get the Slurpee to be 10 inches or less in size.\n\n7-Eleven recommended obscure items that passed the test like motorcycle helmets, cowboy hats, fish bowls, milk cartons, and other items.\n\nThose who had qualifying containers paid only $1.99 for the Slurpee.\n\nFor the July 11 celebration, customers can only get a free small Slurpee at 7-Eleven, Speedway, or Stripes.\n\nAll they need to do is walk in, grab a small cup, and fill up on the day while supplies last.\n\nThe opportunity to get a second free small Slurpee is only available to 7Rewards or Speedy Rewards members.\n\nIt's free to sign up, and those who do can head to the App Store or Google Play Store and download either application.\n\nThey can then take the app into their local 7-Eleven or Speedway and scan it, where a coupon for another free small Slurpee will be available from July 12 to 31.\n\nRewards members also have the chance to win free Slurpees or snacks for an entire year simply by scanning the app or buying select items like Celsius energy drinks, Doritos, or Coca-Cola products.\n\n7-Eleven provides more information on the promotion on its website.\n\nThose who get the free Slurpees this year will even help a good cause.\n\nThe small cups were designed with Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, and customers can provide donations if they want to support the charity when they get their Slurpees this year.\n\nFans were concerned about the future of the free drinks in June after 7-Eleven confirmed the closures of at least 272 stores by the end of 2024.\n\nThe news came after a major change announcement in January that affected at least 3,000 7-Eleven locations nationwide.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com",

The event not only serves as a perfect escape from the summer heat but also marks a celebration of community and customer loyalty.\n\nAs the day approaches, Slurpee enthusiasts often plan their visit, eager to taste from the vast array of flavors available, ranging from classic favorites to new, exciting mixes, making it a festive summer highlight for many.\n\nNational Free Slurpee Day falls on July 11, a day eagerly anticipated by fans eager to indulge in a refreshing Slurpee from 7-Eleven, absolutely free.\n\nThe origins of the Slurpee date back to the late 1950s when Omar Knedlik, the inventor, stumbled upon the idea after his soda fountain broke, leading him to freeze sodas to keep them cool.\n\nThe resulting slushy soda became a hit, and Knedlik soon invented a machine to freeze carbonated drinks. By 1966, 7-Eleven had licensed the product, rebranded it as the Slurpee, and introduced it across its stores.\n\nThe celebration of Free Slurpee Day began in 2002 on July 11, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of 7-Eleven. The company decided to treat its customers to a free Slurpee, making it an annual event to show appreciation and foster customer loyalty.\n\nSince its inception, the Slurpee has evolved with over 300 flavors ranging from classics like Vanilla and 7-Elemon to sour tastes like Warhead and Sour Apple, and exotic varieties such as Mango and Lychee.\n\nThe Slurpee has not just been a treat but a cultural icon, complete with novelty and sometimes risqu\u00e9 flavor names like Pink Fink, Moonshine, Sticky Icky, Gully Washer, and Adults Only.\n\n7-Eleven, the world's largest convenience store chain, celebrated its 97th anniversary this year, marking a long journey from its humble beginnings as an ice house in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe company, originally known as the Southland Ice Company, was founded in 1927. In those days, customers could purchase blocks of ice for their iceboxes, along with milk, eggs, and bread. As the demand for ice dwindled with the advent of refrigerators, the company cleverly adapted its business model.\n\nIn 1946, the stores extended their hours from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., leading to the catchy new name, \"7-Eleven.\" This move revolutionized the retail industry, establishing the concept of the modern convenience store.\n\nBy the 1960s, 7-Eleven had expanded beyond Texas, becoming a national presence. It introduced innovative products like the Slurpee frozen drink in 1966, which quickly became a customer favorite. The company also pioneered self-serve soda fountains and the sale of gasoline at convenience stores.\n\nIn 1991, the Japanese company Ito-Yokado, which had been operating 7-Eleven stores in Japan under a licensing agreement, acquired a majority stake in the company. This led to the formation of Seven & i Holdings, which remains the parent company of 7-Eleven today.\n\n7-Eleven continued its global expansion throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, entering markets in Asia, Europe, and Australia. Today, it boasts over 80,000 stores in 19 countries, making it the largest convenience store chain in the world by store count.", "source": {"uri": "merca20.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Back then, convenience store chain was owned by the Dallas-based Southland Corporation, which had opened the first 7-Eleven in Oak Cliff.\n\nSo 7-Eleven was headquartered in Dallas when the Slurpee made its debut. Simple enough, right?\n\nSlurpee is 7-Eleven's brand, trademarked and all, but the actual invention of the icy, sugary treat traces back to 1950s Kansas and a Dairy Queen owner named Omar Knedlik.\n\nKnedlik, the story goes, had a broken soda fountain, so he put bottles of the soda in a freezer to cool them off. When he pulled them out frozen, he served the icy drinks, and they were a hit.\n\nKnedlik then came up with the idea for a machine that would produce the frozen drinks on demand, filing for a patent for the machine in 1958. The patent described the machine's product as a \"novel carbonated beverage...involving a liquid and frozen particles and capable of retaining a uniform concentration during melting of the frozen particles.\"\n\nKnedlik eventually came up with a shorter name for the drink: ICEE.\n\nYou can still find ICEEs all over the place, from Target stores to Burger Kings and gas stations. About 500 million ICEEs are sold every year, according to the company.\n\nBut while Omar Knedlik had the idea for the ICEE, he didn't build the machine on his own, and that's where Dallas came into play. Knedlik worked on the machine with Dallas-based manufacturer John E. Mitchell, completing it in 1965, according to Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nA 7-Eleven manager in Dallas soon picked up on the \"strange new product,\" according to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS). 7-Eleven then bought several ICEE machines and struck a licensing deal with ICEE to sell the slushy product under a different name.\n\n7-Eleven's name for its version of the ICEE was self-explanatory.\n\n\"The first time I heard that sound through a straw, it just came out 'slurp,'\" Bob Stanford, the director of 7-Eleven's in-house ad agency told NACS. \"We added the two e's to make a noun. It was just a fun name and we decided to go with it.\"\n\n7-Eleven made the most of that initial licensing deal with ICEE. The company recorded a not-quite-Grammy-worthy song about the Slurpee in the 1970s and dozens of commercials over the years. Oh, and you know that feeling you get when you drink a Slurpee too fast? They trademarked that, too.", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurpee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slurpee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Eleven", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "7-Eleven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Margarita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Knedlik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omar Knedlik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Icee_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Icee Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Cliff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oak Cliff"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_serve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft serve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex-Mex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tex-Mex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_fountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soda fountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Queen", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refrigerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Convenience_Stores", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Convenience Stores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smithsonian (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Dairy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Dairy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/e7a9d6b1-b68b-4e82-9233-9868ec034572/20240711T115035/e7a9d6b1-b68b-4e82-9233-9868ec034572_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719732", "eventUri": "eng-9719732", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The End \u2013 part 2 (60\u2019)Arno Schuitemaker 04/06, 20:30 | Rialto Theatre, Limassol The End \u2013 part 2 takes you to extremes. With an intriguing mix of movement, electronic music, light, and video, the performance explores a world of shifting relationships. What do togetherness, connection, and solidarity mean at this moment? What brings us closer to each other? How can mutual transparency strengthen interaction?The hyperphysical performances by choreographer Arno Schuitemaker always make an overwhelming impression and are praised for the inventive forms he creates with themes where the intimate and the universal meet. In an equally exciting and subtle way, The End \u2013 part 2 blurs the difference between seeing and being seen. The performance feels like a collection of short stories in which energy, stillness, sensitivity, distortion, and longing confront each other. The three performers expose different sides of themselves and, ultimately, lift physical boundaries\u2014even in opposition, our individual spaces can be shared.

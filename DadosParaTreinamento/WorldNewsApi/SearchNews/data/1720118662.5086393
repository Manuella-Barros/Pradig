Despite being second best for much of the contest at Wembley on Saturday night, Real eventually found a way through as Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Junior scored in the final 16 minutes to seal a 2-0 win. Real have now won eight more European Cups than the next side on the list \u2013 AC Milan with seven \u2013 and long-standing president Perez believes there is a special bond between club and competition. \u201cThis is a love story between Real Madrid and the European Cup,\u201d he told Movistar. \u201cSome people leave and others come, but this competition is very much ours. Everyone works very hard and we are very happy. \u201cIt\u2019s a magnificent night because this competition is the one we like the most. \u201cIt made us important on a global scale. Every time we win it there is satisfaction among the players, the president and all the fans around the world.\u201d Head coach Carlo Ancelotti also has a fine record in the Champions League, his five wins unrivalled by his peers. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018We\u2019ve done it again\u2019,\u201d added Perez. \u201cHe\u2019s won three European Cups with us and another two at other clubs. It\u2019s also his competition.\u201d Perez went on to confirm the club had tried to entice Toni Kroos to sign a new deal but that the Germany midfielder still intends to retire after a home Euros this summer. \u201cWe offered him a renewal, but it\u2019s clear in his mind that he wants to retire at the top of his game,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what Germans are like, it\u2019s very difficult to get them to change their minds! \u201cHe\u2019s done what he wanted to do, he\u2019s leaving as a legendary player and we will always remember him as one of the greatest midfielders in the world.\u201d Someone who will not be representing Germany in the summer is experienced Dortmund defender Mats Hummels. The 35-year-old has not made the cut but impressed for much of the final against Madrid on Saturday. \u201cWe put together some incredible attacks but didn\u2019t manage to put the ball in the net,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played a brilliant game, and I\u2019m proud of how we performed against a team where it feels like every single player has played in 28 Champions League finals, and we\u2019ve played in three. \u201cWe played with courage, with heart and with footballing class. We put together some incredible attacks but didn\u2019t manage to put the ball in the net. \u201cThen we made a couple of fairly small mistakes and Real struck like they always do. They had the kind of luck that we\u2019ve had in other games this Champions League season, but we didn\u2019t have it today. \u201cWe had four big chances \u2013 one of those has to go in. From the 70th minute onwards we gave away too many set-pieces, didn\u2019t keep possession for long enough and lost some of our composure.\u201d", "summary": "Real Madrid have eight more European Cups than nearest rivals AC Milan, with whom coach Carlo Ancelotti won two.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/carlo-ancelotti-florentino-perez-ac-milan-real-madrid-germans-b2555249.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/02/12/e5024019e250c14f499f137d873eea3dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3NDE0MTIy-2.76390419.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:05:01", "author": "Mark Mann-bryans", "authors": ["Mark Mann-bryans"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.336}

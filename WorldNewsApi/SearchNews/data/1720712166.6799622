Gomez started out working in corporate finance and banking, transitioning to marketing and then party promotion. She focused on business at El Dorado East Secondary School, then El Dorado Senior Comprehensive, moving on to do marketing and special event management at SBCS and Sital. \u201cI always loved the concept of creating things from scratch, or having someone just tell me an idea and then I get to actually build it. I enjoyed creating things people could come out and enjoy, creating things people like and want to support. \u201cI was the only female promoter 15 years ago having boat rides on Harbour Master and Treasure Queen. My best friend and I had this brand called Zero, so we used to have the Zero Breakfast Cruise, which was a Boxing Day cruise, and we had other events every Easter Monday. We threw land events down by Teteron. Back then we didn\u2019t call it brand marketing and personal branding and things like that, we just said we\u2019re throwing a party, we\u2019re having fun, but I realise that\u2019s what my passion was, that\u2019s what I really enjoyed.\u201d After a few years, Gomez said she began to think that she didn\u2019t want to be known only as a party girl. \u201cI asked myself, 'how can you use your skill, your expertise, your talents, interests, use the things you\u2019re passionate about to build your legacy?' I started to focus more on creating my agency, and working with other people on them having these same experiences, building their branding through events, through digital marketing, content marketing, things like that.\u201d Gomez said she was able to leverage the contacts she had made both in banking and while promoting when she launched her brand marketing agency, Avelle, in 2017. \u201cI was always passionate about connecting with people. That was just one of my superpowers. My clients would come in, connect with me, wait until I was free. I was always the person who was personable and wanted to connect with, and when I used to throw parties, I did the same thing. So when I transitioned I used the same connections to let them know I have this agency, this is what we do. \u201cFrom building my brand over the years, those people knew me and what I was capable of. That\u2019s another great benefit to building your name. Some people might see me as a promoter but others would say, 'well she did this for so many years, so clearly she could do it for me.' Or they would remember I have certain connections from having to work with radio stations, venues, other promoters.\u201d She said she had built a great network which enabled her to connect people. \u201cMy social media community gave me the name 'professional dot connector.' They said \u2018if we need anything we could definitely call Avalon. She would definitely know where to find it, she could get it done.\u2019 If they need to meet somebody, I am the person connecting those dots for them. So I said I had to put that on my website for sure.\u201d Gomez said one of her main challenges while opening her business was navigating life as a young mother. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the entertainment industry, you know how much time that takes from you, which was time away from my son. It was challenging being away from him all the time but thankfully my mother was very supportive, so he was never alone.\u201d She said another challenge was being a woman in the male-dominated event space. She said the men she worked with and around didn\u2019t think she deserved to be in the space and it should be theirs exclusively. \u201cEntertainment especially was male-dominated, and here was this girl doing her thing, earning her respect, but it definitely didn\u2019t come easy. It took me being very persistent, speaking up when I needed to, and making sure others knew I deserved to be here just as much.\u201d Gomez said a third challenge was building her business, including getting capital, finding consistent clients, and trying to show what made her different from anyone else. She said there have been many highs over the last few years, including working with Nadia Batson as part of her management team for the last seven years. \u201cIt\u2019s something I don\u2019t take for granted. Her entire journey and career have been a great asset to me and my career. \u201cAlso, being able to work with international clients is a high for me, because when people in New York or Miami or St Lucia are having an event attached to their brand or executing any type of launch, be it storefront, personal brand, or product, they think of me first. I get to work in different places.\u201d She said another high was getting to work with people every day, as she gets to meet amazing people. She said her online community were amazing cheerleaders. \u201cI get to share knowledge I\u2019ve learned over the years with different people and that\u2019s a big asset for me.\u201d Gomez is also the founder of EmpowHerTT, which she said came about from her challenges operating in a male-dominated space and becoming an entrepreneur. \u201cThe support wasn\u2019t there, even from other women. Covid19 was a period where a lot of people realised we need other people and women should support each other, things like community are very important. Prior to that, years before, it wasn\u2019t like that. Women would always be the first ones to bring down another woman, and I wanted EmpowHerTT to really fill that gap of supporting other female entrepreneurs who just started off their business.\u201d The 37-year-old said the business does logos and other branding material for female entrepreneurs. \u201cCertain things like logos are so expensive when you\u2019re starting off your business, and not all entrepreneurs have the resources or money. I didn\u2019t. So I wanted to make it accessible to them so they wouldn\u2019t have to struggle like I did. \u201cWe also mentor female business owners, pair them up with other mentors, have sessions teaching them about the different aspects of entrepreneurship, the financial part, the mental health part, how to build your brand and scale your business.\u201d Gomez said the organisation has been on hiatus for the last year, but she was building a camp for young girls who wanted to become entrepreneurs. She said when she visited schools as part of the 40 under 40 influencer programme with the Ministry of Youth Development and National Service, the children wanted to know how to start businesses. \u201cThey know they have to finish school and get their subjects, but they\u2019ll say, 'I want to be a vet yes, but I want to open my own veterinary clinic, how do I do that?' Or, 'I can draw, how can I start designing clothes based on my drawing skills?' They have this entrepreneurial spirit I think we need to tap into more and develop, so I wanted EmpowHerTT to fill that gap.\u201d Gomez said mentorship is important, as everyone needs accountability partners and guides. She sits on the advisory board of SPOTT \u2013 a professional development mentorship organisation that spans across Washington DC and Trinidad and Tobago. \u201cThere were people who went the same route we\u2019re trying to go before us. It\u2019s important we be that guide for the next generation, and let our stories be the building blocks for those coming up. I don\u2019t think anyone needs to be left alone to figure it out, they could figure it out with guidance. Nothing is new under the sun and nobody is going to do something new that was never done before. So as much as people could, they should find someone who they can mentor and guide, as that could make all the difference. \u201cThere are people who don\u2019t have friends, people who can\u2019t talk to their family members, parents, siblings, so a mentor can fill that gap, even if it\u2019s not in a professional capacity; just being that person for somebody else.\u201d Gomez said her plans for the future are to have Avelle become a fully-functional all-female boutique brand agency working for local and international clients in the next five years. \u201cA dream of mine is to have a commercial building that would be the hub for EmpowHerTT, a co-working and networking space. If an entrepreneur needs a space for a pop-up on a Saturday, they can come and use that space, outfit it the way they like and pop-up. They don\u2019t have to go out somewhere and rent every month to have a store. We\u2019d have office spaces as well. \u201cI want to keep on growing and doing what God sent me here to do. I feel like I make a difference in people\u2019s lives. When I finish a tour speaking about branding, people come and tell me they learned about their values and standing in their power from their parents, which they thought had become second nature. But I remind people these are the same values that will open doors and get you opportunities. You just need to be authentic and be yourself.\u201d Gomez had some advice for female entrepreneurs. \u201cYou miss the chances you don\u2019t take. You really have to be able to go out there and take the chances, take the risks, make sure it\u2019s a calculated risk but take the chances. I love to say 'shoot your shot' because you never know. You want to work with someone, send them an email, jump in their DMs. Create the opportunities you want, because we can\u2019t always depend on people to create it for us.\u201d", "summary": "<p><img width=\"825\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/23235973-825x510.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>Business owner, brand manager and women\u2019s empowerment advocate Avalon Gomez said her community refers to her as a \"dot connector\" and \"the ultimate multi-hyphenate.</p>\n<p>Gomez started out working in corporate finance and banking, transitioning to marketing and then party promotion.

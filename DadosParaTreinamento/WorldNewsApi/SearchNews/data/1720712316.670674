The pair, who were married for 14 years, recently announced their separation - a revelation that sent ripples through the entertainment industry. It's been suggested that Ruth was deeply unsettled by claims linking the separation to Eamonn's health struggles. There are now whispers circulating that Ruth stumbled upon correspondences between her spouse and another woman on a laptop, the Mirror reports. An inside source confided in The Sun saying: \"Ruth was completely taken by surprise when she saw the messages. She had no idea what had been going on between them. She was devastated. Not only was she very upset but she was also angry.\" Earlier this week, friends closely connected to the Loose Women anchor - who is taking a breather from the ITV programme to process her divorce - relayed that there's no going back for the duo. For the remainder of the month, Ruth has dedicated herself to some time off work while Eamonn has already dived back into his GB News presentational assignments. Finding out that her husband is receiving comfort from another woman, whom he's regularly been seen with, has left Ruth feeling \"hurt\". The woman, who is in her forties, has apparently formed a close bond with Eamonn over the past few years, where he took her to various outings including a safari park, a Manchester United match, and a Beyonce concert. An official representative for Ruth has confirmed: \"Ruth had holiday time booked from Loose Women and has extended her leave. She's looking forward to returning to the show in due course.\" Not long after the news of their separation came out, Eamonn expressed gratitude to GB News viewers: \"So here we are on this Tuesday morning and a lot of politics.\" \"Just before we move on I would just like to thank people for your support for Ruth and I over the last few days as to the news of our separation. Your support for both of us is very much appreciated.\" Meanwhile, Ruth has been sharing updates on social media during her absence from Loose Women, including details of her divorce makeover. Last month, they announced their split via a joint statement that read: \"Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.\" It is known that Eamonn has moved out of the family home since then. Mirror Online has reached out to Eamonn's representatives for a statement. However, Ruth's spokesperson chose not to comment.

In a typically bellicose speech at the St Petersburg Economic Forum this week, Putin also predicted that Nato would fail to protect Europe in a war with Russia. \u201cEurope does not have a developed early warning system. In this sense they are more or less defenceless,\u201d he said, sitting on stage alongside Luis Arce, Bolivia\u2019s president, and Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe\u2019s president. Putin has previously boasted of Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal but he intensified his rhetoric this week at the forum, held as Nato allies marked the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings at Normandy. This included using one of his first interviews with Western media to claim that he had no intention of attacking Nato, although he also said that he was prepared to arm allies of Russia with long-range missiles to strike Europe. During his four-hour speech and question and answer session on Friday at the end of the business-orientated forum, the moderator asked Putin if he should hold a \u201cnuclear pistol\u201d to the West.", "summary": "<![CDATA[<p><a class=\"ck-custom-link\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/05/vladimir-putin-would-eat-keir-starmer-for-breakfast/\">Vladimir Putin</a> has warned that Europe is \u201cdefenceless\u201d and unprepared for a nuclear conflict with Russia.</p>]]>", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/06/08/russia-ukraine-war-putin-europe-nuclear-weapons/", "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2024/06/08/TELEMMGLPICT000380931000_17178644359950_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqtKJCZXa1_G6e09cbPwU-QHwSCF1R0VweJ7DS2UnVMSQ.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:57:08", "author": "James Kilner", "authors": ["James Kilner"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.024}

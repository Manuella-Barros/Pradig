In a new interview with Vulture, the 50-year-old actress revealed that she was shocked when she first heard Swift, 34, give a nod to American Pie in her song \"So High School.\" In the nostalgic track, which is featured on the superstar's latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift sings, \"I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night / Your friends are around, so be quiet / I'm trying to stifle my sighs / 'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you.\" Hannigan, a self-described Swiftie, recalled that she had \"a little countdown\" going ahead of the album's release at midnight on April 19 and preemptively cleared her night of any plans or potential interruptions so she could savor the new songs alone. \"I texted my kids, 'Don\u2019t bug me, say \u2018good night,\u2019 just pretend I\u2019m not here,' because I am going to listen to this album without any interruption. I listened to the first part, went to sleep, and woke up to, 'Holy cow, she\u2019s released a second part!' \" the How I Met Your Mother star told Vulture. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Then she got to the 22nd track, \"So High School,\" which fans have theorized is about Swift's romance with NFL star Travis Kelce. \"I was like, 'What?!' I thought maybe I was still sort of sleeping and imagining it. But when I heard it, I was freaking out,\" Hannigan said. \"I woke up my entire family who seemed less enthusiastic than I\u2019d like them to be. Then I called a friend, and she and I had a nice freakout together. I was so happy.\" She jokingly added, \"Basically, I was on the date with Travis and Taylor.\" Hannigan had another pinch-me moment not long after when her Dancing with the Stars partner, Sasha Farber, shared a clip on Instagram of the pair driving around listening to \"So High School\" together \u2014 and Swift liked the post. Hannigan said it's fun to know the famous duo are fans of the 1999 comedy classic, which also starred Jason Biggs, Chris Klein and Eugene Levy. \"Well, it\u2019s not like I ever sat there and thought, 'Oh, I wonder if Taylor and Travis have watched American Pie.' But I do have to say that in the past 25 years, people ask me, 'Oh, what do you get recognized for?' And I always say that it depends where I am. If I were at a football game, it would definitely be American Pie,\" she told Vulture. \"So it\u2019s not that big of a leap to think that Travis had watched it.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Hannigan also opened up to Vulture about the audition process for American Pie, which will mark its 25th anniversary on Sunday, July 9. She recalled her manager sending her a copy of the script for the movie and telling her, \u201cYou\u2019re either going to love it or hate it. People are very divided.\" She said she was \"intrigued\" by the project and quickly zeroed in on the character of Michelle. \"I loved the way she talked. There were question marks after pretty much most of her sentences, including the ones about her times at band camp. I could hear her voice in my head immediately. And she was quirky,\" she explained to the outlet, noting that she also appreciated the character's arc and that Michelle was so different from the character she was playing on Buffy the Vampire Slayer at the time. \"Then, obviously, you\u2019re sort of thinking one thing the whole time and she surprises you at the end,\" Hannigan continued of Michelle. \"I was already playing, like, the perfect person on Buffy, and Michelle was the opposite.\" The actress also remembered feeling a bit put off during her audition when the directors critiqued her performance for being too quirky. \"I was confused and really frustrated. I remember calling my manager\u2019s assistant and saying that I didn\u2019t even want to go to the callback, and the movie wasn\u2019t going to be any good,\" she told Vulture. \"I\u2019m totally throwing the casting director under the bus, but this is what happened. Facts. Sorry.\"", "summary": "&#34;I was like, &#39;What?!&#39; I thought maybe I was still sort of sleeping and imagining it,&#34; the actress said of Swift&#39;s shout-out", "url": "https://people.com/alyson-hannigan-reacts-taylor-swift-mentioning-american-pie-song-so-high-school-8660154", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/gpz6RSXj77qoANvU-mQh5T8I4yE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/alyson-hannigan-taylor-swift-tout-060724-f0a3e7d43108435da551d96ed28ec31d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:21:12", "author": "Erin Clack", "authors": ["Erin Clack"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.189}

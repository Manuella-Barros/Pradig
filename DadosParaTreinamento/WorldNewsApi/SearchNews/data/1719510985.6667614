{"id": 223723630, "title": "What is air turbulence and how worried should I be about it?", "text": "Turbulence has always been a risk factor in aviation, but the ferocity of \u201csudden extreme turbulence\u201d experienced on a Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore this week was out of the ordinary. In a separate incident on Sunday, six passengers and six crew members were injured following turbulence on a flight from Doha, Qatar, to Ireland. The death of a passenger in the Singapore Airlines incident, multiple serious injuries to others and the extent of internal damage to the Boeing aircraft caused widespread shock. Inevitably, this prompted questions on whether climate disruption \u2013 ie, a warming world \u2013 is making turbulence worse? What happened? The plane encountered turbulence over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar. Data on Flight Radar 24, a website that compiles public information about flights, said it dropped from 37,000 feet to 31,000 in a few minutes but some media reports had erroneously reported the pilots\u2019 initial descent toward Bangkok as the turbulence event. \u201cWhile the aircraft may have continued to experience turbulence during that descent, it was a standard descent to a new flight level controlled by altitude selection in the aircraft\u2019s autopilot,\u201d it noted. It\u2019s unclear what caused the episode. Satellite data showed a strong storm beginning to form and bubble into higher elevations, suggesting the atmosphere in the region was becoming unstable. The plane was also moving toward other storms developing nearby. How rare are casualties? On international scheduled flights, fatalities directly caused by turbulence are rare. Pilots are usually able to give advance warning of most types of turbulence and ensure all on board are strapped in \u2013 the most important advice in minimising risk. On smaller private planes or business jets, serious injuries or deaths have been more frequent, with the US National Transport Safety Board recording more than 100 injuries and dozens of deaths in just over a decade on domestic flights, though fatalities mostly occurred when turbulence caused planes to crash. On bigger planes, turbulence presents risks of head or other injuries to people who could be thrown around the cabin if not strapped in, or they could be struck by flying debris. What is turbulence? This phenomenon is caused by the meeting of air at different temperatures, pressure or velocity, where different wind patterns collide \u2013 not unlike boats suddenly encountering choppy waters. While some weather and geographical conditions \u2013 such as thunderstorms, mountain ranges and appearance of certain clouds \u2013 can signal turbulence ahead, there is also \u201cclear-air turbulence\u201d at high altitudes, which can take pilots by surprise, occurring without warning. Forecasts showing incoming weather fronts or air flow over mountains could demonstrate a higher probability of clear-air turbulence. \u201cBut you can\u2019t see it,\u201d Stuart Fox, director of flight and technical operations at global airline body the International Air Transport Association (IATA), told the Guardian. \u201cAirflow strength and direction can change rapidly, and the forecasts can only indicate the likelihood.\u201d Such wind shears can knock aircraft off course and cause them to lose altitude quickly or lurch violently. Pilots can be guided by reports from aircraft ahead that they could be flying into the same turbulence. Certain parts of the world are known to present higher risk. The Singapore Airlines incident took place within the intertropical convergence zone, where thunderstorms are notorious. Thunderstorms are prominently displayed on navigation displays \u2013 but it may not be possible to circumvent a storm cluster, as such clusters can stretch beyond 50 nautical miles. Is climate disruption making turbulence worse? There is evidence that turbulence is worsening with climate change, as CO\u00b2 emissions affect air currents. Weather patterns are more disturbed with a warmer atmosphere. Scientists at Reading University have concluded that higher temperatures were increasing levels of turbulence encountered on transatlantic flights. Incidents of severe turbulence increased by 55 per cent between 1979 and 2020, owing to changes in wind velocity at high altitudes. Researcher Prof Paul Williams said this showed predicted choppier skies had already arrived and the aviation industry needed to invest in better systems to forecast and detect turbulence. Clear air turbulence, which occurs most frequently at high altitudes and in winter, could triple by the end of the century, he suggested, while other types of turbulence were increasing at all flight altitudes. While allowance has always to be made for the ferociousness of natural weather, his research suggests we could encounter bumpier flights in coming years, with all the risks that brings for passengers and crews. \u2013 Story updated on May 24th to include Flight Radar 24 explanation on the aircraft\u2019s \u201cstandard descent\u201d to a new flight level.", "summary": "Air turbulence, which can knock aircraft off course or  cause sudden loss of altitude, can prove fatal to people onboard", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/travel/2024/05/24/what-you-need-to-know-about-air-turbulence/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/q_5cE7Kpj-Ws50stMhOe8JaoTk4=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(1549x1217:1559x1227)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/ZZPTTGQNTKRXGUB2NNQVX4ANOA.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:16:48", "author": "Kevin O'Sullivan", "authors": ["Kevin O'Sullivan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.169}

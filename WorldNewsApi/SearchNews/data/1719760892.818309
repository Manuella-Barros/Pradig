{"id": 225034654, "title": "Harvey Weinstein to Appear Before Judge in Same Courthouse Where Trump is on Trial", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein is expected to appear before a judge Wednesday afternoon in the same New York City courthouse where former President Donald Trump is on trial. Weinstein is awaiting a retrial on rape charges after his 2020 conviction was tossed out. Wednesday\u2019s court hearing will address various legal issues related to the upcoming trial, which is tentatively scheduled for some time after Labor Day. Weinstein\u2019s original trial was held in the same courtroom where Trump is on trial now, but the two men are unlikely to bump into each other. Weinstein is in custody and will be brought to and from the courtroom under guard. He will be appearing in a courtroom on a different floor than where Trump is currently on trial. Weinstein was convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on Jessica Mann, an aspiring actor, and of sexually assaulting Miriam Haley, a former TV and film production assistant. But last month New York\u2019s highest court threw out those convictions after determining that the trial judge unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that weren\u2019t part of the case. Weinstein, 72, has maintained that any sexual activity was consensual. The New York ruling reopened a painful chapter in America\u2019s reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures. The #MeToo era began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein. Last week, prosecutors asked Judge Curtis Farber to remind Weinstein\u2019s lawyers not to discuss or disparage potential witnesses in public ahead of the retrial. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office argued that Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, made statements meant to intimidate Haley earlier this month. Speaking outside of court on May 1, Aidala said Haley lied to the jury about her motive in coming forward and that his team planned an aggressive cross-examination on the issue \u201cif she dares to come and show her face here.\u201d Aidala didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday about Bragg\u2019s request. Haley has said she does not want to go through the trauma of testifying again, \u201cbut for the sake of keeping going and doing the right thing and because it is what happened, I would consider it.\u201d Her attorney, Gloria Allred, declined to comment until after she attends Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as both Haley and Mann have. Weinstein, who had been serving a 23-year sentence in New York, was also convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and is still sentenced to 16 years in prison in California. ___ By PHILIP MARCELO Associated Press", "summary": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein is expected to appear before a judge Wednesday afternoon in the same New York&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/harvey-weinstein-to-appear-before-judge-in-same-courthouse-where-trump-is-on-trial/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Harvey Weinstein to Appear Before Judge in Same Courthouse Where Trump is on Trial</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/harvey-weinstein-to-appear-before-judge-in-same-courthouse-where-trump-is-on-trial/\">Harvey Weinstein to Appear Before Judge in Same Courthouse Where Trump is on Trial</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com\">The National Herald</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/harvey-weinstein-to-appear-before-judge-in-same-courthouse-where-trump-is-on-trial/", "image": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24149745669038-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:20:29", "author": "Achilleas Kouremenos", "authors": ["Achilleas Kouremenos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.28}

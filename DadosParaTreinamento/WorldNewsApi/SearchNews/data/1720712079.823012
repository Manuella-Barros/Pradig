The pooch escaped on May 27, and after a frantic search the family feared they may never see Mila, a miniature Dachshund, again. After 10 days scouring the village and nearby fields with a search party of friends, family and strangers, Karen Higgens, and her daughter, Alannah, 15, finally had a dash of hope when a local farmer reported that he\u2019d seen a dog \u2018dart in front of his machinery\u2019 in a field. Karen enlisted the help of Drone to Home - a volunteer charity helping owners locate their missing dogs using specialist drones - to help pinpoint the pooch's exact location - while Alannah sat by and waited for the shy dog to approach. Mila, almost two, made a beeline for her owner when they were reunited on June 5. Karen, a mum-of-three, from Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, said: \u201cShe is a miracle - we never gave up hope. I kept saying to my daughter, Alannah: 'We will find her and bring her home'.\" Timid Mila slipped out of an open door while with a dogsitter. Drone to Home with their specialist thermal imaging drones had travelled from across the country and were able to pinpoint Mila's location by hovering above the field and tracking with thermal imaging. Karen said drone charity then encouraged Alannah, her 15-year-old daughter, to see if she could coax Mila as she is the pup's 'favourite' person. She said: \"Alannah would sit in the field and walk around it, and Mila would come close to her and then dart away again.\u201d In the footage, you can see Mila following the trail left by Alannah's scent. Karen added: \"She hasn\u2019t left Alannah\u2019s side - she's her magnet. The bond between them is so strong.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Drone footage captured the emotional moment an owner was reunited with her sausage dog - after it went missing for 10 days. </p>", "url": "https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/watch-this/drone-footage-shows-emotional-moment-dronetohome-operators-find-missing-dog-and-reunite-with-owner-in-cambridgeshire-4658654", "image": "https://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/jpim-static/image/2024/06/09/11/31/drone-captures--1197381.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:24", "author": "Lucinda Herbert", "authors": ["Lucinda Herbert"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.058}

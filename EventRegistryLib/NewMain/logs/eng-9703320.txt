This matter should be resolved so that the MLAs can take the oath,\" he said.\n\nBandyopadhyay and Sarkar have resumed their sit-in protest near the statue of B R Ambedkar on the assembly premises, holding placards that read \"We are waiting for the governor.\" The two MLAs were elected during the by-polls held concurrently with the Lok Sabha elections but have refused to take the oath at Raj Bhavan. They argue that convention dictates the governor should assign either the Speaker of the House or the Deputy Speaker to administer the oath in the case of by-poll winners.\n\nThe governor had invited them to take the oath at Raj Bhavan last Wednesday, which they declined, citing procedural norms.

The special session is set to begin at 2pm on Friday, with the tenure to be decided in a Business Advisory Committee meeting slated for noon the same day.\n\nBanerjee emphasised the autonomy of the assembly while speaking to reporters.He stated, \"If someone thinks that we are helpless, then he or she is wrong. The assembly is not helpless, and everything is not in the hands of the Governor. You can't just force everything down our throats; there are rules, regulations, and constitutional norms. All of us have to abide by them.\"\n\nTwo newly elected Trinamool Congress MLAs, who have been staging a sit-in protest at the West Bengal Assembly premises, continue to demand that they be sworn in at the House rather than at Raj Bhavan, following an invitation from Governor C V Ananda Bose. Baranagar MLA Sayantika Bandyopadhyay and Bhagabangola legislator Rayat Hossain Sarkar have been protesting since June 27, with their sit-in extending through June 28, July 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nDespite being declared winners in the assembly by-polls held concurrently with the Lok Sabha elections, Bandyopadhyay and Sarkar have yet to assume their roles as elected representatives due to the pending swearing-in process. The Speaker has previously sought the intervention of President Droupadi Murmu to resolve the issue and has accused the governor of turning it into an ego battle.\n\n\"The governor is deliberately creating an impasse. He has turned it into an ego battle. This matter should be resolved so that the MLAs can take the oath,\" Banerjee declared.\n\nPersisting in their protest, Bandyopadhyay and Sarkar have situated themselves near the statue of B R Ambedkar on the assembly premises, holding placards with messages such as \"We are waiting for the governor.\"\n\nThe two MLAs were elected during the by-polls but have declined the governor's invitation to take the oath at Raj Bhavan last Wednesday, citing procedural norms. They argue that it is conventional for the governor to assign either the Speaker of the House or the Deputy Speaker to administer the oath for by-poll winners.\n\nSpeaker Biman Banerjee's efforts to enlist the President's intervention underscore the significance of resolving this issue to enable the newly elected representatives to assume their legislative duties. According to Banerjee, procedural norms and constitutional guidelines must be respected, which includes the governor allowing the swearing-in to take place within the assembly.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

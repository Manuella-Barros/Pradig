You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA thunderstorm warning has been issued for a large area of the country later this week including part of the North East as temperatures climb.\n\nThe Met Office has warned that heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop on Thursday, August 1, and may lead to some disruption in the affected area. While most of the North East will miss out on the worst of the weather, the Yellow warning extends from the south into the region as far as Peterlee in County Durham.\n\nThe warning is in force for the full 24 hours of Thursday, during which spray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures, forecasters said. There is also a chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services where flooding or lightning strikes occur.\n\nREAD MORE: Most and least expensive areas of Tynemouth and North Shields revealed - one street's average house price is \u00a31m\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nIn addition, there is a \"slight chance\" that power cuts could impact homes and businesses, that properties could sustain damage from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds, and that fast flowing or deep floodwater may cause danger to life, the Met Office cautioned. The weather warning reads: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out across parts of England and Wales on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"The exact location of showers is still uncertain and some places will stay dry all day. However, where the showers do occur they could be torrential, with the additional hazards of lightning, hail and gusty winds. The heaviest showers could result in 20-30 mm within an hour, with 24 hour accumulations possibly reaching as much as 70-90 mm where multiple showers affect the same location.\"\n\nThe forecast currently suggests that the North East area covered by the warning will escape the stormy conditions - Thursday's weather forecast for Hartlepool, for example, predicts sunny intervals all day with just a 20% chance of rain. However, the Met Office advises staying up to date with the latest forecast in the run-up to August 1, as this may change given the current uncertainty of the warning.\n\nIt comes as the North East is set to join most of the UK in welcoming plenty of warm and sunny weather this week, with the potential for some parts of the country to reach heatwave criteria at the end of July. The jet stream weakened to the west of the UK over the weekend, generating an area of high pressure - meaning the air is sinking from higher in the atmosphere, which brings drier, settled and sunnier weather, the Met Office explained.\n\nA UK heatwave threshold is met when a location records a period of at least three consecutive days with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding the heatwave temperature threshold. This threshold varies by county, standing at 25\u00b0C in the North East - and the forecast for the week ahead isn't far off, with highs in the early to mid-twenties expected consistently across the region over the next few days.

Thunderstorms are predicted to roll over London. The warning is due to last from 12pm today until 11.59pm tomorrow on Thursday.\n\nDespite being one of the hottest weeks of the year with a mini-heatwave, the rain is set to return. Storms are likely to break out later this afternoon and evening.\n\nThe yellow warning spans across the whole of the South East of the UK, over all of London and Kent and reaching as far as Ipswich in Suffolk in the east and Weymouth in the west. On Thursday, it will extend to most of England and Wales.\n\nThe Met Office said: \"Where these occur, 20 to 30 mm of rain is possible within an hour, and perhaps as much as 50 mm in two hours; the latter more likely across southeast England and parts of East Anglia during the evening. Lightning will be an additional hazard.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Amazon wireless headphones that 'don't fall out of your ears' down from \u00a380 to less than \u00a320\n\nThe Met Office gave their verdict for what to expect on Thursday. A spokesperson said: \"Whilst there is some uncertainty, thunderstorms may affect southeast England during the early hours of Thursday, perhaps also extending into parts of East Anglia. Where these occur, rain accumulations of 25-40 mm are possible in 1 hour, with a small risk of over 60mm in 2-3 hours, and accompanied by frequent lightning at times.\n\nThey added: \"Scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms are then expected to develop through Thursday afternoon and evening across parts of central, southern and eastern England, and perhaps also south Wales. These have the potential to produce 50 mm or more in 1-2 hours, along with gusty winds, large hail, and the risk of surface water flooding.\"\n\nHeavy showers are supposed to hit the north in the morning too.\n\nThe forecaster advised those in areas at risk of flash floods to prepare a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. Part of this could be preparing for power cuts - so gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essentials are a good idea.\n\nThe Met Office advised: \"Prepare to protect your property and people from injury. Before gusty winds arrive, check to ensure moveable objects or temporary structures are well secured. Items include; bins, garden furniture, trampolines, tents, gazebos, sheds, and fences.\"\n\nEnsure you check road conditions if driving or bus and train timetables to avoid delays and amend your travel plans where necessary. The warning is yellow because it has a very low likelihood of having a medium impact on people in the area, the Met Office said.\n\nBecause lightning is a possibility the Met Office gave some advice if you get caught outside during the storms. A spokesperson said: \"If you find yourself outside and hear thunder, protect yourself by finding a safe enclosed shelter (such as a car). Do not shelter under or near trees, or other structures which may be struck by lightning. If you are on an elevated area move to lower ground.\"\n\nGet the biggest stories from around London straight to your inbox.

Temperatures exceeded 30C in parts of the UK on Tuesday, July 30, and despite a thunderstorm weather alert in place tomorrow, the warm weather looks set to continue.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a yellow heat health alert until Friday, warning of the potential significant impact hot weather can have on the health and social care sector, and the Met Office has reminded the public about high UV levels during clear and sunny days.\n\nFamilies everywhere may be looking to make the most of the sunshine after many schools broke up last week, especially as weather forecasters predict a steady end to the hot spell over the coming few days. Temperatures are expected to fall after a round of thunderstorms, expected to hit on Thursday, August 1, and more rain appears to be on its way in the South West.\n\nRead more:\n\nPolice called to row at Exeter car boot sale Family's holiday from hell with 'faeces on wall' at West Country campsite\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Holley said: \"While there is often some uncertainty during thundery breakdowns, we're monitoring several areas that could see some thunderstorms on Wednesday, but more especially Thursday. There is a small chance in parts of south and southeast England as early as Wednesday, perhaps more likely on Wednesday night, with other areas of heavy and locally thundery rain developing across portions of Wales, the Midlands and northern England later on Wednesday night and into Thursday morning.\n\n\"In addition, scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms may break out on Thursday afternoon and evening across parts of central, southern and eastern England, along with perhaps south Wales, which may produce gusty winds, large hail and the risk of surface water flooding. The heaviest downpours could produce in excess of 25mm of rain in less than an hour, with disruption possible in some areas. This is an evolving story, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest forecast during the next couple of days.\"\n\nA severe thunderstorm warning is in place across parts of northern and eastern Devon from 1am - 11.59pm on Thursday. The Met Office said: \"Multiple rounds of heavy showers and thunderstorms are forecast on Thursday, and may lead to some disruption.\"\n\nThe Exeter-based forecasters warns of difficult driving conditions and potential flash flooding and deep water may cause' danger to life'. Power cuts may also occur and homes and businesses may face lightning strikes.\n\nThough temperatures are expected to stay in the 20s over the coming week, it is a return to the 21C-22C we have been used to. In its long-range forecast, the Met Office says there is a \"chance\" of more warm spells over August, but temperatures are more likely to be \"close to or just slightly below the average\".

Temperatures as high as 30C could be seen over the coming days, but there will be a major change towards the end of the week.\n\nA yellow warning for thunderstorms has been put in place for parts of Wales and England from noon on Thursday, August 1, until just before midnight.\n\nBefore that Wales will see a mini-heatwave with highs of 30C in parts of Monmouthshire, and highs 20s elsewhere. The warm surge is down to a wave of high pressure across the country and warm air rising from the south, creating dry, fine and sunny conditions and bringing temperatures up.

The warning states: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out across parts of England and Wales on Thursday afternoon. The exact location of showers is still uncertain and some places will stay dry all day.\"\n\nIt adds: \"However, where the showers do occur they could be torrential, with the additional hazards of lightning, hail and gusty winds. The heaviest showers could result in 20-30 mm within an hour, with 24-hour accumulations possibly reaching as much as 70-90 mm where multiple showers affect the same location.\"\n\nThe areas covered by the warning in Wales are Blaenau Gwent; Bridgend; Caerphilly; Cardiff; Denbighshire; Flintshire; Merthyr Tydfil; Monmouthshire; Neath Port Talbot; Newport; Powys; Rhondda Cynon Taf; Torfaen; Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham.\n\nIt is not all bad news though as the long-range forecast shows more settled weather for the start and middle of August. The Met Office long-range UK forecast into the start of August is showing that it will tend to be \"drier and brighter much of the time\", although there is also the small possibility of some thundery showers spreading in from Europe.\n\nThe forecast up to August 11 says: \"There are signs that a more widely settled period becomes more probable towards mid-August. Temperatures during this period will probably be close to or slightly above average overall, with the likelihood of some very warm conditions developing in the south and perhaps parts of the east at times.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cathy_owen@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Cathy Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency":

A build-up of high cloud may turn the skies a little hazy at times. Maximum temperature 27C (80.6F).\"\n\nIt added they'll be 'very warm' sunshine again on Wednesday.\n\nBut as Wednesday closes, the site said 'an increasing chance of showers, which could turn thundery' could take its place, which should 'clear eastwards on Thursday with a fresher Friday offering bright spells and showers'.\n\nA 12-hour weather warning covering much of the UK - including the Black Country, Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire - is in place from midday until 11.59pm on Thursday.\n\nThe warning has been issued from midday until 11.59pm on Thursday and covers much of the country, including Shropshire, parts of Powys, Herefordshire, Staffordshire and the Black Country.\n\nIn their warning, forecasters said: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out across parts of England and Wales on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"The exact location of showers is still uncertain and some places will stay dry all day. However, where the showers do occur they could be torrential, with the additional hazards of lightning, hail and gusty winds.\"\n\n\"The heaviest showers could result in 20-30 mm within an hour, with 24 hour accumulations possibly reaching as much as 70-90 mm where multiple showers affect the same location.\"\n\nThe Met Office says the weather could cause some disruption including flooding that could cause road closures, travel delays and cancellations, and power cuts.\n\nMet Office spokesperson Nicola Maxey warned: \"As we move into the middle of the week we start to see an increasing risk of thunderstorms developing, particularly in parts of England and Wales, and the rain is such that it could cause some local disruption.\n\n\"This is the sort of rainfall that could cause surface water flooding and heavy rain that takes a while to clear away.\n\n\"There could also be some lightning potential for hail and gusty conditions.\"\n\nThe warning covered most of England, stretching from the south coast up through the Midlands and reaching as far north as Newcastle.\n\nA yellow heat health alert was stamped down today across all of England, which will be in place until at least Friday, August 2.\n\nAlthough most are happy to see the sun come out, it does bring with it warnings to stay safe during unusually hot periods of the year.\n\nPublished on the Government website, tips on how to keep cool are: Keeping out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, planning all active hobbies in the cooler parts of the day, closing windows and curtains in rooms that face the sun, drinking plenty of fluids and limiting alcohol intake, wearing suitable clothes, applying sunscreen, and seeking shade.\n\nLocals looking to make the most of the sunshine should brace for last-orders to be sounded around Wednesday afternoon, but will see small windows of warm weather in the following days - so those working throughout the week should get a chance to soak it up before the heatwave ends.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_coles@expressandstar.com", "name": "Daniel Coles", "type": "author",

The Met Office says it is important to read the content of yellow warnings to determine which weather situation is being covered by the yellow warning.\n\nGet more news from SurreyLive straight to your inbox for free here.", "source": {"uri": "getsurrey.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Surrey Advertiser Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_shipp@getsurrey.co.uk", "name": "Victoria Shipp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exeter"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Exeter"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraced_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terraced house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorking", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorking"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dorking"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guildford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guildford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woking", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woking"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woking"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article24106270.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_GettyImages-1234595917-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771999", "eventUri": "eng-9771999", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 242, "textEnd": 250}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe Met Office has extended and expanded its weather warning for thunderstorms this week. A yellow warning has been issued for a large part of Wales on Thursday, after some of the hottest days this year so far.\n\nThe time for the start of the warning has now been brought forward and a larger area of Wales is now covered. It is now in place from midnight on Thursday until just before midnight on Friday - brought forward by 12 hours.\n\nThere could be between 25-40mm of rain in one hour in places where the thunderstorms hit, with a small risk of over 60mm in two to three hours, accompanied by frequent lightning at times.

Where these occur, rain accumulations of 25-40 mm are possible in one hour, with a small risk of over 60mm in two to three hours, and accompanied by frequent lightning at times. Elsewhere, an area of showery rain is likely to develop and move northeastwards across parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England.\n\n\"This will be heavy and perhaps thundery at times, persisting through Thursday morning before easing towards midday. Some areas could receive rain accumulations of 25-50 mm over the course of a few hours.\"\n\nIt adds: \"Scattered heavy showers and thunderstorms are then expected to develop through Thursday afternoon and evening across parts of central, southern and eastern England, and perhaps also south Wales. These have the potential to produce 50 mm or more in one to two hours, along with gusty winds, large hail, and the risk of surface water flooding.\"\n\nThe areas covered by the warning are Blaenau Gwent; Bridgend; Caerphilly; Cardiff; Carmarthenshire; Ceredigion; Conwy; Denbighshire; Flintshire; Gwynedd; Merthyr Tydfil; Monmouthshire; Neath Port Talbot; Newport; Powys; Rhondda Cynon Taf; Swansea; Torfaen; Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham.\n\nMet Office deputy chief meteorologist David Oliver said: \"There's a chance of some thundery showers across some southern areas of England on Wednesday, then on Thursday there is a signal for some potentially very heavy thunderstorms to develop. There are still details to confirm during this period, but in any event there is a chance of some impacts on each day, especially Thursday.\n\n\"The heaviest showers on Thursday could result in 20-30mm of rain within an hour, with daily totals possibly reaching as high as 90mm if multiple showers impact the same location. Lightning and hail present additional hazards, with disruption likely for some. This is a developing element of the forecast, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest outlook in the coming days.\"\n\nThursday's thundery breakdown heralds a shift to a more unsettled weather regime for the UK later in the week and into the weekend, with a westerly weather regime likely to bring outbreaks of rain at times, albeit with some drier interludes.", "source": {"uri":

Consider if your location is at risk of flash flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. Prepare to protect your property and people from injury. Before gusty winds arrive, check to ensure moveable objects or temporary structures are well secured. Items include; bins, garden furniture, trampolines, tents, gazebos, sheds, and fences. Give yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary. People cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. It's easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items. If you find yourself outside and hear thunder, protect yourself by finding a safe enclosed shelter (such as a car). Do not shelter under or near trees, or other structures which may be struck by lightning. If you are on an elevated area move to lower ground. Be prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.\n\nFor breaking news in your

However, it's only really continued across England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen cloudier skies at times, along with cooler air and temperatures around average.\n\nThis contrast will continue in the coming days too, with heat and humidity persisting across England and Wales. Temperatures here will reach the mid to high 20s, and some places the low 30s.\n\nBy the start of the weekend, cooler, fresher air will have reached all parts of the UK, but as that transition gradually takes place from midweek, there'll be showers and thunderstorms breaking out.\n\nIn the UK during summer, it's quite common for spells of hot weather to come crashing to a dramatic end with thunderstorms, and this case looks to be no different.\n\nHeat in the atmosphere is a form of energy that can fuel weather and allow thunderstorms to happen. So far, we've had the heat, but lacked another key ingredient - moisture.\n\nHowever, that is set to change from Wednesday onwards, as a plume of humid air extends northwards out of France, seeping over England and Wales. With this ingredient in place, combined with a few other factors, the scene will be set for heavy showers and thunderstorms to happen.\n\nGiven the focus of heat and humidity across England and Wales, this is where any thunderstorms are likely to be.\n\nThe Met Office has issued two yellow warnings for thunderstorms - one valid for Wednesday across southeast England, and another for Thursday that covers much of England and Wales.\n\nA variety of impacts are possible, ranging from torrential rain, hail and lightning to gusty winds and localised flash flooding.\n\nWhilst confidence is high that the areas highlighted by the yellow warnings will be most at risk from thunderstorms, not everyone in the warning areas will see them, as the precise detail is uncertain.\n\nThis is because individual thunderstorms are usually small in terms of aerial coverage - typically no more than a few square kilometres, making it very tricky to pinpoint exactly where will be hit. One location can see torrential rain, whereas another place only a short distance away can see little or nothing.\n\nAs an analogy for this, think of what happens when you heat a saucepan of water. When it reaches boiling point, you know that there will definitely be bubbles of water forming in the area of water, but predicting precisely where each bubble will form is tricky.\n\nEven though we are only 24 hours away from when the first batch of thunderstorms is likely to hit, given the uncertainties mentioned above, there is still scope for details to change.\n\nSo, it's worth keeping a close eye on the forecast, as I have no doubt that the warnings will be updated, and maybe even extended and escalated, as the situation evolves.\n\nI'll be watching things closely in the coming days and posting more regular updates from my X, formerly Twitter, account here, and on my Facebook page here.", "source": {"uri": "channel4.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Channel 4"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_dutton@channel4.com", "name": "Liam Dutton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://fournews-assets-prod-s3-ew1-nmprod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2024/07/shutterstock_editorial_12952256a-2000x1333.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771999", "eventUri": "eng-9771999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

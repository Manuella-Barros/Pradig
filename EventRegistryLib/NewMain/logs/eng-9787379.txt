or by 7 August.\n\nRepublican leaders in the state had warned they would enforce the law and, though lawmakers eventually created an exemption as they have done in the past, Democrats said an early rollcall would pre-empt further risks of their candidates being excluded from the ballot.\n\nDelegates do not need to vote on the vice-presidential pick.\n\nMs Harris is expected to name her running mate by Monday.", "source": {"uri": "adaderana.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ada Derana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_District_Attorney's_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco District Attorney's Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://adaderanaenglish.s3.amazonaws.com/1722669805-KAMALA-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787379", "eventUri": "eng-9787379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 2191, "textEnd": 2203}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2458, "textEnd": 2466}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 243, "relevance": 1}

Here's how the process worked", "body": "By ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nKamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall By SEUNG MIN KIM - Associated Press\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes on Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Who are the contenders? Answer with FRANCE 24's international affairs commentator Dougl...\n\nWASHINGTON -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nKamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall\n\nBy SEUNG MIN KIM - Associated Press\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes on Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov.

The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices, or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democrat governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nNow that Harris is the Democrats' presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democrat nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democrat delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \"a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature eventually made the change at the behest of Gov. Mike DeWine, also a Republican, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as planned.\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democrat nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nRobert Yoon, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "sasktoday.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "SaskToday.ca"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Here's how the process worked", "body": "Harris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes on Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov.

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nKamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall\n\nBy SEUNG MIN KIM - Associated Press\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWaterloo residents have more than 1,000 signatures on petition to put high school plan on the ballot Timeline: Deere has cut 2,700 jobs in 10 months in Iowa and Illinois Helicopter crashed near Nashua after striking powerlines, killing pilot UPDATE: Man charged with TC damage said he was 'blackout drunk' West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M Bremer Avenue bridge in Waverly to be demolished, closed for a year starting Thursday Autistic man accused of breaking into co-worker's home to plant letter, smear boyfriend Pablo's Mexican Grill marking 20 years on Main Street in downtown Cedar Falls UAW releases statement on John Deere layoffs, says cuts 'kill good American jobs' Man sentenced to prison in shooting that paralyzed robbery victim Lawsuit by man paralyzed in Waterloo officer-involved shooting thrown out 2024 Courier Male Athlete of the Year: Jesup's Jack Miller 'It helped me a lot': Suni Lee has 'needed' heart-to-heart with teammates before Team USA won gold Cedar Falls City Council to consider items related to more planned roundabouts STEVE CORBIN: Economists say Trump poses a threat to US economy\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes on Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Here's how the process worked", "body": "By ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Vatican rejects appeals to save two Catholic parishes in St. Louis A beloved South Grand convenience store employee was killed by customer, witnesses say Michael Siani's injury will throw open range of options in center field: Cardinals Extra Videos show CVPA shooter stalking hallways before police storm the St. Louis school McClellan: Maybe Outsiders aren't the answer for St. Louis Man claims to be editor of St. Louis' Riverfront Times, defends site's OnlyFans content Transgender woman's use of locker room at Ellisville gym sparks outcry from conservatives Firm with ties to Indian tech execs made $1.5 million donation to Missouri treasurer BenFred: Hey, maybe we weren't crazy for thinking Caitlin Clark should have made Team USA Editorial: Our endorsements in Missouri's GOP and Democratic gubernatorial primaries St. Louis restaurant openings and closings for July St. Louis County overpaid dozens of employees for years. Some had already quit. Sultan: What J.D. Vance's obsession with childless cat women is really about Target plans another location in St. Louis County\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes on Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

heritage, has formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination becoming the first Indian-American to win the nomination from a major political party and chose Minnesota Gov Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nHarris, 59, would face Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump, 78, in the general elections scheduled to be held on November 5.\n\nKamala Harris turns down Trump's election debate proposal\n\nHarris picked Minnesota Govenor Tim Walz, 60, to be her running mate on Tuesday morning ahead of the Philadelphia rally, Washington Post said quoting sources.\n\nWalz has served 12 years in Congress before he became Minnesota governor in 2018.\n\nEarlier last month, Harris abruptly thrust into the role of presidential candidate after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race for the White House.\n\nHarris' nomination became official on Monday night after she received 99 per cent of the votes of the pledged and automatic delegates at the conclusion of the roll call vote after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates.\n\nAs many as 4,567 delegates from across the country cast their vote for Harris.\n\nThe next steps in the nominating process include the certification of the roll call by the Democratic National Convention (DNC) secretary Jason Rae, and the acceptance of the nomination by Harris and her running mate, certified by DNC Chair (DNCC) Minyon Moore.\n\nThe Convention is to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22.\n\n\"With the support of 99 per cent of all participating delegates in the virtual roll call, Vice President Harris has historic momentum at her back as we embark on the final steps in officially certifying her as our party's nominee,' DNC chair Jaime Harrison and DNCC chair Minyon Moore said in a joint statement.\n\nLast Friday, Harris was declared the 2024 presidential nominee of the ruling Democratic Party after she won enough votes from Democratic delegates in a virtual roll call.\n\nA step away from breaking the last glass ceiling of the United States, Harris became the first ever woman of colour to be on the top of a presidential ticket of a major American political party.\n\nShe is also the first ever Indian American to be nominated as presidential candidate of either the Republican or the Democratic Party.\n\nHarris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was Indian and her father, Donald Jasper Harris, a Jamaican; both immigrants to the US.", "source": {"uri": "easternmirrornagaland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eastern

Here's how the process worked", "body": "By ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare.

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She passed the threshold of delegates needed in the virtual roll call on Friday.\n\nHer rise has included a surge in the polls to narrow the gap with former President Trump and take a slight lead in certain cases. She has also seen a massive fundraising haul in just the first few weeks of her candidacy.\n\nThe total number of delegates voting for Harris is 4,567.\n\nHarris's victory will make her the first woman of color to become a major party presidential nominee in U.S. history.\n\nThe DNC said the next step for the nominating process will be Convention Secretary Jason Rae certifying the roll call and Harris, along with her running mate, accepting the nomination. A \"celebratory\" roll call will take place at the Democratic convention in Chicago later this month.\n\n\"As we prepare to certify the nomination alongside Convention Secretary Rae, we know that we are all a part of an important piece of history,\" Harrison and Moore said. \"Soon, it will be time to come together in Chicago, where we will celebrate together and make clear to the American people that the Democratic Party is the party of freedom, of democracy, of rights, and of the people.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_gans@thehill.com", "name": "Jared Gans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyon_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minyon Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Rae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Virtual_Corporations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Virtual Corporations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/AP24214025952019-e1722727669403.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787379", "eventUri": "eng-9787379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Answer with FRANCE 24's international affairs commentator Dougl...\n\nWASHINGTON -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nKamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall\n\nBy SEUNG MIN KIM - Associated Press\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTom and Molly Bedell's West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M 'We'll miss the place': Home on Sioux City's north side on market for first time in decades A shellfish guest: Chesapeake blue crab found at Sioux City Library Sierra signage going up at former Sioux City Bed Bath & Beyond Sioux City's original guitar hero to be celebrated with a three-night musical extravaganza Olympic Athletics Results: USD's Chris Nilsen finishes 11th in pole vault group Police release name of man pulled from Floyd River Toast on Hill offering classy breakfast and lunch to Okoboji Lakes visitors A favorite Sioux City deli stages a comeback with a new lobby and full menu of sandwiches Simon Max Kaplan Fireworks serve as weekly grand finale for Arnolds Park's Saturday night concert series Sioux City schools vandalized with graffiti over weekend Sioux City Council to vote on resolution for faith-based treatment center City of Sioux City issues guidance for tree limb disposal Marriage licenses for August 5, 2024\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes on Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nPhotos: Kamala Harris through the years\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Here's how the process worked", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nKamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall By SEUNG MIN KIM - Associated Press\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov.

Harris, the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, is poised to secure the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.\n\nBy ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTom and Molly Bedell's West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M Sierra signage going up at former Sioux City Bed Bath & Beyond 'We'll miss the place': Home on Sioux City's north side on market for first time in decades A shellfish guest: Chesapeake blue crab found at Sioux City Library Sioux City's original guitar hero to be celebrated with a three-night musical extravaganza Olympic Athletics Results: USD's Chris Nilsen finishes 11th in pole vault group A favorite Sioux City deli stages a comeback with a new lobby and full menu of sandwiches Police release name of man pulled from Floyd River Toast on Hill offering classy breakfast and lunch to Okoboji Lakes visitors Simon Max Kaplan Fireworks serve as weekly grand finale for Arnolds Park's Saturday night concert series Five rescued after tree falls on Sioux City home; wind storm knocks out power, causes outages City of Sioux City issues guidance for tree limb disposal Sioux City Council to vote on resolution for faith-based treatment center Sioux City schools vandalized with graffiti over weekend\n\nDelegates to the Democratic National Convention began casting votes on Thursday to select their nominee for president, but unlike in past years, they did so not in the raucous party atmosphere of the convention floor or even during the convention itself. Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Harris on Friday secured the requisite number of delegates needed for the spot at the top of the party's presidential ticket, after virtual voting began Thursday.\n\n\"I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States,\" she said in a call with campaign supporters Friday.\n\nThe vice president said she would officially accept the nomination after voting closed.\n\nHarris' nomination in the roll call vote caps a whirlwind two weeks for the vice president, who launched her campaign after President Biden bowed out of the presidential race on July 21.\n\nThe roll call solidifies the general election match-up of Harris versus Trump, who received the Republican presidential nomination during the party's convention last month. While the GOP spent its four-day gathering in Milwaukee lambasting Mr. Biden for his policies and taking aim at his age, the party has had to quickly pivot to refocusing its efforts on Harris.\n\nThe vice president announced her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on the heels of Mr. Biden's decision to end his reelection bid. She swiftly received the president's endorsement and support from all Democratic leaders, including party elders and its rising stars.\n\nTo win the nomination, Harris needed to secure support from 2,350 out of more than 4,000 pledged and super delegates, her campaign said. She easily met that threshold Friday.\n\nHarris has not yet announced her running mate, but is expected to unveil her pick on Tuesday. Her campaign vetted about a dozen contenders, including a number of governors from battleground states that are crucial for winning in November.\n\nThe electronic voting by delegates began at 9 a.m. ET on Aug. 1 and closed at 6 p.m. ET on Aug. 5. Voting took place through an online platform operated by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nVoting delegates received a personalized and watermarked form to cast their vote. Votes were tallied by the DNC.\n\nMr. Biden amassed enough delegates in March to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, and the committee's rules didn't explicitly address how those delegates should be allocated after his withdrawal. Party rules state that delegates pledged to a candidate \"shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\"\n\nBut within days of launching her presidential campaign, Harris had received endorsements from nearly all state delegations, amounting to more than 3,700 pledged delegates. That support held, and Harris easily clinched the presidential nomination.\n\nMelissa Quinn\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

from a major political party, and chose Minnesota Gov Tim Walz as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nPhotograph: Courtesy, Tim Walz/X\n\nHarris, 59, would face Republican presidential candidate and former president Donald Trump, 78, in the general elections scheduled to be held on November 5.\n\nHarris picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, to be her running mate on Tuesday morning ahead of the Philadelphia rally, Washington Post said quoting sources.\n\nWalz has served 12 years in US Congress before he became Minnesota governor in 2018.\n\nEarlier last month, Harris was abruptly thrust into the role of presidential candidate after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race for the White House.\n\nHarris's nomination became official on Monday night after she received 99 per cent of the votes of the pledged and automatic delegates at the conclusion of the roll call vote after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates.\n\nAs many as 4,567 delegates from across the country cast their vote for Harris.\n\nThe next steps in the nominating process include the certification of the roll call by the Democratic National Convention (DNC) secretary Jason Rae, and the acceptance of the nomination by Harris and her running mate, certified by DNC chair (DNCC) Minyon Moore.\n\nThe convention is to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22.\n\n\"With the support of 99 per cent of all participating delegates in the virtual roll call, Vice President Harris has historic momentum at her back as we embark on the final steps in officially certifying her as our party's nominee,\" DNC chair Jaime Harrison and DNCC chair Minyon Moore said in a joint statement.\n\nLast Friday, Harris was declared the 2024 presidential nominee of the ruling Democratic Party after she won enough votes from Democratic delegates in a virtual roll call.\n\nA step away from breaking the last glass ceiling of the United States, Harris became the first ever woman of colour to be on the top of a presidential ticket of a major American political party.\n\nShe is also the first ever Indian American to be nominated as presidential candidate of either the Republican or the Democratic Party.\n\nHarris's mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was Indian and her father, Donald Jasper Harris, a Jamaican, both immigrants to the US.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com",

Here's how the process worked", "body": "By ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Here are the full results.", "body": "Washington -- The Democratic National Committee's virtual roll call vote has closed, and the Democratic Party announced that Vice President Kamala Harris received the votes of 99% of the participating delegates.\n\nIn a statement late Monday, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison and Minyon Moore, the Democratic National Convention committee chair, said that the roll call results would next be certified by the convention's secretary, Jason Rae, formalizing Harris' status as the Democratic nominee who will take on Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.\n\nHarrison and Moore said there would be a \"celebratory\" roll call at the convention later this month.\n\nThe roll call of state delegations had long been planned to take place virtually and weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which begins Aug. 19. Harris on Friday secured the requisite number of delegates needed for the spot at the top of the party's presidential ticket, after virtual voting began Thursday.\n\n\"I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States,\" she said in a call with campaign supporters Friday.\n\nThe vice president said she would officially accept the nomination after voting closed.\n\nHarris' nomination in the roll call vote caps a whirlwind two weeks for the vice president, who launched her campaign after President Biden bowed out of the presidential race on July 21.\n\nThe roll call solidifies the general election match-up of Harris versus Trump, who received the Republican presidential nomination during the party's convention last month. While the GOP spent its four-day gathering in Milwaukee lambasting Mr. Biden for his policies and taking aim at his age, the party has had to quickly pivot to refocusing its efforts on Harris.\n\nThe vice president announced her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on the heels of Mr. Biden's decision to end his reelection bid. She swiftly received the president's endorsement and support from all Democratic leaders, including party elders and its rising stars.\n\nTo win the nomination, Harris needed to secure support from 2,350 out of more than 4,000 pledged and super delegates, her campaign said. She easily met that threshold Friday.\n\nHarris has not yet announced her running mate, but is expected to unveil her pick on Tuesday. Her campaign vetted about a dozen contenders, including a number of governors from battleground states that are crucial for winning in November.\n\nThe electronic voting by delegates began at 9 a.m. ET on Aug. 1 and closed at 6 p.m. ET on Aug. 5. Voting took place through an online platform operated by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nVoting delegates received a personalized and watermarked form to cast their vote. Votes were tallied by the DNC.\n\nMr. Biden amassed enough delegates in March to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, and the committee's rules didn't explicitly address how those delegates should be allocated after his withdrawal. Party rules state that delegates pledged to a candidate \"shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\"\n\nBut within days of launching her presidential campaign, Harris had received endorsements from nearly all state delegations, amounting to more than 3,700 pledged delegates. That support held, and Harris easily clinched the presidential nomination.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyon_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minyon Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Rae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdelegate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superdelegate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/05/84ce3882-1500-410a-bbdc-5e655c597cbf/thumbnail/1200x630g2/129862ffaac4acb6c9dbe799e440459a/gettyimages-2163962508.jpg?v=33116e4d892fab6878b5c06299369826", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787379", "eventUri": "eng-9787379", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 836, "textEnd": 843}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 1421, "textEnd": 1428}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2557, "textEnd": 2563}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2591, "textEnd": 2597}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

president.\n\nDNC Chair Jaime Harrison said Harris received support from 99% of all participating delegates, totaling 4,567 votes.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has historic momentum at her back as we embark on the final steps in officially certifying her as our Party's nominee,\" Harrison said. \"We thank the thousands of delegates from all across the country who took seriously their responsibility throughout this process to make their voices -- and the voices of their communities -- heard,\" Harrison and Democratic National Convention Committee Chair Minyon Moore said.\n\nOnce the roll call is ratified by Democratic National Convention Secretary Jason Rae Harris will be the official Democratic candidate and face former President Donald Trump on the ballot in November.\n\nShe will be the first Black woman and first Asian woman to be a major party's nominee for president.\n\nThe roll call was implemented to address uncertainty on ballot deadlines in Ohio, which has since been settled, that forced the party to nominate a candidate ahead of the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19.\n\nBy Friday, less than a week later, Harris had met the threshold of support from delegates required to capture the nomination.\n\nHarris told campaign supporters on a phone call at the time that she was \"honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States.\"\n\n\"I will officially accept your nomination next week, once the virtual period is closed,\" she said.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her running mate on Tuesday before going on a barnstorming tour of battleground states around the country.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She was the only candidate to qualify. The DNC said 4,567 delegates cast their votes for her.\n\nMichigan had 125 of 138 delegates vote for Harris. Over 100 delegates were on a call late last month where the delegation pledged to support the vice president.\n\nMichigan Democratic delegates vote to give Harris their support for president\n\nThe next steps will be the certification of the roll call by the convention secretary, Jason Rae, and the acceptance of the nomination by Harris and her running mate, who as of early Tuesday still had not been named.\n\nThere will also be a celebratory roll call at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this month.\n\n\"With the support of 99% of all participating delegates in the virtual roll call, Vice President Harris has historic momentum at her back as we embark on the final steps in officially certifying her as our Party's nominee,\" DNC Chair Jaime Harrison and DNCC Chair Minyon Moore said in a statement. \"We thank the thousands of delegates from all across the country who took seriously their responsibility throughout this process to make their voices - and the voices of their communities - heard. As we prepare to certify the nomination alongside Convention Secretary Rae, we know that we are all a part of an important piece of history.\"\n\nHarris and her vice presidential pick will have fewer than 100 days to campaign before Nov. 5.\n\nShe's undertaking a swing-state tour that has the two holding rallies Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan, Thursday in North Carolina, Friday in Arizona, and Saturday in Nevada. The Associated Press reported a stop in Georgia was postponed due to Hurricane Debby and the North Carolina appearance could be affected.\n\nHarris didn't compete in a Democratic primary campaign this election cycle, which could potentially hamstring her, though she did introduce herself to voters during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and has held public events throughout her time as vice president.\n\nAs of Tuesday it did not appear that Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would debate ahead of Nov. 5, which would have given her an opportunity to showcase her policy goals and personality to a broader cross-section of voters.\n\nTrump and the Biden campaign agreed to two debates -- the first in June, which was hosted by CNN and led to a widespread lack of confidence in Biden's cognition, and a second on Sept. 10, hosted by ABC News.\n\nThe Trump campaign had been noncommittal about debating Harris since Biden announced in July he would step aside as the presumptive nominee and endorsed Harris to take over at the top of the ticket.\n\nHarris for President Co-chair Cedric Richmond said in a statement released Friday that Trump \"needs to man up\" and attend the previously agreed to debate on Sept. 10.\n\n\"He's got no problem spreading lies and hateful garbage at his rallies or in interviews with right-wing commentators. But he's apparently too scared to do it standing across the stage from the Vice President of the United States,\" Richmond said. \"Since he talks the talk, he should walk the walk and -- as Vice President Harris said earlier this week -- say it to her face on September 10. She'll be there waiting to see if he'll show up.\"\n\nTrump posted on social media over the weekend that he would only attend a Fox News debate on Sept. 4, though neither the Biden nor Harris campaigns ever agreed to attend a Fox debate.\n\n\"Kamala Harris doesn't have the mental capacity to do a REAL Debate against me, scheduled for September 4th in Pennsylvania,\" Trump posted. \"I'll see her on September 4th or, I won't see her at all.\"\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, California, in October 1964. She graduated from Howard University, a historically Black institution of higher education, in 1986 before receiving her law degree from the University of California in 1989.\n\nHarris worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, from 1990 until 1998. Her career as a prosecutor continued when she moved to the San Francisco District Attorney's office, where she worked as a managing attorney.\n\nShe spent time as the chief of the San Francisco City Attorney's Division on Children and Families and as the district attorney of San Francisco before California voters elected her attorney general in 2010.\n\nResidents in the Golden State then elected Harris to the U.S. Senate in 2016, where she stayed until she was sworn in as vice president in January 2021.\n\nHarris sought the Democratic presidential nomination during the 2020 primary, but dropped out two months before voting began.\n\nHarris is scheduled to give the convention keynote speech on Aug. 22, the final night of the gathering in Chicago. She'll likely be speaking to the largest audience she'll have in person and watching on television until election night.\n\nThat will provide a major opportunity for her to speak directly to the centrist and undecided voters who will determine the outcome of the November elections, including control of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.\n\nShould Harris win the Electoral College vote, she will become the country's first female president, the first president of South Asian descent and the second Black president when she's inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025.", "source": {"uri":

Current Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the Democratic nomination for president after receiving support from 99% of delegates inside her party in an online vote, Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison said.\n\nAccording to his statement, quoted by US media, a total of 4,567 party delegates supported Harris.\n\nCBS television pointed out that on Monday evening, Harris said that she would accept the offer to become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in the upcoming election. ABC, in turn, emphasized that the results of the voting must be officially confirmed by the secretary of the party's national convention in Chicago on August 19-22. However, in fact, after this vote, Harris sealed the Democratic nomination.\n\nLast Friday, Harris won the 1,976 votes she needed from Democratic delegates to become the nominee for president. Online voting to nominate Harris for the election began last Thursday.\n\nThe US presidential election will be held on November 5. The Democratic Party was supposed to be represented by Joe Biden, but after his failed performance in his June debate with Trump, calls for the incumbent head of state to pull out grew louder among Democrats.

They say he should focus solely on the economy and immigration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states, AP sources say.\n\nShe will introduce Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week.

That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.", "source":

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She was the only candidate to qualify. The DNC said 4,567 delegates cast their votes for her.\n\nThe next steps will be the certification of the roll call by the convention secretary, Jason Rae, and the acceptance of the nomination by Harris and her running mate, who as of early Tuesday still had not been named.\n\nThere will also be a celebratory roll call at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this month.\n\n\"With the support of 99% of all participating delegates in the virtual roll call, Vice President Harris has historic momentum at her back as we embark on the final steps in officially certifying her as our Party's nominee,\" DNC Chair Jaime Harrison and DNCC Chair Minyon Moore said in a statement. \"We thank the thousands of delegates from all across the country who took seriously their responsibility throughout this process to make their voices - and the voices of their communities - heard. As we prepare to certify the nomination alongside Convention Secretary Rae, we know that we are all a part of an important piece of history.\"\n\nHarris and her vice presidential pick will have fewer than 100 days to campaign before Nov. 5.\n\nShe's undertaking a swing-state tour that has the two holding rallies Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan, Thursday in North Carolina, Friday in Arizona, and Saturday in Nevada. The Associated Press reported a stop in Georgia was postponed due to Hurricane Debby and the North Carolina appearance could be affected.\n\nHarris didn't compete in a Democratic primary campaign this election cycle, which could potentially hamstring her, though she did introduce herself to voters during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and has held public events throughout her time as vice president.\n\nAs of Tuesday it did not appear that Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would debate ahead of Nov. 5, which would have given her an opportunity to showcase her policy goals and personality to a broader cross-section of voters.\n\nTrump and the Biden campaign agreed to two debates -- the first in June, which was hosted by CNN and led to a widespread lack of confidence in Biden's cognition, and a second on Sept. 10, hosted by ABC News.\n\nThe Trump campaign had been noncommittal about debating Harris since Biden announced in July he would step aside as the presumptive nominee and endorsed Harris to take over at the top of the ticket.\n\nHarris for President Co-chair Cedric Richmond said in a statement released Friday that Trump \"needs to man up\" and attend the previously agreed to debate on Sept. 10.\n\n\"He's got no problem spreading lies and hateful garbage at his rallies or in interviews with right-wing commentators. But he's apparently too scared to do it standing across the stage from the Vice President of the United States,\" Richmond said. \"Since he talks the talk, he should walk the walk and -- as Vice President Harris said earlier this week -- say it to her face on September 10. She'll be there waiting to see if he'll show up.\"\n\nTrump posted on social media over the weekend that he would only attend a Fox News debate on Sept. 4, though neither the Biden nor Harris campaigns ever agreed to attend a Fox debate.\n\n\"Kamala Harris doesn't have the mental capacity to do a REAL Debate against me, scheduled for September 4th in Pennsylvania,\" Trump posted. \"I'll see her on September 4th or, I won't see her at all.\"\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, California, in October 1964. She graduated from Howard University, a historically Black institution of higher education, in 1986 before receiving her law degree from the University of California in 1989.\n\nHarris worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, from 1990 until 1998. Her career as a prosecutor continued when she moved to the San Francisco District Attorney's office, where she worked as a managing attorney.\n\nShe spent time as the chief of the San Francisco City Attorney's Division on Children and Families and as the district attorney of San Francisco before California voters elected her attorney general in 2010.\n\nResidents in the Golden State then elected Harris to the U.S. Senate in 2016, where she stayed until she was sworn in as vice president in January 2021.\n\nHarris sought the Democratic presidential nomination during the 2020 primary, but dropped out two months before voting began.\n\nHarris is scheduled to give the convention keynote speech on Aug. 22, the final night of the gathering in Chicago. She'll likely be speaking to the largest audience she'll have in person and watching on television until election night.\n\nThat will provide a major opportunity for her to speak directly to the centrist and undecided voters who will determine the outcome of the November elections, including control of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.\n\nShould Harris win the Electoral College vote, she will become the country's first female president, the first president of South Asian descent and the second Black president when she's inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025.", "source": {"uri":

Ms Harris has conducted a fast search for a running mate and brought on a slate of new advisers to her campaign.\n\nTypically, candidates lock in the nomination at an in-person roll call vote held at the convention with much fanfare. But in 2024, the party held the unusual online vote to ensure it made state deadlines for printing ballots, it said.\n\nThe virtual roll call began Aug 1 morning. By Aug 2 afternoon, Harris - the only candidate on the ballot - had clinched a majority of the delegates she needed for the nomination. Voting concluded Aug 5 at 6pm local time (6am Singapore time on Aug 6). The party announced the results just before midnight.\n\nMs Harris first ran for president in 2019, while in her third year as a senator from California. In a crowded field of Democrats, she struggled to find her message, tangled with staff members and dropped out before voting began.\n\nNow, Ms Harris is setting out to prove she can lead a party desperate to block Trump's attempt to return to office.\n\nOn Aug 6, Ms Harris is expected to announce her running mate before holding a joint campaign rally in Philadelphia and then touring the battleground states.

Here's how the process worked", "body": "By ROBERT YOON - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic delegates have selected Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's presidential nominee, according to final vote results released late Monday by the Democratic National Committee. But don't expect a balloon drop just yet.\n\nHarris officially claimed the nomination following a five-day online voting process, receiving nearly 4,600 votes, which it said was 99% of participating delegates. The party did not release a precise number of votes that were cast for \"present\" or the state-by-state breakdown of \"present\" votes, though it did release state-by-state numbers for Harris.\n\nHarris had already secured the majority of votes needed to claim the nomination by Friday afternoon, DNC Chair Jaime Harrison announced in a live video presentation that day to mark the milestone, but the result was not official until after the voting period closed at 6 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead, they participated in what the party called a \"virtual roll call,\" filling out electronic ballots from their homes, offices or vacation spots more than two weeks before the first delegate steps foot inside Chicago's United Center.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.\n\nHow does the virtual process work?\n\nDelegates used an electronic voting method the party says is similar to one used to tally virtual roll call votes in the 2020 convention, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the party to conduct much of its official business remotely.\n\nUnder new procedures adopted by the convention's rules committee in late July, candidates had until Tuesday to declare their intent to seek the nomination and until that night to electronically submit the 300 delegate signatures required to qualify for the roll call vote. According to a DNC statement, Harris submitted signatures from 3,923 delegates, about 84% of the full delegation and 99% of delegates who signed a petition.\n\nUnder party rules, where only officially nominated candidates were eligible to receive votes, votes cast for someone other than Harris in the roll call were counted as \"present.\"\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAmong those eligible to vote were close to 4,000 pledged delegates selected through state primary and caucus processes as well as more than 700 others who have automatic delegate slots by virtue of the elected office or party positions they hold. These include Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives, former presidents and DNC members.\n\nThese automatic delegates, known informally as superdelegates, were the subject of much debate within the party for years because of their potential to influence the outcome of a close nomination fight despite not having been selected for their posts through a public process. Historically, however, superdelegates have never backed a candidate for the nomination other than the one who also earned the majority of pledged delegates.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, the party passed changes that allowed superdelegates to vote only on the second and subsequent ballots. Party rules do allow superdelegates to vote on the first ballot if a candidate has either won a majority of pledged delegates through the primary and caucus process, like President Joe Biden did, or submitted the signatures of a majority of total delegates, as Harris did.\n\nWhat about the nominee for vice president?\n\nNow that Harris is the Democratic presidential nominee, the new convention rules allow her to place the name of her pick for vice president into nomination, at which point the convention chair can declare that candidate as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris is closing in on selecting a running mate and spent the weekend interviewing possible candidates. She and whomever she selects will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, this week.\n\nWhy did this happen before the convention?\n\nDNC officials first indicated in May that they would conduct a virtual roll call to clear a potential hurdle in getting the Democratic nominee on the ballot in Ohio. Ohio's deadline to file for the general election ballot is Wednesday, two weeks before Democratic delegates would have crowned the nominee at the convention.\n\nAlthough the deadline had been modified in previous presidential election years to accommodate late-summer conventions of both parties, this year state Republicans initially planned to enforce the existing deadline, with one GOP lawmaker calling the scheduling bind \" a Democratic problem.\"\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature did eventually make the change at the behest of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31. Citing concerns that Ohio Republicans could still try to block their candidate from getting on the ballot despite the legislative fix, DNC officials moved forward with their virtual roll call as originally planned.\n\nSo what happens at the convention?\n\nThe main order of business at any national party convention is officially selecting nominees for president and vice president and for the nominees to deliver speeches accepting their nominations.\n\nTypically, the process of voting for the nominee is done publicly, with a live roll call vote in which state delegations cast their votes from the convention floor with much fanfare. This year's pre-convention vote for the Democratic nominee was conducted behind closed doors, with results released only at the conclusion of the vote, instead of the real-time vote updates that have been a fixture of past convention roll call votes.\n\nStill, in this year's virtual roll call, as with in-person roll calls going back decades, the outcome of the vote was essentially known long before the first vote was cast. Despite the period of uncertainty immediately following Biden's withdrawal from the race, an AP survey indicated that delegates overwhelmingly coalesced behind Harris to replace Biden on the ticket, leaving little suspense heading into the online vote.\n\nThe DNC says the convention will feature a ceremonial roll call vote, mimicking the look of a traditional convention roll call. Harris will still deliver an acceptance speech on the last day of the convention.\n\nIn addition to selecting presidential and vice presidential nominees, convention delegates participate in a variety of other business, including adopting the party's platform.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They say he should focus solely on the economy and immigration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, grappling with how to keep early 2024 Presidential election momentum alive, is also preparing for a crucial week.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week.

It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris.

It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris had surpassed the threshold of delegate support to become the party's presumptive nominee on Aug. 2 after already submitting more than 3,923 signatures by the day prior, Harrison said. Based on DNC rules passed in July, a candidate needs written support from at least 1,975 pledged delegates on the first ballot to become the presidential nominee.\n\nThe DNC began its virtual roll call of delegates on Aug. 1, more than two weeks ahead of it's national convention set for Aug. 19-22. The early vote was intended to meet ballot certification deadlines occurring in multiple states later this month. The virtual vote closed on Aug. 5.\n\nHarrison said the DNC will \"rally around Vice President Kamala Harris and demonstrate the strength of our party\" at the convention in Chicago.\n\nThe DNC formalized its rules for both the roll call and the 2024 convention on July 24. The virtual nominating process was similar to that used for the 2020 national convention, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis year, with no other candidate reaching the 300-delegate threshold required to challenge Harris, the party took action to nominate her before Ohio's ballot certification deadline, which was originally set for Aug. 7. Alabama's deadline was Aug. 15.\n\nBoth states passed measures to delay their deadlines, to Sept. 1 and Aug. 23, respectively. The DNC went ahead with an early roll call to prevent any legal challenges. Ballot certification deadlines in Montana, Oklahoma, Virginia, and California fall in the same week as the convention.\n\nHarris is expected to name a running mate ahead of a campaign stop in Philadelphia on Aug. 6. Her vice presidential shortlist includes Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n\"The power is with the people,\" Harris said during an Aug. 2 campaign livestream. \"We are going to win this election, and it is going to take all of us.\"\n\nHarris will be officially presented along with her chosen running mate at the party's convention in Chicago beginning Aug. 19.

Tim Walz as her running mate, AP sources say", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states, AP sources say.\n\nShe will introduce Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@bostonherald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Election_2024_Harris_Nomination_48075_5e74fa.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787379", "eventUri": "eng-9787379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The 81-year-old Biden's halting and stumbling delivery fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Biden's immediate backing of Harris ignited a surge of endorsements for the vice president by Democratic governors, senators, House members and other party leaders.

Trump.\n\nMs. Harris, 59, earned the support of 99 percent of the 4,567 delegates who cast ballots, the Democratic National Committee said in a statement late Monday. In an unusual move meant to avoid potential legal headaches, the roll call was held virtually over five days, instead of in-person at the Democratic National Convention, which begins on Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nThe convention's secretary, Jason Rae, must certify the results of the roll call before Ms. Harris and her soon-to-be-announced running mate accept the nomination.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has historic momentum at her back as we embark on the final steps in officially certifying her as our party's nominee,\" Jaime Harrison, the D.N.C. chair, and Minyon Moore, the convention chair, said in a statement.\n\nMs. Harris, whose mother was an immigrant from India and whose father is from Jamaica, would be the first Black woman and first person of South Asian heritage to hold the office. Ms. Harris landed at the top of her party's ticket after President Biden withdrew from the race on July 21 under pressure from his party and cleared a path for Ms. Harris's ascent.\n\nIn the two weeks since, the party has rushed to align behind her, retooled its message, raised millions and tried to harness a swell of enthusiasm for its new candidate. Ms. Harris has conducted a fast search for a running mate and brought on a slate of new advisers to her campaign.\n\nTypically, candidates lock in the nomination at an in-person roll call vote held at the convention with much fanfare. But this year, the party held the unusual online vote to ensure it made state deadlines for printing ballots, it said. The virtual roll call began Thursday morning. By Friday afternoon, Ms. Harris -- the only candidate on the ballot -- had clinched a majority of the delegates she needed for the nomination. Voting concluded on Monday at 6 p.m. The party announced the results just before midnight.\n\nMs. Harris first ran for president in 2019, while in her third year as a senator from California. In a crowded field of Democrats, she struggled to find her message, tangled with staff members and dropped out before voting began. Now Ms. Harris is setting out to prove she can lead a party desperate to block Mr. Trump's attempt to return to office.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Harris is expected to announce her running mate before holding a joint campaign rally in Philadelphia and then touring the battleground states.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_nehamas@nytimes.com", "name": "Nicholas Nehamas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_methods_in_deliberative_assemblies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voting methods in deliberative assemblies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Rae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyon_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minyon Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/multimedia/06pol-Harris-Nomination-vzck/06pol-Harris-Nomination-vzck-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787379", "eventUri": "eng-9787379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 574, "textEnd": 581}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 1277, "textEnd": 1284}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Her campaign raised $310 million in July, more than double the nearly $139 million that former President Donald Trump's campaign raised in the same time period.\n\nNo other Democrat challenged Harris for the nomination after Biden and the rest of the party leaders coalesced around her 2024 bid, deftly avoiding the unwanted brokered convention.\n\nOn Friday, Harris secured the necessary delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee after earning the majority of the convention delegates. The virtual roll call began Thursday at 9 a.m. ET but at 1:16 p.m. ET the next day the vice president had won 2,350 votes, cementing her status as the party's next leader.\n\nOnce a former San Francisco district attorney, Harris rose to become the state's attorney general before becoming the junior senator from California and then joining Biden's 2020 campaign as his running mate, making her the nation's highest-ranking woman politician when the pair were inaugurated in January 2021.\n\nHarris, who is black and Indian, became the second woman to lead a major-party ticket after Hillary Clinton accomplished the feat in 2016 before losing the election to Trump. She is also the second black person to lead a major-party ticket after former President Barack Obama became the nominee in 2008 and then again in 2012. Harris cinched the nomination 52 years after Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for the Democratic presidential nomination, launched her campaign.\n\nNormally, Harris would have secured the nomination during the Democratic National Convention scheduled to start Aug. 19 and go through Aug. 22 in Chicago.\n\nBut fearing complications from state ballot deadline certifications, Democrats continued with the virtual roll call before the convention commences. There is an expected ceremonial roll call that will take place in Chicago. Biden, once expected to be the crown jewel at the DNC, is scheduled to give the opening remarks on the first night of the convention.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe vice president is also weighing announcing her running mate, who will join her on a seven-state battleground tour beginning on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nShe spent the weekend interviewing candidates on the shortlist, including Govs. Andy Beshear (D-KY), J.B. Pritzker (D-IL), Josh Shapiro (D-PA), and Tim Walz (D-MN), as well as Sen.

This event eroded his supporters' confidence in his re-election bid and ignited significant internal conflict over whether he should continue his campaign.\n\nFollowing Biden's sudden withdrawal, Harris and her team swiftly garnered support from the 1,976 party delegates required for the nomination through a formal roll-call vote. She achieved this threshold rapidly, with an Associated Press survey indicating she had secured the necessary commitments just 32 hours post-Biden's announcement.\n\nHarris's nomination was confirmed following a five-day online voting session by Democratic National Convention delegates, concluding Monday night. The party announced shortly before midnight that 99% of the delegates who voted had chosen Harris. The early virtual roll call was planned to ensure Biden's presence on the ballot in every state. The party plans to formally certify the results before conducting a celebratory roll call at the convention in Chicago later this month.\n\nA poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, conducted after Biden's withdrawal, revealed that 46% of Americans view Harris favourably, while a similar percentage holds an unfavourable opinion. However, a greater number of Democrats expressed satisfaction with her candidacy than with Biden's, revitalizing a party that had been resigned to his nomination.", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "itishree_sethy@pragativadi.com", "name": "Itishree Sethy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://pragativadi.com/core/uploads/2022/03/gtaddeh8_kamala-harris-laughing-650_625x300_11_March_22.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787379", "eventUri": "eng-9787379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Throughout this digital assembly, over 4,000 delegates cast their votes, showing robust participation.\n\nKamala Harris quickly took a commanding lead, securing the majority of delegates on the first voting day.\n\nBy the end of this process, she had won the support of 99% of voters, totaling 3,923 votes -- a testament to her wide approval within the party.\n\nKamala Harris Clinches Democratic Nomination\n\nHarris's nomination breaks new ground in several ways.

She states, \"This campaign is about uniting people, driven by love for our country, to fight for our best qualities.\"\n\nKamala Harris has a history of breaking barriers. She has served as San Francisco's District Attorney, California's Attorney General, and the first Indian-American U.S. Senator.\n\nHer role as the U.S.'s first female Vice President of Black and South Asian descent further marks her pioneering career.\n\nNow, poised to potentially become the first woman and person of color as President, Kamala Harris continues to inspire a nation on the brink of transformative change.", "source": {"uri": "riotimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Rio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arkady_petrov@riotimesonline.com", "name": "Arkady Petrov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Americans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_District_Attorney's_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco District Attorney's Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.riotimesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kamala-Harris.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787379", "eventUri": "eng-9787379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 268}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

This strategy is similar to how then-candidate Joe Biden announced Harris as his vice-presidential pick during the 2020 election campaign.\n\nThis declaration comes as Harris takes the major role on the Democratic ticket as the party prepares for the November election against Republican Donald Trump.

However, a planned trip to Savannah, Georgia, has been postponed owing to the influence of Tropical Storm Debby, which may also impair their intended stop in Durham, North Carolina.

Edmund Muskie, former Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, California has been little more than a political moneybag, with candidates from both parties raising vast sums of campaign cash in homes and halls from San Francisco to BelAir, Brentwood, Newport Beach and San Diego.\n\nNot this time. If Harris - who has never overwhelmed voters within her own party or among the general California electorate - does not clinch the nomination on the August Democratic convention's first ballot, this state could gain immense new influence in picking the next nominee and possible next President.\n\nCalifornia will get 494 votes out of 4,223 to be cast on the first ballot at the Chicago convention. On that vote, party leaders and elected officials who are automatic delegates, AKA superdelegates, cannot vote. Still, Californians would cast more than 20 percent of the 2,112 votes needed for a first-ballot win.\n\nAdd in the state's 55 superdelegates, including mayors like Karen Bass of Los Angeles and state officials like Attorney General Rob Bonta, and California has 549 votes on any subsequent ballots, well over one-fifth of what's needed for nomination.\n\nWhich leaves two big questions for the next few weeks: Who might Harris choose for a running mate? And can she muster a clear majority of delegates previously committed to Biden and thus avoid a second ballot?\n\nIf Harris does not win on a first ballot, she would almost certainly be toast, with others like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly then emerging as possible contenders. One of them could be Harris' running mate, but that will not be Newsom, who hails not merely from the same state as Harris, but the same city. That's San Francisco, where Harris was district attorney and Newsom the mayor.\n\nA more important question might be this: Among this group, who might have the best chance of beating ex-President Donald Trump and his Republican running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance?\n\nFor sure, a debate or two between Harris and Trump would be very different from the Trump-Biden encounter of June 27, which eventually drove Biden into retirement.\n\nHarris, the former prosecutor, was known for her tough questions in Senate hearings. She would never let Trump escape unscathed with lies like his claim that some Democrat-run states allow babies to be killed just after their birth. That's murder everywhere.\n\nBut the impaired Biden did not respond at all to that claim, nor to Trump's 30-odd other lies during their debate.\n\nBut if Harris did take on a prosecutorial tone, would it appeal to voters?\n\nAnd how would Newsom, Whitmer, Pritzker or Kelly do running for President? Pritzker is known for his solid performance as governor and the billions of personal dollars he could kick in, while Newsom has gotten both criticism and praise for some of his moves, like quick Covid lockdowns and what amounts to deficit financing of the state budget. He also gets blamed by Republicans whenever businesses leave for lower-tax states like Texas and Florida.\n\nA wild card in some lists of potential candidates is Kelly, husband of Gabby Giffords, herself an assassination target who suffered far more serious damage from her shooting than Trump's spectacularly bloodied ear. A former astronaut, Kelly also carries some of the celebrity status that helps propel Trump.\n\nBut California's clout will rest on delegation unity. The person most influential in choosing the state's delegates was Newsom. If he honors his pledge never to oppose Harris, he might be able both to hold the delegation together behind her and her vice presidential pick or to solidify them behind him if Harris drops out after a potential first-ballot failure.\n\nOne thing for sure: The more doubt remaining about the Democratic choice as the campaign enters August, the greater California's influence could be - putting this state in a position many here have long coveted.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.

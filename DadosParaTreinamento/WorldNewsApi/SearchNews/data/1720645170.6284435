Porzingis, playing in his first game in 38 days due to a soleus strain, erupted for 20 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 blocks in the Celtics\u2019 107-89 Game 1 triumph over the Mavericks. He hit 8 of 13 shots, 2 of 4 3-pointers, and both free throws, electrifying the crowd in the first quarter and finishing plus-13 on the night. It was easy to see how much joy the experience brought the Celtics big man, both during and after the game. As of Saturday morning, it was clear the excitement still hadn\u2019t worn off. Porzingis posted a photo of himself saluting the TD Garden crowd, with the caption: \u201cFeels great to be back. Thankful for the support! We have a lot more work to do,\u201d with a shamrock. Porzingis told reporters that walking out from the tunnel and onto the court felt like a World Wrestling Entertainment experience. On the court, he surprised even himself. \u201cI don\u2019t think even I expected to be moving so well,\u201d Porzingis told reporters. Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla has a decision heading into Game 2 on Sunday \u2013 whether to stick with veteran Al Horford in the starting lineup or pivot back to Porzingis. Porzingis looked healthy and mobile on both ends, and has three days between games, so the decision will likely boil down to strategy more than availability. Tip-off is set for 8 p.m. The Celtics are 1-2 in Game 2s this postseason and 12-0 in all other games. The Mavericks are 3-0 in Game 2s and 9-6 in all other games.", "summary": "<p>\"We have a lot more work to do.\"</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/06/08/kristaps-porzingis-thanks-fans-celtics-mavericks-nba-finals/\">&#8216;Feels great to be back&#8217;: Kristaps Porzingis thanks Celtics fans</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/06/08/kristaps-porzingis-thanks-fans-celtics-mavericks-nba-finals/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kristaps-Porzingis-666487220e182-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:11:13", "author": "Trevor Hass", "authors": ["Trevor Hass"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.084}

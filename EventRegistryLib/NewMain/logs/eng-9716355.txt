Actress Seemingly Comes Out In Viral TikTok Video", "body": "Julia Fox has called herself a lesbian in response to a viral TikTok trend after hinting at her sexuality in an earlier interview.\n\nSorry, boys, but Julia Fox might just be out of your league now. The actress has seemingly come out as a lesbian in a TikTok video, which is now going viral on the platform and has garnered hundreds of comments.\n\nWhile Julia Fox had earlier hinted at her sexuality in an interview in 2022, it does come as a surprise to many as she was previously married to Peter Artemiev and later had an affair with Kanye West.\n\nFox posted a video on TikTok on July 8th in response to a viral trend. The original video was posted by user @emgwaciedawgie, who said, \"I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It's like 'Aww, you hate that man. You literally hate him.'\" Fox stitched the video with her own response and said, \"Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Won't happen again.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old actress did not post any caption with the video, but fans are now certain that Fox has indeed come out as a lesbian. The video was flooded with comments from fans, who called her an 'icon' and a 'queen' for being true to herself.\n\nIn an interview with Ziwe in 2022, the host asked Fox if she had ever tried dating women, to which the actress replied, \"I, like, have been thinking about it a lot recently,\" adding, \"Because I do think I have a gay bone, and I need to explore that a little bit more. Like, maybe my ex-boyfriends weren't wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them.\"\n\nFox was married to pilot Peter Artemiev from 2018 to 2022 and shares a three-year-old son, Valentino, with him. In 2022, she made headlines for her fling with Kanye West; however, the actress later revealed that their relationship was not at all sexual. In May this year, Fox disclosed that she had been celibate for 2.5 years, as she thinks \"nothing good comes from having sex.\"", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Koimoi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jashandeep_singh@koimoi.com", "name": "Jashandeep Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Fox_(author)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julia Fox (author)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ziwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Lesbian", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Lesbian", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Family_and_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Family and Relationships", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://static-koimoi.akamaized.net/wp-content/new-galleries/2024/07/is-julia-fox-a-lesbian-actress-seemingly-comes-out-in-viral-tiktok-video-01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716355", "eventUri": "eng-9716355", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 579, "textEnd": 587}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

No, I'm just kidding,\" the actress quipped during a Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen appearance back in May. \"I think with the overturning of Roe v. Wade and our rights being stripped away from us, this is a way that I can take back the control. And it just sucks that it has to be in that way, but I just don't feel comfortable until things change.\"\n\nFox said she didn't have end date in mind, noting that she surprised herself with her lengthy abstinence.\n\n\"It was six months and then it was a year and then I'm like, 'Oh my god, it's almost two and a half years and it's still going,'\" she added.\n\nWhen Cohen asked if she \"missed\" sex, she admitted, \"No. In the beginning, yes, but I think it's just like getting over anything, smoking, drugs, whatever it may be. Eventually you just forget and all that energy you were putting toward sex you can put toward other things.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJulia Fox Explains Celibacy, What Needs to Change for Her to Go Back\n\nJulia Fox Says She Did Not Have Sex With Kanye West While Dating", "source": {"uri": "wkyc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wkyc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ziwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Contact her at DearShonVogue@gmail.com for your own chance at enlightenment.\n\nI came out as bisexual when I was sixteen. I dated a nonbinary person in college then after we broke up they came out as a trans man which sent me into a sexuality crisis.\n\nI ended up deciding to use the terms \"gay\" and \"queer\" to describe myself. When using the former it irked me when people assumed I meant I was a lesbian (if I meant lesbian, I would say lesbian). The latter allowed me more flexibility to describe the complexity of my sexuality.\n\nRecently, though, I've been questioning my identity. I've always thought that, even if I liked a man, I wouldn't want to pursue a relationship with one. In recent years, I've seen \"lesbian\" being used by women and non-binary folks alike with the description of being attracted to non-men. I currently have a girlfriend who I hope to be with for the remainder of my days, and I find myself making lesbian jokes more than I did before.\n\nAll this led me to reading parts of the infamous Am I a Lesbian? masterdoc, which really spoke to me. Learning about compulsory heterosexuality made me question if any of the crushes I have had on men have been genuine. Then, after reading this doc, I had a horrible thought that reduced me to tears: If I am a lesbian, that would mean I'm truly broken.\n\nIt seems I have internalized homophobia, but I don't know why I have this hang-up with \"lesbian\" when I refer to myself as being gay. I'm also aware that this appears to be a wider issue -- the terms \"sapphic,\" \"wlw,\" \"queer women,\" and even the reclaimed slur \"dyke\" appear to be used more often than \"lesbian.\" It could be down to lack of positive representation, but I don't even really know how to describe the way referring to myself as a lesbian makes me feel apart from, to use its other definition -- it makes me feel a bit queer.", "source": {"uri": "vogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trans man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bisexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compulsory heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology_of_homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terminology of homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyke_(slang)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyke (slang)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/66872c9ee838dabb00bb0f9e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/MCDKIJE_FE002.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716355", "eventUri": "eng-9716355", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The model, who rose to fame for her whirlwind relationship with rapper Kanye West, recently made a shocking confession about her sexuality. However, Fox, who has publicly dated men in the past, had some words for her exes, including the Yeezy founder.\n\nThe Uncut Gems star came out as a lesbian in a TikTok video. Her revelation came as a response to a viral TikTok trend from user @emgwaciedawgie. \"I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It's like, 'Aww, you hate that man. You literally hate him,\" the original clip says. Fox seemed to agree with the sentiment and stitched the video. While enjoying an afternoon stroll in a grey tank top, the Internet personality cheekily revealed:\n\nHey. That was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry boys. Won't happen again.\n\nFox's post immediately received over 20,000 likes, with fans expressing their adoration for her response. One elated fan wondered, \"Did the iconic Julia Fox come out lesbian? Another comment read, \"Love you, Julia. We're so happy to have you.\" Other fans revealed that they knew all along. \"After reading your book I was just waiting on the coming out,\" a third fan admitted, while a fourth follower penned, \"Wait, I'm listening to ur book rn, okay, this makes sense.\"\n\nThis isn't Fox's first time discussing her true sexuality. In a 2022 interview, she opened up about the possibility of dating women. \"Like, maybe my ex-boyfriends weren't wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them,\" she said on Ziwe.\n\nHowever, while Fox boldly identifies as a lesbian, she has had her fair share of Hollywood hunks. Her most famous relationship with Kanye lasted for just two months in 2022. The romance happened shortly after the rapper's divorce from ex Kim Kardashian was finalized. Fox has also had a short fling with rapper Drake. Before her time with the Canadian artist, Elle Magazine reports that Fox was married to Peter Artemiev, a private pilot from Brooklyn.

It started when TikTok user @emgwaciedawgie (Gracin, a comedian) said in a recent post, \"I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It's like, Aw, you hate that man. You literally hate him.\" Gracin went on to describe a relationship in which a woman seems to \"literally despise\" her male partner.\n\nThen, on July 8, Fox stitched the video with a walk-and-talk reply of her own -- and clearly, the message resonated with her.\n\n\"Hey, that was me,\" Fox says in her 16-second clip. \"I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Um, won't happen again.\"\n\nAs the original poster wrote in a follow-up, \"did i just facilitate julia fox coming out\" -- celebrating the occasion by writing \"ily queen\" in the caption.\n\nFans took to the comments to send their love, too. \"So proud of you,\" wrote one user; \"The icon that you are,\" said another.\n\nIf you've been keeping up with Fox, you know that this isn't the first time she has been candid about her sexuality.

Wade and our rights being stripped away from us, this is a way that I can take back the control,\" she told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live. \"And it just sucks that it has to be in that way, but I just don't feel comfortable until things change.\"\n\nEven before coming out as lesbian, Fox was a vocal LGBTQ+ ally. She's sported matching \"Gay Ally\" T-shirts with her son, and voiced her support for trans communities in a 2023 interview with Gay Times.\n\n\"As a cis woman, I feel like it's absolutely my duty to empower and uplift trans voices and try to get people to understand that, trans, nonbinary or queer, at the end of the day, we are all human,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bustle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ziwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Fox later revealed that she and Kanye had never had sex, and Julia later let the world know (via a social media comment) that she'd been celibate for 2.5 years (\"and never been better tbh\"), which encompasses the time that their relationship would have been going and tracks with her previous claim that the two had never had sex.\n\nFox is now back with another (friendly) clap back to another social media post, and her reaction appears to be telling. This episode begins with TikTok user @emgwaciedawgie's viral TikTok video, which includes this sentiment: \"I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It's like 'Aww, you hate that man.'\" In response, Julia posted a video while strolling down the street: \"Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry boys. Won't happen again.\"\n\nIn 2020, Fox filed for divorce from Peter Artemiev, to whom she was married for two years.

It's like, 'Aww, you hate that man. You literally hate him.'\"\n\nFox stitched the post and replied, \"Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Won't happen again.\"\n\nIn the video post, Fox can be seen walking along a busy street while donning a sunshade that protected her eyes from the sun and left her hair unpacked.\n\nFox's confession may not come as a surprise to many, as she previously discussed the prospects of dating a woman during a 2022 interview with Ziwe.\n\n\"I have some gay bone [in my body], and I need to explore that a little bit more,\" Fox told the host. \"Like, maybe my ex-boyfriends weren't wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them.\"\n\nFox's truth comes after she also shared in a TikTok video that she'd not had sexual intercourse in over two years, gushing on about how good it feels for her.\n\nAt the time, she responded to photos of a controversial billboard ad from the popular dating app Bumble that read, \"A vow of celibacy is not the answer.\"\n\nThe controversial billboard post garnered uproar from fans, who slammed Bumble for such kind of post.\n\n\"Imagine pretending to be a dating app for women and launching a million-dollar ad campaign blaming women for a very normal reaction to men's violence,\" the caption over the video read.\n\nIn her response to the TikTok post, Fox wrote, \"2.5 years of celibacy and never been better.\"\n\nThe \"No Sudden Move\" actress shares her 3-year-old son, Valentino, with her ex-husband Peter Artemiev, whom she married from 2018 to 2020.\n\nShe briefly dated controversial rapper Kanye West in the latter part of 2022, during his divorce from ex-wife Kim Kardashian. However, during an interview with The New York Times, she explained that they did not have sex when they were together.\n\n\"Because there, like, wasn't any,\" Fox replied when asked about her sexual encounters with the \"Donda\" rapper. \"It wasn't really about that.\"\n\nDuring a conversation with Stellar Magazine, the \"Uncut Gems\" star lamented how her relationship with the \"Vultures\" rapper left her wounded and said that she wouldn't make it a point to date another celebrity so openly.\n\nFox seemingly insinuated that she's not looking to get into a relationship anytime soon, claiming men are \"an obstacle I have to get through.\"\n\n\"What I find happens so often in public relationships - at least what happened to me, and maybe I'm just scarred from it - is that you become known as that person's girlfriend,\" the 34-year-old actress said.\n\nShe went on, \"And I just don't want to uphold that. I want to be able to make it on my own. I don't want anyone to be able to attribute my success to a man in my life.\"\n\n\"If anything, men are an obstacle I have to get through. It has never helped me,\" Fox added, per the Daily Mail.\n\nFox appeared on \"Watch What Happens Live!\" with Andy Cohen, where she opened up on her reason for staying celibate.\n\nThe fashionista wore a see-through dress that appeared to be made of cellophane over a black bra, panties, and thick-heeled black boots to complete the look.\n\nCohen read a fan question asking, \"What's your reasoning behind being celibate, and in what ways do you believe it has improved your life?\"\n\nTo which she replied, \"Well, I just think nothing good comes from having sex, including children,\" before adding that she was \"just kidding!\"\n\n\"I think with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and you know, our rights being stripped away from us, this is a way that I can take back control,\" she explained. \"And it just sucks that it has to be in that way, but I just don't feel comfortable until things change.\"\n\nFox's lighthearted approach to sharing her truth sparked a flurry of support and celebration from her followers, who took to the comment section to share their replies.\n\nA fan wrote, \"LOVE YOU, JULIA. WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU,\" while another said, \"Omg, yes, mother!! I've been waiting for this. I'm so proud of you.\"\n\n\"Been waiting for this since I finished [your] book,\" another fan noted.\n\nOne curious individual wanted to know if Fox's admission about her sexuality changed her celibate status.\n\nThey asked, \"So when you say you're 'celibate,' do you just mean you've not had sex with a man? But you've done so with your partner, right?\"\n\nAnother fan commented, \"After your memoir, I saw this coming, and I just want to say how happy I am for you.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "favour_adegoke@theblast.com", "name": "Favour Adegoke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncut_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncut (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tongue-in-cheek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(religion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confession (religion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ziwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Sudden_Move", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No Sudden Move"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imagine (John Lennon song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_(fashion_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valentino (fashion designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual intercourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

You actually despise him.\"\n\nAdmitting, \"Hey, that was me,\" Fox spliced the video with her own message. I became that lesbian. I apologies, lads.

Fox has Artemiev's 3-year-old son Valentino.\n\nFox said, \"maybe my ex-boyfriends were wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them,\" during a 2022 interview on \"Ziwe,\" mentioning she has been considering dating women.\n\nFox also said earlier this year that she had been celibate for more than two and a half years and that she and West had not been intimate throughout their brief romance.\n\nShe remarked on \"Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\" in May, \"I just think nothing good comes from having sex, including children.\" No, I'm just kidding. With Roe v. Wade overturned, she said abstaining from sex was a means of regaining control.\n\nFox noted she was taken aback by her celibacy's length and that she had no idea of a termination date for it. \"Oh my god, it's almost two and a half years and it's still going.'\" Six months then, then a year.\n\nWhen Cohen inquired about missing sex, she said, \"No. Yes, in the beginning, but I believe it's only like overcoming anything, smoking, drugs, whatever it may be. Eventually you simply forget and all that energy you were devoting to sex may be directed toward other pursuits.\"\n\n\u00c2", "source": {"uri": "indiaglitz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaGlitz.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Fox_(author)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julia Fox (author)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ziwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abstinence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abstinence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

When it comes to major life accomplishments, I've always been a late bloomer. I was late to lesbian life and gay girl dating. But when I came out, it was a fresh start and I was full of faith and hope that I would find love. It has been quite an adventure coming out later in life. I want to share a little about my own coming-out story and a very big \"ah-ha\" moment that changed my approach to \"being out.\" I always knew I was attracted to girls but was never able to make a love connection with a girl. Finally, I decided I could and would make it work with a guy.\n\nLet me also include the fact that I grew up in an Irish-Catholic family with all the assorted craziness of alcoholism, abuse, and neglect that you've read about in epic Irish tales like Frank McCourt's book, Angela's Ashes. I felt like I finally understood so much about my father when I read that book. That's another story, but you get my whole \"Irish-Catholic guilt, God is a mean man with a big stick and I'm a bad girl\" story. Enough said.\n\nRELATED: I Discovered I Was Bisexual At Girl Scout Camp\n\nCompared to friends, I married late, at 26 years old. I also had kids late in the game at 27 and 38 years old. I started college right out of high school but didn't have the emotional stamina or a personal vision to help me see it as something I should stick with at that time in my life.\n\nI quit after a couple of years and focused on \"doing what I want.\" Going back to school at 40 years old to finish up my Bachelor's degree isn't so unusual these days. I'm glad I finally did it. It changed the entire direction of my professional and personal life. How's that? While finishing college in my 40s, I started to meet some amazing lesbians and I could no longer deny who and what I was.\n\nI was also finally in a position where I realized that I would be able to support myself and my young daughter on my own. Not being able to support my kids on my own was honestly something that had scared me for a long time and had kept me married. All of this is to make the simple point and to say that we all have our coming out stories, and then we have our \"being out\" story -- that particularly sweet and often bitter period when we are first exploring what it means to date women, love women and make love to women. If you're seeing a really good therapist, she is telling you things like go slow in dating lesbians, don't change what doesn't need to be changed in this period, important dating tips, and the big one: you're like a 14-year-old learning to date gay girls.\n\nIt took me getting to therapist number three to get this important bit of information. I was shocked, to say the least. \"Wow, you're kidding,\" I thought. I'm over 40. Yikes! Fourteen in lesbian years sounded awful. This meant I was still way behind the curve, terribly immature, and with all kinds of pent-up feelings and desires\n\nHow was I ever going to conquer lesbian dating? How can this be? Well it is this way, isn't it? This is a hard lesson for late-comers to the \"gay girl party.\" You can't fake the experiences you haven't had. Sure you can try, but often we stink at it, or let me say, I stunk at it. Holy cow, I sure did. You know the story about learning to ride a bike: You never forget. You might need to work on balance if you hop on a bike after not riding for many years, but the mechanics of it come back immediately. Your muscles and your brain neurons remember and fire off the commands you need to get the bike moving.\n\nRELATED: My Parenting Style Changed Dramatically After I Came Out As Gay\n\nWell, if your dating experience includes only guys, guess what? You have no muscles or neurons that know how to date gay women. You're going to have to grow those neurons and develop those muscles, and it's gonna get messy now and again. Guys are pretty simple creatures when you compare them to women. The amount of drama I created for myself was astounding because I didn't understand this whole repeating adolescence piece. I hated my early teen years. I hated the sense of awkwardness and not knowing how to relate to the boys I wanted to date or the girls I wanted to kiss. I hated the competition to be liked and be part of the \"cool clique.\" I hated not knowing what to wear or how to fix my hair.\n\nMy early school years were spent at Catholic schools wearing uniforms. Then, in middle school, I had to wear \"regular\" clothes every day. And what does a lesbian wear? I know I swung through all those old adolescent fears in my first few years of being out. Some of my feeling crazy in those first years out was my own doing. My excitement at coming out later in life, finally dating women, having an intimate relationship, and being visible in the lesbian community meant that I made some pretty poor choices. I also made some great choices and had some amazing experiences. Everything was new and I was letting myself feel things I'd been denying myself for years.\n\nI loved going to the local lesbian bar. It was a seedy little place with a pool table, an outdoor smoking area with a large dead tree in the middle of it, and the tiniest bathroom stalls you've ever tried to squat in. But it was the only place in the city that was strictly for gay girls. Nirvana! At least for a little while. Just openly watching women was exciting. Come on, you do remember that, right? Especially when it was a room full of gay girls dancing, mingling, and romancing. That's part of the adolescent experience.\n\nRELATED: 26 Lessons Learned In 26 Years Of Being Out\n\nI was clueless about all the drama that was being played out all around me at the time. I was totally in the high of finally being out and open in this environment. It felt amazing. Along with the bar scene and trying to figure out how to pick up women, I was also living on my own with my daughter. I moved out of the house I owned with my husband at the time. I didn't want it. I felt myself drowning in that married with children life and all I wanted was to be free, to live honestly and openly as a lesbian, and to raise my daughter as my true self. My son was almost done with high school and decided to stay with his dad.\n\nThe good of being openly lesbian had some pretty tough and painful lessons attached to it, and my relationship with my son was one of them. The adolescent lesbian in me held on to the excitement of this new life, but the mom in me had a lot of heartbreak about my son and his reactions to my coming out and leaving his dad.\n\nI'm grateful that he and I have patched up our relationship over the years. Oh, I should also say that I did the leaving part while not being in a committed relationship with a woman. Now, that first relationship came pretty quickly, but my decision to leave my marriage was based on coming out to myself and deciding that I could no longer deny who I was.\n\nRepeating my adolescence as a lesbian included learning how to live and relate as a lesbian in a relationship. It was tough, confusing, and a mix of sweet and sour. Women who come out in their youth often have little patience for women who come out later in life. I can respect that now that I've become a little older in lesbian years. This adolescent thing we go through is important stuff to understand. I feel like I'm finally on the other side of it after 10 years of being out. That would make me about 25 in lesbian years.

(\"Stitches\" allow people to add to or offer rebuttals to existing videos)\n\nThe original video showed TikTok denizen @emgwaciedawgie saying: \"I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It's like 'Aww, you hate that man. You literally hate him.'\"\n\nThat commentary referred to closeted lesbians or lesbians who may be in denial about their sexuality. In our deeply homophobic society, it is very normal for people to attempt going through the motions of cishet compliance before feeling free to be themselves.\n\nIn Julia Fox's stitched response, she faces the camera and says: \"Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Won't happen again.\"\n\nObviously, she does not owe anyone an apology. The social pressures to feign heterosexuality cause many people to date without attraction -- and she may have earnestly not realized that she was not attracted to men.\n\nThe funny part of this is the implication that she loathed Kanye West. It doesn't excuse dating him, but it is funny.\n\nThough Julia Fox infamously dated Kanye West (for less than two months, in 2022) and was actually married to Peter Artemiev from 2018 to 2020, she has spoken about wanting to date women.\n\nDuring a 2022 interview with Ziwe, she noted: \"I have some gay bone [in my body] and I need to explore that a little bit more.\"\n\nAt the time, Fox added: \"Like, maybe my ex-boyfriends weren't wrong when they were calling me a 'lesbian' and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them.\"\n\nAs we previously reported, Julia Fox announced in 2023 that she never boned Kanye West during their brief, ill-advised entanglement.\n\n\"It wasn't really about that,\" she characterized at the time.\n\nIndeed, many suspected that Kanye was using Julia Fox to get back at Kim, while she was using Ye for attention.\n\n\"2.5 years of celibacy and never been better tbh,\" she announced in May on a separate TikTok video.\n\nNot everyone desires sex. Sometimes it's about the effort not being worth it, about a lack of sexual attraction (the asexual community exists!), or personal or religious restrictions. It can even be about safety.\n\nOf course, it can also be about believing that you don't enjoy sex simply because you're still figuring yourself out. While Julia Fox can absolutely come out as a lesbian without having sex to \"prove\" it, her coming out could also signal plans to break that celibacy streak. If so, we have a sneaking suspicion that she'll share the news.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_delott@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Simon Delott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Fox_(author)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julia Fox (author)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeted", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closeted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peer pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual attraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asexuality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0709_juliafox_header-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716355", "eventUri": "eng-9716355", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 380, "textEnd": 386}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Fox has a 3-year-old son, Valentino, with Artemiev.\n\nDuring her 2022 appearance on Ziwe, she shared that she'd recently been considering dating women.\n\n\"Like, maybe my ex-boyfriends weren't wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them,\" she shared.\n\nFox also shared earlier this year that she's been celibate for over two and a half years -- having previously admitted that she and West weren't intimate during their brief relationship.\n\n\"I just think nothing good comes from having sex, including children. No, I'm just kidding,\" the actress quipped during a Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen appearance back in May. \"I think with the overturning of Roe v. Wade and our rights being stripped away from us, this is a way that I can take back the control. And it just sucks that it has to be in that way, but I just don't feel comfortable until things change.\"\n\nFox said she didn't have end date in mind, noting that she surprised herself with her lengthy abstinence.\n\n\"It was six months and then it was a year and then I'm like, 'Oh my god, it's almost two and a half years and it's still going,'\" she added.\n\nWhen Cohen asked if she \"missed\" sex, she admitted, \"No. In the beginning, yes, but I think it's just like getting over anything, smoking, drugs, whatever it may be.

I was that lesbian,\" the Uncut Gems lead said.\n\nThe fashion icon, who was previously married to Peter Artemiev before being swept into a romance with Kanye West in 2022, then apologized to her male exes. \"So sorry, boys. Won't happen again,\" Fox admitted.\n\nIn 2020, Fox and Artemiev finalized their divorce after about two years of marriage. The former duo welcomed their three-year-old son Valentino in January of 2021. About a year later, the OMG Fashun host was spotted gallivanting about with the Donda artist, being photographed in matching styles outside high profile fashion shows.\n\nFox detailed her short relationship with West in her memoir Down the Drain. According to the actress, their romance was unexpected. West had supposedly asked for her number from an old friend of hers. A simple introduction text turned into never-ending conversations and late-night phone calls. When they finally found themselves face-to-face for the first time in Miami for New Year's Eve, the rapper asked if Fox wanted to be his girlfriend.\n\n\"He very bluntly asks me: 'Would you want to be my girlfriend?'\" Fox wrote. \"I instantly burst out laughing. He can't be serious. A photographer circles the table, snapping candid photos of us midsentence. He follows up with: 'How would you feel about taking our relationship public?'\"\n\nWest's hasty proposition was followed by a short-lived relationship, which according to Fox, didn't have much of a honeymoon period. Since then, Fox has kept to herself, prioritizing her career, her son, and her dedication to supporting women's abortion rights.\n\nIn fact, for the past two years Fox has been celibate. During a recent interview on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the movie star confessed she didn't mean to be celibate for so long, but she had no plans to quit the abstinence anytime soon.\n\n\"I just think nothing good comes from having sex,\" Fox told Cohen, admitting \"having children\" is a blessing. Now, she said her celibacy has also become a power protest.\n\nFox said: \"I think with the overturning of Roe v Wade and our rights being stripped away from us, this is a way that I can take back the control. And it just sucks that it has to be in that way, but I just don't feel comfortable until things change.\"\n\nBut while the on-screen star is fully committed to her celibacy, she wasn't anitcipating it to last as long as it has at the start. \"It was six months, and then it was a year, and then I'm like: 'Oh my god, it's almost two and a half years and it's still going,'\" she confessed.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncut_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncut (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeymoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honeymoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Won't happen again.\"\n\nFox, who has always been 'New York famous', shot to international fame after dating Kanye West shortly after his divorce from Kim Kardashian.\n\nFans were surprised by Fox's 'coming out', with commenters asking her to clarify. However, this isn't the first time Julia has spoken about her sexuality -- and that she's not dating men.\n\nIn 2022, she told ELLE US she was done with men, taking issue with toxic masculinity, abuse and entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like knowingly engaging in a heterosexual relationship, you are signing yourself up for an unhealthy dynamic,\" she said. \"I want to be left alone. Like, don't talk to me, don't look at me, don't bother me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, also in 2022, Fox told media figure Ziwe that she had a \"gay bone\".\n\n\"I, like, have been thinking about it a lot recently. Because I do think maybe I have some, you know -- I have a gay bone and I need to explore that a little bit more,\" she said. \"Like maybe my ex-boyfriends weren't wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them.\"\n\nFox has often spoken honestly about her sexuality, including when she commented on a recent TikTok saying she was \"2.5 years of celibacy and never been better tbh.\"\n\nLast year, Julia Fox published her first memoir, Down The Drain, in which she spoke about her past relationships, childhood drug use, abuse and working as a dominatrix when she was completing high school.\n\nIn the book, she claims a former lover she dubbed 'The Artist' -- which many concluded to be Kanye West -- heavily controlled everything she wore, and offered her a 'boob job'.\n\nIn one scenario, she says The Artist interrupted their third date by taking Fox to the restaurant bathroom, where he'd had a stylist meet them and lay out a new selection of outfits for Fox to wear.\n\nAs for who Fox is dating now, that is unclear. But we hope any new revelations about her dating life continue to roll-out as spur-of-the-moment TikTok interactions.", "source": {"uri": "elle.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_mitchell@elle.com.au", "name": "Rebecca Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ziwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxic masculinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominatrix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/07/julia-fox-sexuality-1-1200x630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716355", "eventUri": "eng-9716355", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It's like, Aw, you hate that man. You literally hate him.'\n\nFox responded to this with her own TikTok video on July 8, sharing her personal connection to the sentiment.\n\nIn the brief clip she says: 'Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Um, won't happen again.' Fans quickly flooded the comments with messages of support.\n\nThe original poster than captioned a follow up post: 'Did i just facilitate julia fox coming out? ily queen.'\n\nFox has never shied away from discussing her sexuality. During a 2022 appearance on the talk show Ziwe, she revealed her curiosity about dating women, a curiosity she has now seemingly explored.\n\n'Like, maybe my ex-boyfriends weren't wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them,' she mused at the time.\n\nHer candid reflections have continued to draw attention, particularly her decision to remain celibate for over two years in response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the law that made abortion a federal right in the United States.\n\n'With the overturning of Roe v. Wade and our rights being stripped away from us, this is a way that I can take back the control,' she told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live.\n\nGiven that Fox's most high profile relationship was with Kanye West, its difficult not to take the TikTok as a subtle dig at him.\n\nShe was in a relationship with the rapper in early 2022 and their romance captured a ton of media attention despite only lasting a few weeks.\n\nDespite the breakup, Fox remained in the public eye, often discussing her experiences and continuing her career in fashion and acting.t\n\nShe also previously said that dating the rapper 'left a sour taste in her mouth.'\n\nShe said: 'Dating that man for a month -- one month. That's why I have such a sour taste in my mouth about dating anyone in this sphere because I don't ever want to just be known as someone's girlfriend.'\n\nShe continued, telling InStyle magazine: 'I know I'm so much more than that and I feel like that happens so much to women in this industry. They're only as good as their partner or they can make a whole career off being some guy's partner but regardless, either way, it becomes their identity.'\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_ivey_johnson@metro.co.uk", "name": "Brooke Ivey Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

On July 8, the Uncut Gems actor, who briefly dated Kanye West in 2022, duetted a video about lesbians who hate their boyfriends, and she felt *seen* by the TikTok clip.\n\n\"I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It's like, 'Ah, you hate that man. You literally hate him,'\" the original creator, Emily Gracin, said in a video posted July 8. That same day, Fox added her own two cents to the TikTok, \"Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Won't happen again.\"\n\nSince Fox posted, the video has gained over 43,000 likes, with plenty of comments cheering her on. \"julia fox lesbian content is like my exact fyp,\" one fan wrote. \"After reading ur book I immediately knew queen,\" another commented. \"The 'won't happen again' was so perfect and so final,\" another account responded. Fox liked all of their comments.\n\nGracin -- the creator of the initial video -- reposted Fox's duet, adding in, \"did i just facilitate julia fox coming out.\"\n\nIn December 2023 interview, Fox hinted at being more receptive to female attention during a conversation with Charli XCX for Interview Magazine. \"I've been told that I'm a sex symbol for women. That's the best compliment I could ever receive in life. Because prior to that, it was very much giving bombshell,\" Fox said at the time.\n\n\"If girls want to fantasize about me and it makes them happy, I am so for it. I'd rather have a bunch of girls fantasizing about me than a bunch of dudes jerking off to my photos. I don't want that energy. I don't want any boners in my direction. Ew,\" she added.\n\nPreviously, Fox shared that her extremely public relationship with West wasn't about sex. She told The New York Times in September 2023 that she didn't include sex stories about West in her Down The Drain memoir for good reason.\n\nBack in a September 2023 interview with The New York Times, Fox explained why her book was lacking sex quotes about Kanye West. \"Because there, like, wasn't any.

The Down the Drain author, 34, didn't provide many details, but she responded to a humorous clip of a creator talking about seeing women being mean to their boyfriends. Julia also appeared to explain that she doesn't plan to date men again.\n\nThe original clip was made by a creator with the handle @emgwaciedawgie, and it's received over 600,000 views. \"I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It's like 'ah, you hate that man,'\" the original TikToker said in the clip.\n\nThe video then cut to a stitch of Julia. She filmed it close to her face, while walking down the street. She rocked a huge pair of sunglasses, and her blonde look was seen behind her. She showed that she related to the video. \"Hey, that was me! I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Won't happen again,\" she said.\n\nWhile Julia's new video seems to be her coming out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, she's previously been in relationships with men. Her first husband was Peter Artemiev, whom she shares her son with. She also notably dated Kanye West for a brief time in 2022.\n\nEven though the new video seemed to be Julia's coming out, she has not shied away from discussing sex or her sexuality in the past. Back in May, she revealed that she had been celibate for two and a half years, following her and Ye's breakup.\n\nBesides her celibacy, she's been very open about her past career as a dominatrix before breaking into the acting world. In fact, she credited that line of work with helping her learn the ins and outs of acting during an appearance on The View in October 2023. \"A lot of it is role-play. A lot of it is cosplay,\" she said. \"That's where I learned to act. Let's say I have five clients in a day, and each one of them wants something different. One wants the mean, popular girl in school. One wants a nun. One wants a neglectful mother.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_crowley@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "James Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celibacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominatrix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cosplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2157754200-e1720529600260.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716355", "eventUri": "eng-9716355", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 85, "textEnd": 91}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The announcement came in response to comedian Emily Gracin's TikTok video about seeing \"a lesbian with their boyfriend.\" Fox humorously replied to the video saying, \"Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian,\" and playfully apologized to her exes by stating, \"So sorry, boys. Won't happen again.\"\n\nBefore coming out, Fox had been involved with men, including a marriage to a New York-based private pilot Peter Artemiev in 2018. The couple shares a three-year-old son named Valentino, but their marriage ended in divorce in 2020. In 2022, Fox was briefly linked to rapper Ye (Kanye West) after meeting him at a New Year's party in Miami. Despite an initial connection with West, their relationship ended within a month, reportedly.\n\nAlso recognized as a music artist, Fox, during a 2023 interview on the Drew Barrymore Show candidly shared with the host that she had \"sworn off men.\" Barrymore then inquired what Fox sought in a relationship. \"It would need to be someone who also has to have kids, so they understand that they can never come first...Then it would have to be someone who's OK with seeing me once a week for a two-hour window.\"\n\nIn her 2023 memoir, Down the Drain, Fox detailed her brief relationship with the Hollywood rapper, referring to him only as \"the artist.\" She questioned the authenticity of their relationship and wrote, \"I'm disconnected from the moment. I try to find gratitude for the lavish gifts, but the feeling of insincerity lingers.\" \"The only time he engages is when the camera is on us...when he will grab me and kiss me passionately.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Fox also recounted how Ye offered to get her a boob job while she was trying on her new Diesel wardrobe at a hotel.

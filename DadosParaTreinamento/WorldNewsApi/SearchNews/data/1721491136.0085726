The complaint alleges that Adobe \u2014 known for design tools like Photoshop and InDesign \u2014 steered online consumers to its \u201cannual paid monthly\u201d subscription option by preselecting that plan as a default. The FTC also claims that Adobe \u201cburies\u201d disclosures related to its early-termination fee for that plan in the fine print or under icons that users have to hover their mouse cursor over to see. The agency said Adobe has used that fee \u2014 which amounts to half of the leftover monthly payments if a user cancels within their first year \u2014 to \u201cambush consumers to deter them from cancelling their subscriptions.\u201d \u201cWhen consumers have attempted to cancel their subscription on the company\u2019s website, they have been forced to navigate numerous pages in order to cancel,\u201d the FTC said. \u201cWhen consumers reach out to Adobe\u2019s customer service to cancel, they encounter resistance and delay from Adobe representatives,\u201d the agency continued. \u201cConsumers also experience other obstacles, such as dropped calls and chats, and multiple transfers. Some consumers who thought they had successfully cancelled their subscription reported that the company continued to charge them until discovering the charges on their credit card statements.\u201d The lawsuit seeks civil penalties and \u201cunspecified amounts of consumer redress\u201d from Adobe, and a permanent court order preventing the company from future violations, the Justice Department said. The two executives named in the lawsuit are Maninder Sawhney, an Adobe vice president, and David Wadhwani, president of Adobe\u2019s Digital Media business. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. For more than a decade, Adobe has sold its software on a subscription basis; those subscriptions, the FTC said, make up most of its sales. However, more recently, analysts have been worried about steeper competition facing the company. In a statement, Adobe disputed the allegations detailed in the complaint. \u201cWe are transparent with the terms and conditions of our subscription agreements and have a simple cancellation process,\u201d Dana Rao, general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe, said. \u201cWe will refute the FTC\u2019s claims in court.\u201d The action is the latest from Biden administration regulators as they\u2019ve looked to rein in merger deals and other corporate practices that they say stifle competition and harm consumers, many of whom are struggling with inflation. Shares of Adobe are down 13% so far this year. However, shares got a boost last week following the company\u2019s quarterly results, which were helped by a more upbeat forecast for its Creative Cloud subscription offerings, which includes apps like Photoshop and Illustrator.", "summary": "U.S. regulators on Monday sued on Adobe Inc., accusing the software company and two executives of \u201cdeceiving consumers\u201d by hiding the termination fee for a popular subscription plan and making it too difficult for customers to cancel subscriptions.", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/adobe-sued-by-u-s-regulators-for-making-it-too-difficult-to-cancel-subscriptions-2ecfdef5?mod=mw_rss_topstories", "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-848639?width=1280&size=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:13:48", "author": "Bill Peters", "authors": ["Bill Peters"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.749}

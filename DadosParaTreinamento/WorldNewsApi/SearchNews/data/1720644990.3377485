The Scottish wrestler, who will take on Bayley for the WWE Women\u2019s Championship next weekend in Glasgow at Clash At The Castle, proved her potential as a major force on Friday night despite some of the crowd belittling her. Despite \u2018Stone Cold\u2019 Steve Austin creating them over two decades ago, the \u2018What?\u2019 chants he made popular still ring out in stadiums across the United States. Plenty of fans have moved on, but others still attempt to distract from what the superstars are saying by shouting it in between lines in their promos. Although former champ Piper\u2019s heartfelt words resonated with viewers around the world, the \u2018What?\u2019 chants started, and she joined the long list of superstars finding creative ways to shut them down. In an absolutely savage moment, she simply said, \u2018Inbreds say what?\u2019 without missing a beat, and unfortunately for the Kentucky crowd, they weren\u2019t quite fast enough to avoid her trap. The Scottish star will face Bayley at Clash At The Castle next weekend (Picture: WWE/Craig Ambrosio) Piper\u2019s little smirk said it all, and fans online were delighted with her response \u2013 but most people agreed the chant itself is very tired by this point. \u2018Good way to respond to those chants. Sick of Americans being disrespectful to anybody who has an accent with the USA or WHAT chants,\u2019 wrote @Cory_Hays407, while @DreamCJen added: \u2018Piper is so good. She deserves so much better.\u2019 \u2018The promo of her life ????,\u2019 praised @313Smark, as @straightedgekas tweeted: \u201920 years past and US crowds still saying what chants ?\u2019 She delivered in front of a packed SmackDown crowd (Picture: WWE/Michael Maques) Thankfully for fans further afield, the chant isn\u2019t quite so prevalent, and the already-iconic crowd at Backlash in Lyon, France has shown exactly how some creativity can lead to an electric atmosphere. With WWE heading to Glasgow next weekend, fans in the US and across the globe are anticipating a break from the \u2018what?\u2019 chants. \u2018Good. I love when wrestlers get them like that. Good thing we won\u2019t have to witness it at CATC. Love them international crowds,\u2019 said @SamirParvez. The epic championship clash is coming to Glasgow (Picture: WWE) Piper, who moved to the US full time three years ago, previously admitted there is definitely a big difference being stateside compared to her homeland. \u2018It\u2019s such a culture shock being here in America. You think because they\u2019re both English-speaking countries, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, it\u2019ll be the same\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely not the same,\u2019 she exclusively told Metro.co.uk shortly after her Raw debut in 2021. She said at the time: \u2018I\u2019m getting used to it. I\u2019m getting used to the crazy Florida drivers, all the different sorts of things. It\u2019s absolutely mental, but I\u2019m really enjoying it.\u2019 Clash At The Castle comes to Glasgow, Scotland on June 15. Tune in via the WWE Network, and click here for tickets. Got a story?

But it could be the last go-around for this particular lineup.\n\nSpeaking with Entertainment Tonight in May 2024, Gorga said her long-running feud with Giudice was taken to the next level by the end of season 14.\n\n\"I think the finale is so dirty and just not good,\" Gorga said. \"It's just a big no-no what happened.\" She also shared that the finale \"puts a cork\" once and for all in any chance to reconcile with her estranged sister-in-law.\n\nThe 14th season of \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" will premiere on May 5, 2024, per a trailer released by Bravo.\n\nAt BravoCon in November 2023, RHONJ star Dolores Catania told Page Six that there was \"a big bomb\" dropped at the finale. \"And you would never know what it would be,\" she shared. \"There's two bombs at the finale,\" she added, before describing the drama as \"the Last Supper.\"\n\nMonths later, Catania appeared on the \"Sherri\" show and told host Sherri Shepherd that there's no hope for the Gorga-Giudice family to ever reconcile.\n\n\"I really think it's the end,\" she said. \"I've seen these fights we've all seen the fights over the years, but I think this is the finale.

And I think sometimes it's just gone too far and just because it's your family doesn't mean you have to love them,\" she added of the feuding siblings. \"So much water has gone under the bridge and so many things you cannot go back from. ... I think it's time that they just admit that they can't stand each other and it's done and over.\"\n\nComments about the irreparable rift come weeks after Bravo host Andy Cohen admitted he doesn't think Giudice and Gorga's estrangement would be \"sustainable\" on future seasons of RHONJ. The sisters-in-law filmed the entire 14 season without speaking to one another.\n\nOn an April 2024 episode of Sirius XM's \"Andy Cohen Live,\" Cohen said, \"It isn't a sustainable universe to have kind of two camps on the show.\" He noted that while the divide \"worked\" for season 14, it can't go on. \"They're both, you know, they're both stars and they've been on the show, you know, forever. So it worked this season. But I stand by what I'm saying that for the future, it's not sustainable,\" he said of Gorga and Giudice.\n\nBoth women have said they have no plans to leave \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Honey, I started this show, I am not going anywhere. I am not going anywhere,\" Giudice told E! News in 2023.\n\nGorga made a similar statement on her \"On Display\" podcast. \"I just want everyone to know, I'm not leaving the show,\" she said last year. \"No, I have no intentions [of] leaving. I never run away when the going gets tough, that's not my personality.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with People magazine, Gorga said she would know when the \"time is right\" to make her exit. \"For right now, I love Bravo. I love being a part of the show,\" she said. \"I think we'll know when the time is right and it's just not working anymore. ... When the time is right, I will walk, and I will take it as a wonderful memory.\"\n\nBut in the April interview with ET, Gorga deferred to Bravo to make the final decision on her fate on 'The Real Housewives of New Jersey.\"\n\n\"Whatever Bravo decides to do is fine with me,\" she said about season 15. \"I don't make demands. I come to work, I have a very strong relationship with the show ... so, I feel like whoever they decide to cast -- or not cast -- I'm fine, in my own lane with my own family and my own kids, and I'll deal with it when I have to deal with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_miller@heavy.com", "name": "Victoria Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bravo (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorga,_Lazio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gorga, Lazio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gorga, Lazio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_New_Jersey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of New Jersey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Giudice", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Giudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Catania", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dolores Catania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherri_Shepherd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sherri Shepherd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Josephs", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Josephs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race_(season_14)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RuPaul's Drag Race (season 14)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Gorga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Gorga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Got_Talent_(season_15)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "America's Got Talent (season 15)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E!

They shared their thoughts with TheWrap about taping separately from their costar Teresa Giudice, who they are closest to this season and those rumors about Fuda's husband John.\n\n\"I just think people were sick of the family drama, and they were sick of the back and forth. This year is not about that. So it's refreshing,\" Gorga told TheWrap, noting there was barely any communication with her sister-in-law this time around. \"We kind of just did our own things. There were a couple events that we were together at, obviously, but very little to zero communication.\"\n\nFrom what fans could see in the Bravo trailer, no friend group nor romantic relationship is safe this season. Dynamics change and friends fall off, a situation Fuda said she was not expecting as she stepped into her sophomore year of \"RHONJ.\" Heading back to the full cast are Gorga, Fuda, Giudice, Dolores Catania, Danielle Cabral, Margaret Josephs and Jennifer Aydin. Jackie Goldschneider and Jennifer Fessler also return as friends of the show.\n\n\"Among this group of women, that was really disappointing to me. I didn't see the dynamics necessarily changing, and they did,\" Fuda explained. \"It's upsetting because when you get to know these girls, who they are, and you let them into your lives and your family, you spend time together, they become real, true friendships and relationships. And then when you start to kind of see the evolution of like, the wires coming off of who they are and what their morals are, it can sometimes be really disappointing.\"\n\nBoth Fuda and Gorga said their main group of friends included Josephs and one another, with Gorga throwing in Catania as well.\n\n\"I'm very close with Dolores. I'm very close with Margaret. I'm very close with Rachel. I would say I'm closest with all three of them,\" Gorga explained. \"I don't talk to my sister-in-law. Jen and I try a bit this season. There's just so much coming out right now on social media that I just don't know.\"\n\nWhile Fuda said she's cool with Cabral now, she added that \"Teresa and Jen are just not [her] kind of people,\" mentioning that there's no \"hope\" for a future relationship between her and Giudice.\n\n\"I don't need people like that in my life,\" Fuda reiterated.\n\nThis season, Fuda said she found her voice and is now more comfortable balancing her personal life with filming. That comes in handy, considering she will be dealing with rumors about what her husband likes to do in the bedroom. The subject will be addressed in season.\n\n\"That was something that we definitely knew was going to be talked about to some capacity,\" Fuda explained. \"It's unfortunate that it was weaponized and used against him when it's not something that he is ashamed of ... it's not anyone else's story to tell except my husband's, and that opportunity was taken away from him.\"\n\nFor now, both ladies are going to \"roll with the punches,\" no matter how strenuous some relationships on the show may be. However, Gorga admitted she wouldn't be opposed to eventual casting news.\n\n\"As far as the cast changing, I hope so. We'll see. I love some of them, too. I mean, we'll see. That's Bravo's situation and Bravo's deal, so they'll figure that all out. For me, I just do me no matter who's on the show,\" she said.\n\nUltimately, Gorga promised \"shocking\" moments viewers should stay tuned for.\n\n\"The finale is very 'wow' for me. I just can't believe ... Like, everyone will see why I have turned it off after they see that finale,\" she said, referring to her longstanding familial issues. \"It's related to family in general.\"", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raquel_rocky_harris@thewrap.com", "name": "Raquel Rocky Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorga,_Lazio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gorga, Lazio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gorga, Lazio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Giudice", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Giudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_New_Jersey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of New Jersey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race_(season_14)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RuPaul's Drag Race (season 14)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Gorga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Gorga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Catania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolores Catania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bravo (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Josephs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Josephs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-22-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540772", "eventUri": "eng-9540772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Season 14 of The Real Housewives of New Jerseyofficially returns to Bravo. The Garden State is about to become a battleground once again as the sensational reality TV saga gears up for its upcoming season. In the new season, new viewers and longtime fans can expect nothing short of fireworks as the lives of our seven favorite housewives undergo life-changing shifts. From shocking family revelations to jaw-dropping accusations, Season 14 promises to take audiences further into the tumultuous world of New Jersey's elite.\n\nSeason 14 of The Real Housewives of New Jerseyofficially premieres on Sunday, May 5 at 8/7c on Bravo. New episodes are available to stream the next day on Peacock. In the meantime, check out who's returning to The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 14.\n\nRelated What You Need To Know About 'The Real Housewives of New Jersey' Season 14 The new season explores the aftermath of Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga's highly publicized fallout from the Season 13 finale. Teresa Giudice\n\nTeresa Giudice is all about promoting a fit and healthful lifestyle. A New York Times bestselling author, Giudice is the brainchild behind four cookbooks sharing recipes guaranteed to make readers fit and fabulous. Equipped with her degree in fashion marketing and management, the working mom put her business acumen to the test by participating in NBC's Celebrity Apprentice, where she managed to raise $70,000 for charity. Other times, she can be found tending to her four daughters and maintaining her zen through yoga, which has helped her go through difficult times.\n\nBack in Season 13, Giudice tied the knot with her long-time loverLuis Ruelas in East Brunswick, New Jersey. However, her wedding also picked up media attention for all the wrong reasons. Giudice's brother Joe Gorga, and his wife slash fellow housewife Melissa Gorga, decided to skip the nuptials, culminating in an immense feud that would later on cut their family ties once and for all.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Giudice's and Melissa's tense relationship has always been a running theme of the show. Unfortunately, things took an all-time low when Giudice and Ruelas were involved in spreading a cheating rumor about Melissa, prompting the Gorgas to not attend her wedding. Although it seems like the two can no longer make amends, Season 14 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey might see a plot twist that could salvage their broken relationship.\n\nMelissa Gorga\n\nMelissa Gorga is the epitome of the modern housewife. On top of being married to Joe and being the mom of three children, Gorga showcases her passion for fashion by running her own clothing boutique Envy by Melissa Gorga. If that's not enough, Gorga has also branched out her business in the digital sphere, opening an online retail store EnvybyMG.com. When she's not busy staying on track with her career, Gorga can be seen talking on her podcast \"On Display\". Although she's already got a lot on her plate - family, friendships, and her booming enterprise - Gorga constantly looks for opportunities to push herself and could never say no to new challenges.\n\nThe last time audiences saw her, Gorga was seen going through difficult times with Giudice. Skipping Giudice's wedding for a day at the beach eventually became the last straw, with Gorga and Giudice no longer on talking terms. With their rift highly publicized, speculations arise as to what actually happened between the two housewives. Although not many details have been shared, it was reported that the two were involved in a behind-the-scenes fight during the filming of Season 13, further severing ties. While the full story remains a complete mystery, it's clear that Melissa no longer wants to be a part of the drama.\n\nMargaret Josephs\n\nMargaret Josephs is best known for her phrase \"caviar dreams, tuna fish budget\". An FIT graduate with a degree in marketing and fashion design, Josephs has put her education to good use by founding her own global lifestyle brands and launching a line of girl products under her lines Macbeth Collection and Candie Couture by Margaret Josephs. Besides the retail industry, Josephs is also deep in the food and beverage business. Being a certified mocktail queen herself, Josephs is also behind her own line of non-alcoholic mocktails, Soir\u00e9e. Business isn't the only thing in Josephs's brain. During her free time, the housewife spends her time helping her local community and tending to her house renovations.\n\nLast season, Josephs was seen under hot water with some of the other housewives. As of the Season 13 reunion, Josephs has made it clear that she and Jennifer Aydin are on good terms. Previously, Josephs was the one who allegedly brought Aydin's husband's affair to the public eye. While Josephs had her intentions, it's clear that Josephs' revelation brought much shock to the Aydin household. Being the one to reveal other peoples' truths, it was Josephs who also broke the news about Dolores Catania's boyfriend, whom audiences later found out that he was still legally married to his estranged wife.\n\nDolores Catania\n\nDolores Catanianever thought she would go on the path to reality TV fame. The child of a Chief of Police, Catania's humble beginnings have shaped her into the housewife she is today. Back before she started appearing on TV screens, Catania worked different odd jobs to support herself. Her extensive portfolio includes working as a waitress, shampoo girl, surgical assistant, and later on within the prison system. With a myriad of experiences under her belt, Catania channels her energy into helping the less fortunate, dedicating herself to charity work. From animal rescue organizations to women's shelters, it's no secret that Catania is voted \"Miss Congeniality\".\n\nCatania's relationship with boyfriend Connell has been the highlight of last season, primarily thanks to Josephs. While it's unclear when they first started dating, the two made things official on Instagram in 2022. Since then, there have been talks about whether the couple will be taking the next step: marriage. However, as of September 2023, Connell was reported to be still legally married to his estranged wife. While Connell is reported to have finalized his divorce, based on the trailer for Season 14, Catania appears to question their different expectations in their relationship.\n\nJennifer Aydin\n\nJennifer Aydin spent the majority of her life under her parents' wings. Now that she's all independent, Aydin has learned to make her mark by opening her own jewelry store. But since marrying Dr. Bill Aydin, the housewife has closed shop and focused all her time and energy on her five children. Coming from a strong Turkish background, family has always been her number one priority. But since her children are all grown up, Aydin has returned to the world of business, launching her first beauty product \"The Ultimate Beauty Pillow: Lips, Lashes, Brows\". As the group's \"funny girl\", she makes everyone around her laugh with her random quips.\n\nThroughout Season 13, the Aydins gave couples therapy a shot in an attempt to save their marriage. As fans would remember, the pair had some arguments regarding Bill's habit of going to the pool house after work instead of being present with the family. While Bill has his own reasons, which are fairly understandable, it became clear that the two weren't on the same page in their marriage. After a series of long discussions, it seems the two have now patched up, and their relationship has thrived ever since.\n\nDanielle Cabral\n\nDanielle Cabral loves everything extra. Making her mark with her bold attitude, Cabral makes use of her energy to launch her flashy young children's clothing company, Boujie Kidz. Not everyone can handle her huge personality, but her husband of 10 years Nate has always been her number #1 cheerleader. Crab is also the mother to her two children, Dominic and Valentina. First introduced to The Real Housewives of New Jersey in Season 13, this isn't the first time Cabral's been on the screen. Prior to the show, Cabral appeared on an episode of True Life, focusing on her identity as a true Staten Island Girl. Although she's new to the show, Cabral is seen to be friendly with the likes of Giudice, Aydin, and Catania.\n\nRachel Fuda\n\nRachel Fuda spends most of her time working for her and her husband John's business, Valet King. If that's not enough, the husband and wife also play a huge role in her husband's family's company, Fuda Tile. Throughout Season 13, Fuda was in the middle of adopting Jaiden, John's son from his previous marriage. However, the process itself wasn't smooth sailing. From attempting to reach out to his estranged birth mother, to receiving discouraging advice from her law attorneys, things took a toll on Fuda. It didn't help that there were rumors that Fuda adopted her son for entertainment purposes. As of today, Fuda is reported to have completed the adoption process.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey TV-14Reality TV\n\nRelease Date May 12, 2009 Cast Teresa Giudice , Melissa Gorga , Joe Gorga

The father of three stated that he did so because he felt \"attacked,\" presumably by Giudice. He also said certain RHONJ personalities brought up his 2008 arrest.\n\n\"When you are being attacked -- I feel like I'm being attacked, you have to -- you have to defend yourself. When you past has come out and it was like 20-something years ago - why are doing that? Why are you digging stuff up from my past? That's not fair,\" said John Fuda.\n\nThe businessman also stated that he did not intend to get involved with the drama on the series when his wife joined RHONJ during season 13.\n\n\"I wanted to have fun with this. I wanted to go out and drink. And have a good time. The next thing you know I feel like I'm Teresa's storyline this year. If it wasn't for me, what else would she have?\" said John Fuda.\n\nWhile recording the May 2024 \"Two Ts In A Pod\" episode, Rachel Fuda noted that the RHONJ cast was divided during season 14. She referenced that Giudice and her estranged sister-in-law Melissa Gorga \"refused to film\" together for the show's 14th season. She stated that while she had \"fun\" filming, \"it was a stressful season.\" The 33-year-old also said she disagreed with how some of her castmates behaved during RHONJ season 14.\n\n\"I feel like there's a lot of toxicity in our cast. On our show. And I don't think there's a place for it, in any work environment,\" said Rachel Fuda.\n\nGorga discussed filming the 14th season of RHONJ while speaking to Entertainment Tonight in May 2024. She stated that she and Giudice did not film scenes together, outside of group events, for season 14. She also said she accepted that she and her husband, Joe Gorga, will not make up with his sister.\n\n\"I fought for so many years. For other people, honestly. More than even myself. I fought for the family and for my husband and my kids. And I realized that it's not worth fighting for and I'm actually not doing them any favors,\" said Gorga.\n\n\"I covered a lot for my brother throughout the years. I did that because of my parents. A lot that is going to come out that you will see,\" said the reality television personality.\n\nShe also suggested that her husband, Luis \"Louie\" Ruelas, had difficulty filming the series.\n\n\"On the show, you have people who have nothing better to do than to focus on trying to hurt, like, me and my husband.

Giudice refers to Ruelas as her soulmate saying, \"I was mad at God at one point because I didn't understand like why I had to go to jail, and then I lost my mother and then I lost my father, but I finally got my answer. I went through all of this in order to meet my soulmate, Louie.\"\n\nWhile Giudice and her daughters seemingly love him, not everyone is a fan of Ruelas.\n\nJennifer Fessler sits down for lunch with Margaret Josephs who talks about how she has been feeling since her ex-husband Jan Josephs died in 2022. They also talk about Fessler's birthday, Josephs telling her they are going to go out to dinner Tuesday night and hiding the fact that Rachel Fuda and Fessler's husband Jeff are planning a surprise party for her.\n\n\"Interestingly for my birthday Jenn [Aydin] texted me, Danielle [Cabral] DM'd me ... Teresa called me on my birthday,\" said Fessler.\n\n\"As far as I am concerned, she is dead to me, and I mean that. Her and her husband,\" says Josephs about Giudice asking Fessler to never mention her in conversation with them. \"I do not want them to utter my name ... you know what, I don't ever want to talk about her again.\"\n\nIn the next scene Giudice and Ruelas sit down for dinner with Dolores Catania and her boyfriend Paul Connell where Giudice reveals a rumor that she heard about a meeting that allegedly occurred before the last season's reunion episode.\n\n\"Frank [Catania] told Louie that they all met at Margaret's house before New York happened to have a plan to go against Louie and I,\" says Teresa. \"And another thing I heard which I want to ask Jenn Fessler about, Danielle told me at New York Jenn Fessler said to the group sitting across from us, 'You guys didn't execute the plan correctly.\"\n\n\"It's normal to have a meeting of the minds before the reunion, I think we all do it. This is how I am looking at it and this is why I don't feel like this is so groundbreaking,\" says Dolores in a confessional with producers.\n\nThe second half of the episode takes place at Fessler's surprise party with almost everyone in attendance except for Ruelas who had a last minute \"business meeting.\"\n\nPrior to the party, Ruelas reached out to John Fuda, asking if he would get together and hoping they could \"clear the air\" after Ruelas allegedly hired a private investigator to look into Fuda's past. Last year, rumors were circulating online about Fuda, particularly a rumor that he used to deal drugs with Teresa saying that Fuda's ex called him \"the biggest drug dealer in Bergen County.\"\n\nFollowing a few awkward \"hellos\" around the party, Fessler's surprise was a success until an argument broke out among the men.\n\n\"Where's your boy, your boy didn't show up,\" said Joe Gorga to Connell, referring to Ruelas.\n\n\"He's away on business,\" said Connell.\n\nJohn Fuda replied, \"I'm surprised because he reached out to me and said he wanted to talk. I said I would see you here on Tuesday. He's not here, so whatever, it is what it is.\"\n\nConnell did not hesitate to stand up for Ruelas saying, \"I was talking to him, and he showed me that text. You want to meet somebody in person, a party is not the place to talk to him. So, I said to him I understand where John is coming from, but I wouldn't have that conversation at something like this. I would have it at a coffee place. Sit down and get it all out.\"\n\n\"Why would I give a man who disrespected my family the respect to meet him somewhere,\" responded Fuda.\n\nTension quickly rose and shouting began among the group, the other men accusing Connell of being on Ruela's side until Catania stepped in to break up the fighting.\n\n\"Always know where the exit is,\" she says as she ushers Connell out the door. \"My dad taught me that. Now it's time to leave.\"\n\nGiudice and Jennifer Aydin walk over to Rachel Fuda to say goodbye and Giudice confronts her about the ongoing issue between their husbands, bringing up the drug-dealer rumors once again.\n\nAs Giudice heads for the door, John Fuda approaches her saying, \"You don't know s---. Don't go down this route. Stop trying to hit me for that.\"\n\nGiudice turns around and leaves with John shouting \"has been\" at her as she walks out the door, a drama-filled ending to episode one.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Jersey"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race_(season_14)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RuPaul's Drag Race (season 14)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Gorga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Gorga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housewife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Housewife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_New_Jersey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of New Jersey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Giudice", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Giudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bravo (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_State_Plaza", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garden State Plaza"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorga,_Lazio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gorga, Lazio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gorga, Lazio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Delaware", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Delaware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Catania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolores Catania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Josephs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Josephs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bergen County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bergen County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/07/PNJM/72879613007-rhonj-season-13-bravo.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2999,1687,x0,y56&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540772", "eventUri": "eng-9540772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Melissa criticizes Jackie Goldschneider for her actions, calling them weak and random. The RHONJ premiere reveals tensions between the cast, with Melissa displaying no love lost for Teresa.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey star Melissa Gorga has always been consistent on the show by being outspoken about what she likes and even more vocal about what she doesn't agree with. She has no problem fighting her own battles. Ahead of the Season 14 premiere, the RHONJ star spoke to Entertainment Tonight about what the latest is with estranged sister-in-law Teresa Giudice, what she thinks of friend of the Housewives, and former Housewife, Jackie Goldschneider, following their falling out. The reality star also dished on the pre-reunion meetup between several cast members that Teresa claims was an effort to take her down.\n\nDuring the Season 14 premiere, Teresa and her husband Luis Ruelas informed friend and fellow Housewife Dolores Catania and her partner Paul \"Paulie\" Connell that Dolores' ex-husband Frank Catania told them Margaret Josephs held a meeting at her home before the reunion to conspire against Teresa and Luis with her co-stars. However, Melissa justified it, saying that: \"It's totally normal. We had investigators investigating us! Of course, we're going to sit around and be like, 'What are we doing with this guy?'\" she said, as reported by Reality Blurb. The \"On Display\" singer references Luis' hiring of a private investigator to secretly investigate other members of the cast.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey TV-14Reality TV\n\nAnother installment of Bravo's \"The Real Housewives\" reality show.

It wasn't such, like, a planned event.\"\n\nReferring to Teresa's implication that there was more to it, Melissa responded: \"Like, it's just so crazy, you know, for her to make it sound that way. It's just another one of those not-so-true things that she just spits out into the world to try to make it look like something it's not.\"\n\nRelated Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga Should Actually Be Best Friends Blood is thicker than water. These two sisters-in-law actually have striking similarities!\n\nSo, it would appear from Melissa's comments that there is still no love lost between her and Teresa, the sister of her husband Joe Gorga. In the same interview, Melissa indicated that she was disappointed with former friend Jackie Goldschneider and her falling out with Margaret Josephs, who has slammed Jackie as the 'Judas of the cast', after Jackie has been seemingly getting closer to former nemesis Teresa and fellow Housewife Jennifer Aydin.\n\nMelissa said she felt that Jackie's actions were weak, saying: \"I think it's Jackie's choice, but I do think it's weak. I think it's weak... doesn't make a lot of sense.

Cohen asked her if she thought the pair would last as friends, to which Catania replied, \"We don't know, right? We don't know what will last. I'm happy to see anyone make up always. I'm always an advocate for that. But a friendship that's based on the dislike for another person doesn't usually last. It has to have a strong foundation. So I just hope it's all for the right intentions, that friendship.\"\n\nWhile Catania didn't confirm the exact timeline behind Giudice and Goldschneider's newfound friendship, or the common enemy that she claims is the basis of their alliance, it's been made clear throughout the season 14 production process that Goldschneider, a former \"Housewife\" who now serves as a part time \"Friend of\" on the series, had a falling out with her former RHONJ co-star and besite Margaret Josephs.\n\nJosephs commented on the pair's rift while on the red carpet of the People's Choice Awards back in February 2024. \"It's disappointing and it's sad. And I guess she's not who I thought she was. But that's okay. Things happen,\" she said.\n\nMelissa Gorga chimed in during the interview to confirm she is also more distant from Goldschneider than in the past, \"Jackie just had a change of heart on a bunch of different things. And feelings,\" Gorga shared. \"Jackie and I are not completely not speaking. But we're definitely not where we were.\"\n\nGorga did clarify that her rift with Goldschneider has nothing to do with the latter's friendship with her sister-in-law, Giudice, however Goldschneider doesn't fully believe that, as evidenced in her November 2023 \"Two Ts in a Pod\" podcast interview.\n\n\"Listen, if we're going to be honest, I think she doesn't like that I'm close with Teresa. That's the honest truth. But she tries to not let that show, but I think that's true,\" Goldschneider said.\n\nOutside of her stop by the Bravo Clubhouse, Catania celebrated the new season premiere with some of her fellow Housewives.\n\n\"Cheers to the premiere!!! \ud83e\udd42 I hope everyone enjoyed the first episode of #RHONJ Season 14 as much as we did! \ud83d\udc9c #bravo #wwhl #rhonj,\" Catania captioned her May 6 Instagram post, which featured photos of her alongside RHONJ co-stars Melissa and Joe Gorga, Margaret Josephs and Joe Benigno, Jenn Fessler, and Catania's boyfriend Paul Connell.

There has been no shortage of drama along the way with ever present Teresa Giudice often at the centre of the action.\n\nHer sister-in-law Melissa Gorga has also proved a hit with viewers too, having first been seen in season two. Whilst the show largely follows the lives of the ladies, their husbands - most notably Joe Giudice and Joe Gorga - are never far from scrutiny too and themselves have played a key role in the programme's success.\n\nREAD MORE: Real Housewives of New Jersey star suffers 'ghost' scare in New York earthquake\n\nREAD MORE: Real Housewives star's heart 'shattered' as beloved son Josh dies at 35\n\nNow, as season 14 debuts today (May 6), we take a look back at some of the show's most shocking moments in its 15-year history.\n\nTable Flip\n\nBack in the show's first series, Teresa threw a dinner table at co-star Danielle Staub during a heated argument that has become one of RHONJ's most iconic scenes. At the time, Teresa claimed she took action because Danielle was \"going after\" her girlfriend. She explained: \"I was sticking up for my girlfriend. I'm a girl's girl.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Afterwards, everyone loved it. So then I embraced it. You know, I don't like the picture that everybody posted with that mean, face it out and I was like, I should have been smiling, but I, everyone loves it. So, you know, because everyone else loves it. I've embraced it.\"\n\nTeresa even went as far as mocking the scene by recreating it during one of her performances on Dancing With The Stars with professional dancer, Pasha Pashkov in a 2022 Jive. Last year, however, she admitted the incident left her with instant regret as she told BravoCon 2023: \"Let me tell you the truth - after I did it, I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I just do?' Like, I wasn't proud of it. I really wasn't. That was the first time I ever did that. I got that mad.\"\n\nHair pulling\n\nDanielle found herself at the centre of the drama during another incident in season 10. Then, the now 61-year old pulled at the hair of Margaret Josephs during a private shopping trip that saw years of bickering come to a head.\n\nThe action first saw Margaret throw a glass of wine over Danielle, who returned the complement by yanking her ponytail. Clearly having no regrets, Danielle later commented: \"I would love to know why Margaret feels that she needs to pour things on me, throw things at me, yell at me, talk about my past as if she was a part of it, get involved with my marriage, get involved with my relationships.\n\n\"She's affected my life in a very bad way and all I did was help her fit into the group in the beginning. She owes me not only a big apology, but she should give me a lot of gratitude.\"\n\nMoments before the row, Danielle had dumped the contents of Margaret's handbag into a large candle. \"It made me feel happy,\" she told E Online, before revealing her surprise that the rest of the cast were shocked by it all.\n\n\"All of them, collectively, really are just the most disgusting vile people ever,\" she raged. \"I would never be around a group like that again. And you know what? They should be very careful. I do hold secrets of theirs of my own, for a long time I've held those secrets. You never know when it's going to blow.\"\n\nImprisonment\n\nTeresa and her ex-husband Joe Giudice first encountered legal trouble in 2013 and were jailed on federal fraud charges. The pair were accused of exaggertaing their income in order to acquire bank loans before they found TV fame.\n\nJoe was also convicted for failing to file tax returns between 2004 and 2008 and was placed behind bars for 41 months. Teresa, meanwhile, served 15 months. According to People, the then-spouses antagonised judge Esther Salas by withholding information in court that saw $75,000 unaccounted for.\n\nJudge Salas subsequently told Teresa in court: Teresa: \"On one hand, I see you're a savvy businesswoman. But then you're going to tell me you don't know how to cooperate with probation? Full disclosure of your financial assets was a requirement. The lack of transparency, that's what offends the court.\"\n\nShe continued: \"For a moment I thought about probation. I don't honestly believe you understand or respect the law. I need to send a message. In the eye of the law, it doesn't matter who you are. There are consequences to pay.\"\n\nTeresa was relased from prison on December 23, 2015, whilst Joe was incarcerated until March 14, 2019. On his release he was immediately transferred directly to an immigration detention centre, before heading to Italy.\n\nFamily Feud\n\nA family feud dragged out on RHONJ for more than a decade with - you guessed it - Teresa at the centre of the drama. It followed Teresa's aforementioned jail term, and saw her brother, Joe Gorga, and his wife, Melissa join the show's cast in season three allegedly against her wishes.\n\nTeresa went on to accuse the Gorgas of joining the show \"to bring her down\", but Joe insisted it was to become \"closer\" to the family, later adding that fame had \"gone to Teresa's head\". The show's executive producer for series one and two - Carlos King - later backed Teresa's claims, however, telling his podcast show that the Gorgas had been persistent in contacting him to ask if they could join.\n\nIn a reunion show in 2022, a comment by Joe about Teresa's daughter Gia seemingly tipped her over the edge for good. Joe alleged that Gia had said Melissa could \"do better\" than him, prompting Teresa to rage: \"You're f--king disgusting. Disgusting! This is not how I would raise my children, ever! You should be ashamed of yourself. And don't come following me!\"\n\nShe continued her rant: \"He lies about my daughter? I really don't want to go out there anymore and see him,\" she told her husband and producers. \"I don't want to make up with him. I want this over. I am done with him.\"\n\nWant all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox?

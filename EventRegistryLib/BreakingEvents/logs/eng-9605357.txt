DePape, the man convicted of attempting to hold former Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage and attacking her husband with a hammer two years ago, apologized in federal court Tuesday, May 28, 2024, but still received 30 years in prison at an unusual resentencing hearing [...]\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The man convicted of attempting to hold former Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage and attacking her husband with a hammer two years ago apologized in federal court Tuesday, but still received 30 years in prison at an unusual resentencing hearing that resulted from judicial error.\n\nDistrict Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley on May 17 sentenced David DePape to 20 years for attempting to kidnap Nancy Pelosi and 30 years for the October 2022 assault on Paul Pelosi, the maximum for both counts. The sentences would run simultaneously.\n\nBut she had failed to allow the defendant to address the court at that sentencing. Corley scheduled Tuesday's hearing for the limited purpose of allowing DePape to speak for the purpose of mitigating his sentence.\n\nOn Tuesday, she apologized to DePape, 44, and to attorneys for her error and asked if he wished to address the court.\n\nDePape, wearing an orange shirt and orange pants with his hair in a short ponytail, said yes and proceeded to speak quickly off of a piece of paper.\n\n\"I'm sorry for what I did,\" he said, adding that he felt horrible and never meant to hurt Pelosi and that he should have left the house when he realized the former speaker was not there.\n\nDePape said that looking back on that time in his life, he was not doing well. Since then, he said, he has reconnected with his mother and other family members, which is helping him to move forward. He became emotional at the end, prompting his lawyers to comfort him and pat his back.\n\nCorley said the sentence needed to reflect the seriousness of the crime and act as a deterrence to others who may choose to break into the homes of elected officials and hold their spouses hostage and beat them.\n\n\"The message has to be out there that it's absolutely unacceptable to our democracy,\" she said.\n\nDePape will serve 30 years with credit served for the 19 months he has already served, she said. His federal sentence should run concurrently with any punishment given by the state in its trial of DePape. She said she expects him deported back to Canada after he completes his punishment.\n\nNeither prosecutors nor DePape's defense attorneys noted Corley's oversight during the May 17 hearing. But hours after Corley handed down the sentence, prosecutors filed a motion noting that the court failed to offer DePape an opportunity \"to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence\" as required by federal rule.\n\nThey asked the court to reopen the sentencing hearing to allow him that option.\n\nDePape's defense attorneys, however, said in a filing that they opposed bringing their client back to court because doing so would interfere with his state trial. DePape was charged in state court with attempted murder, elder abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. Opening statements in that trial are scheduled to start Wednesday.\n\n\"Given Mr. DePape's neurodiversity and mental-health issues ... preparing him for any resentencing hearing requires significant time, which necessarily takes away from time to prepare for his state trial,\" they wrote.\n\nDePape's defense attorneys had asked the judge to sentence him to 14 years, pointing out that he was going through a difficult period at the time of the attack, had undiagnosed mental health issues and had no prior criminal history.\n\nA jury last year found DePape guilty in November of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on an immediate family member of a federal official. Prosecutors had asked for a 40-year prison term.\n\nThe attack on Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, was captured on police body camera video just days before the 2022 midterm elections and stunned the political world. He suffered two head wounds, including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand were also injured.\n\nAhead of sentencing, one of DePape's attorneys, Angela Chuang, told the judge to consider the prison terms being given to those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"The five most serious sentences for people who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, of literally conspiring to overthrow the government, range from 15 to 22 years,\" Chuang said.\n\nCorley said the Jan. 6 analogy didn't adequately reflect the seriousness of breaking into an elected official's private home. The home attack may have a chilling effect on people seeking office in the future, she said.\n\nDePape admitted during trial that he broke into the Pelosis' home on Oct. 28, 2022, intending to hold the speaker hostage and get her to admit to corruption. \"If she lied, I would break her kneecaps,\" he said.

The sentences would run simultaneously.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Road Accident: Eight Members of Family Killed After Jeep Falls Into Deep Ravine in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nBut she had failed to allow the defendant to address the court at that sentencing. Corley scheduled Tuesday's hearing for the limited purpose of allowing DePape to speak for the purpose of mitigating his sentence.\n\nOn Tuesday, she apologised to DePape, 44, and to attorneys for her error and asked if he wished to address the court.\n\nAlso Read | Papua New Guinea Landslide: India Announces Aide of USD 1 Million for Landslide-Hit Nation.\n\nDePape, wearing an orange shirt and orange pants with his hair in a short ponytail, said yes and proceeded to speak quickly off of a piece of paper.\n\n\"I'm sorry for what I did,\" he said, adding that he felt horrible and never meant to hurt Pelosi and that he should have left the house when he realised the former speaker was not there.\n\nDePape said that looking back on that time in his life, he was not doing well. Since then, he said, he has reconnected with his mother and other family members, which is helping him to move forward. He became emotional at the end, prompting his lawyers to comfort him and pat his back.\n\nCorley said the sentence needed to reflect the seriousness of the crime and act as a deterrence to others who may choose to break into the homes of elected officials and hold their spouses hostage and beat them.\n\n\"The message has to be out there that it's absolutely unacceptable to our democracy,\" she said.\n\nDePape will serve 30 years with credit served for the 19 months he has already served, she said. His federal sentence should run concurrently with any punishment given by the state in its trial of DePape. She said she expects him deported back to Canada after he completes his punishment.\n\nNeither prosecutors nor DePape's defence attorneys noted Corley's oversight during the May 17 hearing. But hours after Corley handed down the sentence, prosecutors filed a motion noting that the court failed to offer DePape an opportunity \"to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence\" as required by federal rule.\n\nThey asked the court to reopen the sentencing hearing to allow him that option.\n\nDePape's defence attorneys, however, said in a filing that they opposed bringing their client back to court because doing so would interfere with his state trial. DePape was charged in state court with attempted murder, elder abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. Opening statements in that trial are scheduled to start Wednesday.\n\n\"Given Mr. DePape's neurodiversity and mental-health issues ... preparing him for any resentencing hearing requires significant time, which necessarily takes away from time to prepare for his state trial,\" they wrote.\n\nDePape's defence attorneys had asked the judge to sentence him to 14 years, pointing out that he was going through a difficult period at the time of the attack, had undiagnosed mental health issues and had no prior criminal history.\n\nA jury last year found DePape guilty in November of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on an immediate family member of a federal official. Prosecutors had asked for a 40-year prison term.\n\nThe attack on Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, was captured on police body camera video just days before the 2022 midterm elections and stunned the political world. He suffered two head wounds, including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand were also injured.\n\nAhead of sentencing, one of DePape's attorneys, Angela Chuang, told the judge to consider the prison terms being given to those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"The five most serious sentences for people who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, of literally conspiring to overthrow the government, range from 15 to 22 years,\" Chuang said.\n\nCorley said the Jan. 6 analogy didn't adequately reflect the seriousness of breaking into an elected official's private home. The home attack may have a chilling effect on people seeking office in the future, she said.\n\nDePape admitted during trial that he broke into the Pelosis' home on Oct. 28, 2022, intending to hold the speaker hostage and get her to admit to corruption. \"If she lied, I would break her kneecaps,\" he said. Nancy Pelosi was not home at the time.\n\nDePape also admitted to bludgeoning Paul Pelosi with a hammer when police showed up, saying his plan to end what he viewed as government corruption was unravelling.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score":

They also requested a new judge, accusing Scott Corley of bias against DePape when she expressed \"strong views\" on the crimes and their impact on the safety of public officials during the original hearing.\n\nThey also said the hearing was an unfair burden on DePape's attorneys in his state trial, and that the rescheduled sentencing hearing would cut into much-needed time for their client to consult with his new legal team.\n\nDePape had faced a combined 50 years in federal prison: 30 years on the assault charge and 20 years for the attempted kidnapping.

He did, apologizing for the attack, before Corley sentenced him again to 30 years in prison, reported ABC7, a local ABC affiliate in San Francisco.\n\nIn November, a jury found DePape guilty of attempting to kidnap a federal officer and assaulting an immediate family member of a federal officer. Prosecutors said the 44-year-old was driven by the far-right conspiracy theories known as QAnon.\n\nDePape broke in through the back door in the early hours of 28 October 2022 with plans to kidnap Nancy Pelosi, interrogate her and post footage online. Instead, he found Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time and awoke to DePape in his bedroom with a hammer and zip ties, asking: \"Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?\"\n\nPaul Pelosi was able to call 911, and police officers arrived just before DePape struck him in the head multiple times with a hammer, knocking him unconscious. Pelosi required surgery for a skull fracture as well as injuries to his arm and hands after the attack, which was captured in police body-camera footage.\n\nPaul Pelosi said his injuries have continued to affect him, according to a letter filed in court. In addition to dizziness and a metal plate that remains in his head, Pelosi said he has struggled with balance and has permanent nerve damage in his left hand.\n\nPelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives at the time of the attack, was in Washington when it occurred.\n\nDePape had a history of promoting conspiracy theories online and had shared misinformation about Covid-19 and the January 6 insurrection, as well as false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from Donald Trump.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley offered DePape a do-over to speak to the court while she denied his attorneys' requests to send the case to another judge.\n\nDePape spoke for about a minute. He apologized for harming Paul Pelosi and said he regretted not leaving the house after he broke in and realized Nancy Pelosi was out of town.\n\n\"I should have left when Nancy wasn't there,\" DePape said as he broke into tears and one of his attorneys patted him on the back. \"I feel horrible about hurting Paul Pelosi.\"\n\nCorley apologized for her procedural error in not allowing DePape the chance to speak at his initial sentencing.

The resentencing allowed DePape to address the court, which he had not done previously due to judicial error.\n\nThe man convicted of attempting to hold former Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage and attacking her husband with a hammer two years ago apologised in federal court Tuesday, but still received 30 years in prison at an unusual resentencing hearing that resulted from judicial error.\n\nDistrict Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley on May 17 sentenced David DePape to 20 years for attempting to kidnap Nancy Pelosi and 30 years for the October 2022 assault on Paul Pelosi, the maximum for both counts. The sentences would run simultaneously.\n\nBut she had failed to allow the defendant to address the court at that sentencing. Corley scheduled Tuesday's hearing for the limited purpose of allowing DePape to speak for the purpose of mitigating his sentence.\n\nOn Tuesday, she apologised to DePape, 44, and to attorneys for her error and asked if he wished to address the court.\n\nDePape, wearing an orange shirt and orange pants with his hair in a short ponytail, said yes and proceeded to speak quickly off of a piece of paper.\n\n\"I'm sorry for what I did,\" he said, adding that he felt horrible and never meant to hurt Pelosi and that he should have left the house when he realised the former speaker was not there.\n\nDePape said that looking back on that time in his life, he was not doing well. Since then, he said, he has reconnected with his mother and other family members, which is helping him to move forward. He became emotional at the end, prompting his lawyers to comfort him and pat his back.\n\nCorley said the sentence needed to reflect the seriousness of the crime and act as a deterrence to others who may choose to break into the homes of elected officials and hold their spouses hostage and beat them.\n\n\"The message has to be out there that it's absolutely unacceptable to our democracy,\" she said.\n\nDePape will serve 30 years with credit served for the 19 months he has already served, she said. His federal sentence should run concurrently with any punishment given by the state in its trial of DePape. She said she expects him deported back to Canada after he completes his punishment.\n\nNeither prosecutors nor DePape's defence attorneys noted Corley's oversight during the May 17 hearing. But hours after Corley handed down the sentence, prosecutors filed a motion noting that the court failed to offer DePape an opportunity \"to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence\" as required by federal rule.\n\nThey asked the court to reopen the sentencing hearing to allow him that option.\n\nDePape's defence attorneys, however, said in a filing that they opposed bringing their client back to court because doing so would interfere with his state trial. DePape was charged in state court with attempted murder, elder abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. Opening statements in that trial are scheduled to start Wednesday.\n\n\"Given Mr. DePape's neurodiversity and mental-health issues ... preparing him for any resentencing hearing requires significant time, which necessarily takes away from time to prepare for his state trial,\" they wrote.\n\nDePape's defence attorneys had asked the judge to sentence him to 14 years, pointing out that he was going through a difficult period at the time of the attack, had undiagnosed mental health issues and had no prior criminal history.\n\nA jury last year found DePape guilty in November of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on an immediate family member of a federal official. Prosecutors had asked for a 40-year prison term.\n\nThe attack on Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, was captured on police body camera video just days before the 2022 midterm elections and stunned the political world. He suffered two head wounds, including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand were also injured.\n\nAhead of sentencing, one of DePape's attorneys, Angela Chuang, told the judge to consider the prison terms being given to those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"The five most serious sentences for people who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, of literally conspiring to overthrow the government, range from 15 to 22 years,\" Chuang said.\n\nCorley said the Jan. 6 analogy didn't adequately reflect the seriousness of breaking into an elected official's private home. The home attack may have a chilling effect on people seeking office in the future, she said.\n\nDePape admitted during trial that he broke into the Pelosis' home on Oct. 28, 2022, intending to hold the speaker hostage and get her to admit to corruption. \"If she lied, I would break her kneecaps,\" he said. Nancy Pelosi was not home at the time.\n\nDePape also admitted to bludgeoning Paul Pelosi with a hammer when police showed up, saying his plan to end what he viewed as government corruption was unravelling.

In that January 2023 interview, DePape spoke of his patriotism -- though it's been revealed that he was never a naturalized US citizen, and remains, legally, Canadian -- and said of his conspiracy-inspired list of targets \"I'm so sorry I didn't get more of them... I should have come better prepared.\"\n\nThings have apparently changed in DePape's mental state as he's sat in jail the past year and a half.\n\nPer NBC Bay Area, \"DePape said that looking back on that time in his life, he was not doing well. Since then, he said, he has reconnected with his mother and other family members, which is helping him to move forward.\"\n\nDePape's federal defense attorneys have referred to him as \"neurodivergent,\" and they had filed an objection with the court to bringing DePape back for another sentencing hearing as he is about to face a second trial.\n\n\"Given Mr. DePape's neurodiversity and mental-health issues ... preparing him for any resentencing hearing requires significant time, which necessarily takes away from time to prepare for his state trial,\" the attorneys wrote, per NBC.\n\nNeither federal prosecutors nor his defense attorneys raised the issue in court two weeks ago when the judge neglected to give DePape a chance to speak. It was only later, perhaps hoping to stave off an appeal, that prosecutors raised the issue in a filing with the judge.\n\nJudge Corley resentenced DePape, as she did on the 17th, to 20 years for the count of attempted kidnapping of a federal official, and 30 years for the count of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official. With the sentences to be served concurrently, it amounts to the same 30-year sentence he originally received, with 19 months of credit for time served.\n\nCorley reiterated that a harsh sentence was needed to deter others from attempting to hunt down government officials at their homes, saying, per NBC, \"The message has to be out there that it's absolutely unacceptable to our democracy.\"\n\nDePape isn't likely to get out of jail before he is quite an old man, if even then, with another sentence likely to come in state court. It's not clear, given DePape's many admissions of guilt, why he didn't seek a plea bargain with prosecutors, but perhaps the sentence the SF DA's office was seeking was too harsh for his attorney to accept, and the jury trial is a nothing-to-lose situation.\n\nIn state court, DePape faces charges of attempted murder, false imprisonment, and elder abuse, among other charges.", "source": {"uri": "sfist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNTV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KNTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurodiversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTVU", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KTVU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_served", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time served"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elder abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "False imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://img.sfist.com/2024/05/david-depape-standing3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605357", "eventUri": "eng-9605357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 280, "textEnd": 286}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 537, "textEnd": 543}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Since then, he said, he has reconnected with his mother and other family members, which is helping him to move forward. He became emotional at the end, prompting his lawyers to comfort him and pat his back.\n\nCorley said the sentence needed to reflect the seriousness of the crime and act as a deterrence to others who may choose to break into the homes of elected officials and hold their spouses hostage and beat them.\n\n\"The message has to be out there that it's absolutely unacceptable to our democracy,\" she said.\n\nDePape will serve 30 years with credit served for the 19 months he has already served, she said. His federal sentence should run concurrently with any punishment given by the state in its trial of DePape. She said she expects him deported back to Canada after he completes his punishment.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nNeither prosecutors nor DePape's defense attorneys noted Corley's oversight during the May 17 hearing. But hours after Corley handed down the sentence, prosecutors filed a motion noting that the court failed to offer DePape an opportunity \"to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence\" as required by federal rule.\n\nThey asked the court to reopen the sentencing hearing to allow him that option.\n\nDePape's defense attorneys, however, said in a filing that they opposed bringing their client back to court because doing so would interfere with his state trial. DePape was charged in state court with attempted murder, elder abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. Opening statements in that trial are scheduled to start Wednesday.\n\n\"Given Mr. DePape's neurodiversity and mental-health issues ... preparing him for any resentencing hearing requires significant time, which necessarily takes away from time to prepare for his state trial,\" they wrote.\n\nDePape's defense attorneys had asked the judge to sentence him to 14 years, pointing out that he was going through a difficult period at the time of the attack, had undiagnosed mental health issues and had no prior criminal history.\n\nA jury last year found DePape guilty in November of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on an immediate family member of a federal official. Prosecutors had asked for a 40-year prison term.\n\nThe attack on Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, was captured on police body camera video just days before the 2022 midterm elections and stunned the political world. He suffered two head wounds, including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand were also injured.\n\nAhead of sentencing, one of DePape's attorneys, Angela Chuang, told the judge to consider the prison terms being given to those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"The five most serious sentences for people who were convicted of seditious conspiracy, of literally conspiring to overthrow the government, range from 15 to 22 years,\" Chuang said.\n\nCorley said the Jan. 6 analogy didn't adequately reflect the seriousness of breaking into an elected official's private home. The home attack may have a chilling effect on people seeking office in the future, she said.\n\nDePape admitted during trial that he broke into the Pelosis' home on Oct. 28, 2022, intending to hold the speaker hostage and get her to admit to corruption. \"If she lied, I would break her kneecaps,\" he said. Nancy Pelosi was not home at the time.\n\nDePape also admitted to bludgeoning Paul Pelosi with a hammer when police showed up, saying his plan to end what he viewed as government corruption was unraveling.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The sentences, which were the maximum for both counts, will run concurrently.\n\nDePape was also given credit for the 18 months he's already been in custody.\n\nHowever, in a court filing in the days after the sentencing, Corley said there had been a \"clear error\" on her part in not allowing DePape an opportunity to speak to the court, as is required by law.\n\nProsecutors along with DePape's defense attorneys failed to point out the oversight during the initial sentencing hearing. \"Nonetheless, it was the Court's responsibility to personally ask Mr. DePape if he wanted to speak,\" Corley wrote.\n\nHours after Corley handed down the sentence, prosecutors filed a motion noting that the court failed to offer DePape an opportunity \"to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence\" as required by federal rule.

Escalation is not in anyone's interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity.\"\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war.\n\nIran has blamed Israel and said it will \"punish\" it; Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also the Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the situation in the Middle East, including threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and U.S. servicemembers, the White House said. They were also briefed about an attack on Iraq's al Asad airbase on Monday and discussed the U.S. response.\n\nDuring that briefing, Biden and Harris were told by their national security team that it is still unclear when Iran and Hezbollah are likely to launch an attack against Israel \"and the specifics of such an attack,\" according to a U.S. official.\n\nAt least five U.S. personnel were wounded in the rocket strike, U.S. officials told Reuters. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over Haniyeh's killing, in which the U.S. said it had no involvement.\n\nBiden and Harris were also updated on U.S. efforts to support Israel militarily if it is attacked and diplomatic efforts to \"de-escalate regional tension\" and reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza.\n\nBlinken earlier on Monday spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.\n\n\"One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another attack on Israel,\" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.\n\nMiller, speaking at a press briefing, did not say definitively whether or not Washington's messages have been disseminated to Iran or through which channel.\n\n\"I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and impress that point upon the government of Iran,\" he added.\n\nBlinken in his remarks also called for parties to \"break this cycle\" of violence and agree a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, despite the killing of Haniyeh, who was a key figure in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"What it comes down to really is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no,\" Blinken said. \"It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the

U.S. officials are engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation.\n\nThe United States has been urging other countries through diplomatic channels to tell Iran that escalation in the Middle East is not in their interest, a State Department spokesperson said on Monday, at what Secretary of State Antony Blinken called a \"critical moment\" for the region. Blinken said Washington was \"engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock\" to help calm tensions amid fears Iran is preparing a retaliatory strike against Israel.\n\n\"All parties must refrain from escalation,\" Blinken said during a signing ceremony with his Australian counterpart in Washington. \"All parties must take steps to ease tensions.

Iran has blamed Israel and said it will \"punish\" it; Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also the Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by their national security team on the situation in the Middle East, including threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and U.S. servicemembers, the White House said. They were also briefed about an attack on Iraq's al Asad airbase on Monday and discussed the U.S. response. At least five U.S. personnel were wounded in the rocket strike, U.S. officials told Reuters. It was unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over Haniyeh's killing, in which the U.S. said it had no involvement.\n\nBiden and Harris were also updated on U.S. efforts to support Israel militarily if it is attacked and diplomatic efforts to \"de-escalate regional tension\" and reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza. Blinken earlier on Monday spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.\n\n\"One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another attack on Israel,\" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. Miller, speaking at a press briefing, did not say definitively whether or not Washington's messages have been disseminated to Iran or through which channel.\n\n\"I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and impress that point upon the government of Iran,\" he added. Blinken in his remarks also called for parties to \"break this cycle\" of violence and agree a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, despite the killing of Haniyeh, who was a key figure in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"What it comes down to really is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no,\" Blinken said. \"It is urgent that all

Urgent calls grew for foreign nationals to leave Lebanon, which would be on the front line of a regional war, as Iran and its allies readied their response to high-profile killings blamed on Israel. Agence France-Presse\n\nWASHINGTON -- US President Joe Biden held crisis talks on Monday on a potential Iranian counterattack on Israel as his administration said it was working around the clock to avoid all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nBiden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken engaged in frantic diplomacy to try to ease tensions sparked by a suspected Israeli attack that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThe president called King Abdullah II of Jordan, which helped down Iranian drones and missiles in an earlier showdown in April, while Blinken called top officials in Qatar and Egypt, the key intermediaries seeking a ceasefire in the 10-month Israel-Hamas war.\n\nREAD: Fears of Middle East war grow after Hamas leader's killing\n\n\"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message -- all parties must refrain from escalation,\" Blinken said after joining other top officials in a White House meeting.\n\n\"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza,\" said Blinken, who has also spoken since Sunday with G7 counterparts and Iraq's prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, multiple US personnel were injured in a rocket attack on a base in Iraq, adding to the already heightened regional tensions.\n\nREAD: US to deploy more warships, fighter jets to Middle East\n\nBiden had been hoping in his final months in office to end the Gaza war and work on clinching a landmark deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nInstead, he has boosted the US military presence in the Middle East in a show of strength to Iran.\n\nAfter staunchly backing Israel's war against Hamas, Biden has made clear his frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, who was involved in the ceasefire negotiations.\n\nBlinken, who has warned that Iran could strike soon, made a new pitch for Biden's ceasefire plan that would freeze fighting in Gaza and return hostages seized in the October 7 mega-attack on Israel by Hamas.\n\nA ceasefire \"will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread,\" Blinken said as he met Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\nIn a veiled allusion to US frustrations, Blinken said, \"What it really comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no.\"\n\n\"It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead,\" he said.\n\nFears of spiraling conflict\n\nBiden met in the White House's heavily secured Situation Room with his national security team including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe flew to the White House after a weekend home in Delaware, and after a kiss for First Lady Jill Biden, he headed straight into the Oval Office without commenting to reporters.\n\nThe White House said that Biden and the Jordanian king in their call \"discussed their efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal.\"\n\nKing Abdullah called for \"an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the catastrophe in Gaza\" and for \"ceasing all escalatory measures,\" according to a readout by the Jordanian royal court.\n\nIran fired directly at Israel in April, taking their long shadow war into the open following a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Syria.\n\nThe United States helped intercept the drones and missiles, and damage was minimal.\n\nBut Jordan -- in a delicate position with its large Palestinian population and a peace deal with Israel -- has insisted it does not want to be a battleground.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that in April, \"we were able to chart a path that ultimately got us through that time without tipping into a wider war.\"\n\n\"But every time you have one of these cycles of escalation, you have a risk of parties miscalculating, you have the risk of them taking actions that get out of hand,\" Miller told reporters.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

Blinken engaged in frantic diplomacy to try to ease tensions sparked by a suspected Israeli attack that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThe president called King Abdullah II

10-month Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message -- all parties must refrain from escalation,\" Blinken said after joining other top officials in a White House meeting.\n\n\"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza,\" said Blinken, who has also spoken since Sunday with G7 counterparts

strength to Iran.\n\nAfter staunchly backing Israel's war against Hamas, Biden has made clear his frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, who was involved in the ceasefire negotiations.\n\nBlinken, who has warned that Iran could strike soon, made a new pitch for Biden's ceasefire plan that would freeze fighting in Gaza and return hostages seized in the October 7 mega-attack on Israel by Hamas.\n\nA ceasefire \"will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread,\" Blinken said as he met Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\nIn a veiled allusion to US frustrations, Blinken said, \"What it really comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways

Delaware, and after a kiss for First Lady Jill Biden, he headed straight into the Oval Office without commenting to reporters.\n\nThe White House said that Biden and the Jordanian king in their call \"discussed their efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal.\"\n\nKing Abdullah called for \"an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the catastrophe in Gaza\" and for \"ceasing all escalatory measures,\" according to a readout by the Jordanian royal court.\n\nIran fired directly at Israel in April, taking their long shadow war into the open following a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Syria.\n\nThe United States helped intercept the drones and missiles, and damage was minimal.\n\nBut Jordan -- in a delicate position with its large Palestinian population and a peace deal with Israel -- has insisted it does not want to be a battleground.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that in April, \"we

The high-stakes discussions were triggered by a suspected Israeli attack that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. President Biden, along Secretary of State Antony Blinken, engaged in frantic diplomatic efforts to ease the escalating tensions. Biden reached out to King Abdullah II of Jordan, a key ally that had previously assisted in downing Iranian drones and missiles during an April confrontation. Simultaneously, Blinken made calls to top officials in Qatar and Egypt, pivotal intermediaries in seeking a ceasefire in the ongoing 10-month Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message -- all parties must refrain from escalation,\" Blinken stated following a White House meeting with other top officials. Emphasizing the importance of a ceasefire, Blinken added, \"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza.\" He had also been in communication with G7 counterparts and Iraq's prime minister since Sunday.\n\nThe urgency of the situation was underscored by a rocket attack on a U.S. base in Iraq on Monday, which resulted in injuries to multiple U.S. personnel, further heightening regional tensions.\n\nPresident Biden, who had hoped to end the Gaza war and pursue a landmark peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia in his final months in office, found himself instead bolstering the U.S. military presence in the Middle East as a show of strength against Iran. Despite his staunch support for Israel's war against Hamas, Biden expressed frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, a key figure in the ceasefire negotiations.\n\nBlinken, warning of a potential imminent Iranian strike, renewed his appeal for Biden's ceasefire plan, which aims to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the return of hostages taken during the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. \"A ceasefire will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread,\" Blinken asserted during a meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong. Highlighting the need for cooperation, he remarked, \"What it really comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no.\" He stressed the urgency of making the right choices in the coming hours and days.\n\nPresident Biden convened with his national security team, including Vice President Kamala Harris, in the White House's Situation Room. Upon returning from a weekend in Delaware, Biden headed straight into the Oval Office without addressing reporters. The White House confirmed that Biden and King Abdullah discussed efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including an immediate ceasefire and a hostage release deal. The Jordanian royal court's readout of the call emphasized the need for \"an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the catastrophe in Gaza\" and for \"ceasing all escalatory measures.\"\n\nThe backdrop of these tensions includes a direct Iranian missile attack on Israel in April, marking a significant escalation in their long-standing conflict following an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Syria. The U.S. played a critical role in intercepting the drones and missiles, minimizing the damage. However, Jordan, which maintains a delicate balance with its large Palestinian population and a peace deal with Israel, has been clear about not wanting to become a battleground.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller reflected on the April incident, noting, \"We were able to chart a path that ultimately got us through that time without tipping into a wider war.\" He warned, \"But every time you have one of these cycles of escalation, you have a risk of parties miscalculating, you have the risk of them taking actions that get out of hand.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com",

His comments followed the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which has stoked fears of a broader conflict involving Israel and Iran.\n\nFollowing the assassination, U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the situation, including potential threats from Iran and its proxies. During a briefing, officials discussed the unclear timeline of potential Iranian or Hezbollah attacks.

'around-the-clock' push against Mideast war", "body": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks on the Middle East as he meets Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong\n\nUS President Joe Biden held crisis talks on Monday on a potential Iranian counterattack on Israel as his administration said it was working around the clock to avoid all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nBiden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken engaged in frantic diplomacy to try to ease tensions sparked by a suspected Israeli attack that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThe president called King Abdullah II of Jordan, which helped down Iranian drones and missiles in an earlier showdown in April, while Blinken called top officials in Qatar and Egypt, the key intermediaries seeking a ceasefire in the 10-month Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message -- all parties must refrain from escalation,\" Blinken said after joining other top officials in a White House meeting.\n\n\"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza,\" said Blinken, who has also spoken since Sunday with G7 counterparts and Iraq's prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, multiple US personnel were injured in a rocket attack on a base in Iraq, adding to the already heightened regional tensions.\n\nBiden had been hoping in his final months in office to end the Gaza war and work on clinching a landmark deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nInstead, he has boosted the US military presence in the Middle East in a show of strength to Iran.\n\nAfter staunchly backing Israel's war against Hamas, Biden has made clear his frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, who was involved in the ceasefire negotiations.\n\nBlinken, who has warned that Iran could strike soon, made a new pitch for Biden's ceasefire plan that would freeze fighting in Gaza and return hostages seized in the October 7 mega-attack on Israel by Hamas.\n\nA ceasefire \"will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread,\" Blinken said as he met Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\nIn a veiled allusion to US frustrations, Blinken said, \"What it really comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no.\"\n\n\"It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead,\" he said.\n\n- Fears of spiraling conflict -\n\nBiden met in the White House's heavily secured Situation Room with his national security team including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe flew to the White House after a weekend home in Delaware, and after a kiss for First Lady Jill Biden, he headed straight into the Oval Office without commenting to reporters.\n\nThe White House said that Biden and the Jordanian king in their call \"discussed their efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal.\"\n\nKing Abdullah called for \"an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the catastrophe in Gaza\" and for \"ceasing all escalatory measures,\" according to a readout by the Jordanian royal court.\n\nIran fired directly at Israel in April, taking their long shadow war into the open following a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Syria.\n\nThe United States helped intercept the drones and missiles, and damage was minimal.\n\nBut Jordan -- in a delicate position with its large Palestinian population and a peace deal with Israel -- has insisted it does not want to be a battleground.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that in April, \"we were able to chart a path that ultimately got us through that time without tipping into a wider war.\"\n\n\"But every time you have one of these cycles of escalation, you have a risk of parties miscalculating, you have the risk of them taking actions that get out of hand,\" Miller told reporters.\n\ndk-sct/bjt\n\nMore from this section\n\nThe UN Acknowledges Foundation for a Drug-Free World

'around-the-clock' push against Mideast war", "body": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks on the Middle East as he meets Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong\n\nUS President Joe Biden held crisis talks on Monday on a potential Iranian counterattack on Israel as his administration said it was working around the clock to avoid all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nBiden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken engaged in frantic diplomacy to try to ease tensions sparked by a suspected Israeli attack that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThe president called King Abdullah II of Jordan, which helped down Iranian drones and missiles in an earlier showdown in April, while Blinken called top officials in Qatar and Egypt, the key intermediaries seeking a ceasefire in the 10-month Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message -- all parties must refrain from escalation,\" Blinken said after joining other top officials in a White House meeting.\n\n\"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza,\" said Blinken, who has also spoken since Sunday with G7 counterparts and Iraq's prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, multiple US personnel were injured in a rocket attack on a base in Iraq, adding to the already heightened regional tensions.\n\nBiden had been hoping in his final months in office to end the Gaza war and work on clinching a landmark deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nInstead, he has boosted the US military presence in the Middle East in a show of strength to Iran.\n\nAfter staunchly backing Israel's war against Hamas, Biden has made clear his frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, who was involved in the ceasefire negotiations.\n\nBlinken, who has warned that Iran could strike soon, made a new pitch for Biden's ceasefire plan that would freeze fighting in Gaza and return hostages seized in the October 7 mega-attack on Israel by Hamas.\n\nA ceasefire \"will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread,\" Blinken said as he met Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\nIn a veiled allusion to US frustrations, Blinken said, \"What it really comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no.\"\n\nMore from this section Putin vows support to North Korea after devastating floods Firefighter, 24, is first victim of huge west Canada blaze Duplantis soars to world record as Biles exits Paris Games with silver\n\n\"It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead,\" he said.\n\n- Fears of spiraling conflict -\n\nBiden met in the White House's heavily secured Situation Room with his national security team including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe flew to the White House after a weekend home in Delaware, and after a kiss for First Lady Jill Biden, he headed straight into the Oval Office without commenting to reporters.\n\nThe White House said that Biden and the Jordanian king in their call \"discussed their efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal.\"\n\nKing Abdullah called for \"an immediate and permanent ceasefire to end the catastrophe in Gaza\" and for \"ceasing all escalatory measures,\" according to a readout by the Jordanian royal court.\n\nIran fired directly at Israel in April, taking their long shadow war into the open following a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in Syria.\n\nThe United States helped intercept the drones and missiles, and damage was minimal.\n\nBut Jordan -- in a delicate position with its large Palestinian population and a peace deal with Israel -- has insisted it does not want to be a battleground.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that in April, \"we were able to chart a path that ultimately got us through that time without tipping into a wider war.\"\n\n\"But every time you have one of these cycles of escalation, you have a risk of parties miscalculating, you have the risk of them taking actions that get out of hand,\" Miller told reporters.\n\ndk-sct/bjt", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Crisis Discussions to Prevent Israel-Iran Conflict - Pehal News", "body": "Biden gathered in the White House's heavily fortified Situation Room with his national security team\n\nWashington:\n\nUS President Joe Biden convened emergency discussions on Monday regarding a potential Iranian retaliation against Israel as his administration stated it was laboring tirelessly to prevent a full-scale conflict in the Middle East.\n\nBiden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken participated in frantic diplomacy to alleviate tensions triggered by a suspected Israeli assault that led to the death of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThe president reached out to King Abdullah II of Jordan, who aided in downing Iranian drones and missiles in a previous confrontation in April, while Blinken contacted top officials in Qatar and Egypt, the primary mediators seeking a truce in the 10-month Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, essentially all day and night, with a very straightforward message -- all sides must avoid escalation,\" Blinken stated after joining other senior officials in a White House gathering.\n\n\"It is also crucial that we break this pattern by achieving a ceasefire in Gaza,\" said Blinken, who has also conversed with G7 counterparts and Iraq's prime minister since Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, multiple US personnel sustained injuries in a missile attack on a base in Iraq, heightening regional tensions further.\n\nBiden had been optimistic in his final months in office about ending the Gaza conflict and advancing towards securing a historic agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nInstead, he has bolstered the US military presence in the Middle East as a display of power to Iran.\n\nAfter steadfastly supporting Israel's campaign against Hamas, Biden has expressed his frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, who was involved in the ceasefire talks.\n\nBlinken, who has cautioned that Iran may strike imminently, advocated for Biden's proposed ceasefire plan that would halt the fighting in Gaza and release hostages taken during the October 7 major attack on Israel by Hamas.\n\nA ceasefire \"will create opportunities for longer-lasting peace, not only in Gaza itself, but in other regions where the conflict could spread,\" Blinken remarked during a meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\nIn a subtle reference to US concerns, Blinken remarked, \"Ultimately, it boils down to all sides finding ways to reach an agreement, rather than seeking excuses to delay or reject.\"\n\n\"It is imperative that all parties make the correct decisions in the upcoming hours and days,\" he emphasized.\n\nApprehensions of escalating conflict\n\nBiden convened with his national security team, including Vice President Kamala Harris, in the White House's heavily fortified Situation Room.\n\nHe returned to the White House after spending the weekend at home in Delaware, and after a brief greeting for First Lady Jill Biden, he proceeded directly to the Oval Office without addressing reporters.\n\nThe White House reported that Biden and the Jordanian king in their conversation \"discussed their endeavors to de-escalate regional tensions, including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release agreement.\"\n\nKing Abdullah urged for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire to halt the calamity in Gaza\" and for \"halting all provocative actions,\" according to a statement from the Jordanian royal court.\n\nIn April, Iran directly attacked Israel, bringing their longstanding shadow warfare out into the open following a strike on an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria.\n\nThe United States assisted in intercepting the drones and missiles, resulting in minimal damage.\n\nHowever, Jordan -- in a delicate position with its sizable Palestinian population and a peace accord with Israel -- has underscored its reluctance to become a battleground.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller remarked that in April, \"we managed to navigate a path that ultimately guided us through that period without descending into a broader conflict.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, every time one of these cycles of escalation occurs, there is a risk of parties misjudging, a risk of them taking actions that spiral out of control,\" Miller informed journalists.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

war in the Middle East.\n\nMr Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken engaged in frantic diplomacy to try to ease tensions sparked by a suspected Israeli attack that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThe president called King Abdullah II of Jordan, which helped down Iranian drones and missiles in an earlier showdown in April, while Mr Blinken called top officials in Qatar and Egypt, the key intermediaries seeking a ceasefire in the 10-month Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"We are engaged in intense diplomacy, pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message - all parties must refrain from escalation,\" Mr Blinken said after joining other top officials in a White House meeting.\n\n\"It's also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a ceasefire in Gaza,\" said Mr Blinken, who has also spoken since Aug 4 with G7 counterparts and Iraq's prime minister.\n\nOn Aug 5, multiple US personnel were injured in a rocket attack on a base in Iraq, adding to the already heightened regional tensions.\n\nMr Biden had been hoping in his final months in office to end the Gaza war and work on clinching a landmark deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nInstead, he has boosted the US military presence in the Middle East in a show of strength to Iran.\n\nAfter staunchly backing Israel's war against Hamas, Mr Biden has made clear his frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the killing of Haniyeh, who was involved in the ceasefire negotiations.\n\nMr Blinken, who has warned that Iran could strike soon, made a new pitch for Mr Biden's ceasefire plan that would freeze fighting in Gaza and return hostages seized in the Oct 7 mega-attack on Israel by Hamas.\n\nA ceasefire \"will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread,\" Mr Blinken said as he met Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\nIn a veiled allusion to US frustrations, Mr Blinken said: \"What it really comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say no.\"\n\n\"It is urgent that all parties make the right

All parties must take steps to ease tensions. Escalation is not in anyone's interest. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity,\" he said.\n\nThe top US diplomat also said it is \"critical\" to break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza, which would unlock possibilities for \"more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself, but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\n\"So for the United States, for many other countries, both in the region and beyond, this is our focus,\" he said. \"And what it comes down to, really, is all parties finding ways to come to an agreement, not look for reasons to delay or to say 'No.'\"\n\n\"It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead,\" he stressed.\n\nThe remarks came as tensions are running high in the Middle East after Iran vowed \"severe punishment\" against Israel for the assassination last Wednesday of Haniyeh at his residence in the Iranian capital Tehran.\n\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said Haniyeh's assassination was \"designed and executed\" by Israel with US support using a short-range projectile. His bodyguard was also killed in the attack.\n\nThe US announced Friday that it would deploy additional fighter jets and navy warships to the Middle East.\n\nHezbollah is also expected to retaliate after Israel assassinated Shukr in an airstrike on a southern suburb of Beirut on July 30.\n\nThe escalation comes amid an ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza which has killed nearly 39,600 Palestinians following Hamas's Oct. 7 attack last year that killed 1,200 Israelis.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His body is due to return to Qatar for an official funeral and burial tomorrow. (Majid Saeedi/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Joe Biden met on Monday with his national security team in anticipation of a retaliatory attack by Tehran over what it alleges was Israel's killing of a Hamas leader on its soil.\n\nThe high-level meeting in the White House Situation Room comes as the U.S. aims to cool tensions in the region sparked by the killing of top Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. The Hamas leader was killed last week during an airstrike targeting his housing in the Iranian capital of Tehran after he attended the inauguration of Iran's new president.\n\nIran has since blamed Israel for the assassination. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to retaliate against Israel over the killing.\n\nIsrael has not taken responsibility for the attack but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in response to the threats that Israel stands ready for any scenario.\n\nHaniyeh's assassination has since stoked concerns among world leaders of further conflict in the region. A senior Hezbollah commander was also killed the same week in Lebanon. Israel claimed responsibility for that attack on the Iran-backed group that is active in politics in Lebanon.\n\nThe United States continues to urge for restraint, this time following Iran's threats of retaliation. Biden earlier on Monday called the King of Jordan and discussed efforts to de-escalate regional tensions \"including through an immediate ceasefire and hostage release deal,\" according to a White House readout.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken also called his counterparts in Qatar and Egypt. Both nations play key roles in ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas.\n\n\"We are at a critical moment in the region,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said during a press briefing.\n\n\"We have been sending consistent messages through our diplomatic engagements encouraging people to communicate to the government of Iran that escalation is not in their interest and that we will defend Israel from attacks, and that escalation does not serve Iran's interest, just as it doesn't serve the interests of anyone in the region,\" Miller added.\n\nThe United States has beefed up its military presence in the Middle East by sending fighter jets and warships to the region in anticipation of an attack, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The defense secretary said he spoke with his Israeli officials to reiterate U.S. support for Israel's right to self-defense against threats posed by Iran and other Iranian-backed terrorist groups.\n\n\"I discussed U.S. defensive force posture moves, the focus on protecting U.S. forces, and stressed the importance of ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region. I expressed my support for a Gaza ceasefire deal that brings the hostages home,\" the defense secretary wrote in a statement on X.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, also attended Monday's crisis talks, according to the White House.\n\nThe State Department has declined to provide a timeframe of when the United States expects Iran could retaliate.",

Markwayne Mullin, (R-Okla.), said a stronger posture against Iran is something the U.S. can and should do.\n\n\"The snake is Iran, and that head needs to be cut off,\" Mullin said on CNN's State of the Union Sunday.\n\nMullin praised the Pentagon announcement saying it moved \"significant assets\" to the region.\n\n\"I'm glad that they're positioning our carriers and our fighters in the right places,\" he said. \"However, they need to know that we're willing to use it.\"\n\nThe Biden administration reiterated its commitment to helping Israel defend itself.", "source": {"uri": "dcnewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DC News Now | Washington, DC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessi_turnure@dcnewsnow.com", "name": "Jessi Turnure", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markwayne_Mullin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Markwayne Mullin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.dcnewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/08/AP23347832600153-e1722891653669.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789186", "eventUri": "eng-9789186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

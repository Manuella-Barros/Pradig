Thunberg refused to comment on why she had joined a protest in Malmo against Israel's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. The climate activist said she was \"good\" as a march took place across the Swedish city on Thursday.\n\nREAD MORE: Bambie Thug reveals order by EBU to remove pro-Palestine messages from costume at last minute\n\nDuring the demonstrations, smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off and protesters, some of whom had dogs, young children and bicycles with them, were carrying signs displaying images of Gaza civilians who have been injured amid the Hamas-Israel conflict.\n\nAt one point, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators were told to go back by police and, following shouts of \"free Palestine\", returned to the main gathering. There was also a banner in the style of Eurovision with the words \"genocide\" on it, an accusation vigorously denied by Israel amid the war with Hamas.\n\nDuring Eden Golan's rehearsals of her song, Hurricane, which was reworked from an earlier track, October Rain, thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas, she was booed and there were reportedly shouts of \"free Palestine\" on Wednesday.\n\nAt the protests in Malmo, Rory Flynn, 27, from Kildare, told the PA news agency he is from the Eurovision Irish fan club and has started a \"separate movement\" to protest against Israel, adding the country's entry in Sweden is \"overshadowing the competition\".\n\nHe said: \"We feel that it's important to make our voices heard in the competition in the arena. Others are doing a full boycott - and full respect to people who are doing a full boycott - but we think it's important that our voices are heard in the arena and around Malmo.\"\n\nMr Flynn also said his group booed during Golan's dress rehearsals this week, adding: \"This song is a propaganda song. OK, it was originally called October Rain and now it's called Hurricane, you can see there, it's the same melody; the lyrics have been changed at the request of the EBU (European Broadcast Union), but it is the same song.\n\n\"And it is about justifying Israel's genocide in Gaza, and I think that says it all really, you know, I think it's quite appropriate to kind of boo that propaganda.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Others are doing a full boycott - and full respect to people who are doing a full boycott - but we think it's important that our voices are heard in the arena and around Malmo.\"\n\nMr Flynn also said his group booed during Golan's dress rehearsals this week, adding: \"This song is a propaganda song. OK, it was originally called October Rain and now it's called Hurricane, you can see there, it's the same melody; the lyrics have been changed at the request of the EBU (European Broadcast Union), but it is the same song.\n\n\"And it is about justifying Israel's genocide in Gaza, and I think that says it all really, you know, I think it's quite appropriate to kind of boo that propaganda.\"\n\nFellow Irishman Kieran O'Casey, 71, from Dublin, said he was not a Eurovision fan, but was in Malmo to make a stance against the bombing in Gaza.\n\n\"I'm not a hardliner that they (Ireland) should have totally boycotted,\" he added.\n\n\"I don't think Israel should have been allowed to participate, not in the face of Israel's behaviour.\n\n\"There's no way because in a way, it's a kind of, it's an acceptance you can do what you want but we're gonna be pals and sing songs and wear glittery clothes while the bombing was going on. You know, it's obscene.\"\n\nProtesters marched across the city to Molleplatsen Park, with the crowd stretching around a mile long.\n\nMalmo-born Adam, who would not give his surname, told PA that the demonstrators were not \"against Israelis\" but the country's \"politics\".\n\nHe also said that there are \"protests\" against Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking place in the Middle

Drums rang out and smoke from flares billowed as calls to \"Free Free Palestine\" were heard in different languages.\n\nIt follows campaigns across Europe calling on the European Broadcasting Union to exclude Israel from the competition due to the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nChants of \"dirty, dirty competition, Israel out of Eurovision\" could be heard as the demonstration made its way to M\u00f6lleplatsen in the centre of the city. They were followed closely by police on foot, in vans and motorbikes while helicopters and drones swarmed above them.\n\nAlthough there has been a sizeable police presence around Malm\u00f6's Eurovision venue all week, police reinforcements have been called in from neighbouring countries, Denmark and Norway.\n\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, 21, was at the Stop Israel demonstration, between Stortorget and Molleplatsen.\n\nShe was wearing a keffiyeh, a material commonly used to show support for Palestine, around her body in the centre of the crowd.\n\nDuring the demonstrations, smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off and protesters, some of whom have dogs, young children and bicycles with them, were carrying signs displaying images of Gaza civilians who have been injured amid the Hamas-Israel conflict.\n\nAt one point, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators were told to go back by police and, following shouts of \"free Palestine\", returned to the main gathering.\n\nThere was also a banner done in the style of Eurovision with the words \"genocide\" on it, an accusation vigorously denied by Israel amid the war with Hamas.\n\nAt a dress rehearsal in Malm\u00f6 Arena on Wednesday, Israeli artist Eden Golan was met with boos and shouts of \"Free Palestine\" from some members of the audience.\n\nThe country originally submitted a ballad called October Rain for this year's contest, widely thought to reference the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. However, the entry was barred on the grounds of breaking rules on political neutrality.\n\nIsrael's public broadcaster Kan, responsible for choosing the country's entry, later agreed to amend the song following the Israeli president Isaac Herzog's call for \"necessary adjustments\" to ensure it could take part.\n\nThe revised song, now titled, \"Hurricane,\" replaced the original lyrics \"There's no air left to breathe\" and \"They were all good children, each one of them,\" with \"Every day I'm losing my mind\" and \"I'm still broken from this Hurricane.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Broadcast Union continues to hold the position that the contest remains a non-political event that unites audiences around the world through music.\n\nA Eurovision fan from Ireland has defended booing the Israeli singer. Rory Flynn, 27, from Kildare, told the PA news agency he is from the Eurovision Irish fan club and has started a \"separate movement\" to protest against Israel, adding the country's entry in Sweden is \"overshadowing the competition\".\n\nHe said: \"We feel that it's important to make our voices heard in the competition in the arena. Others are doing a full boycott -- and full respect to people who are doing a full boycott -- but we think it's important that our voices are heard in the arena and around Malmo.\"\n\nMr Flynn also said his group booed during Golan's dress rehearsals this week, adding: \"This song is a propaganda song. OK, it was originally called October Rain and now it's called Hurricane, you can see there, it's the same melody; the lyrics have been changed at the request of the EBU (European Broadcast Union), but it is the same song.\n\n\"And it is about justifying Israel's genocide in Gaza, and I think that says it all really, you know, I think it's quite appropriate to kind of boo that propaganda.\"",

Since then, Israeli attacks on the coastal territory have resulted in over 34,000 deaths.\n\nSome 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city for the annual kitsch-fest, which is taking place amid the protests and boycotts over the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, which this weeked moved into the city of Rafa.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition.\n\nPolice are guarding the venue and visitors need to pass through metal detectors before entering the arena.\n\nBags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses.\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security and are bracing for possible unrest, and there was a significant police presence in the square, live footage showed.\n\nDuring Eden Golan's rehearsals of her song Hurricane, which was reworked from an early track October Rain (thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas), she was booed and there were reportedly shouts of 'free Palestine' on Wednesday.\n\nOne person wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: 'The atmosphere inside the arena was horrible. You could feel the tension. Shouts of 'free Palestine' in the quiet parts. Booing audible in places. People arguing in the standing section.'\n\nAnother person, who posted a video of boos raining down on the singer, added: 'The atmosphere was so uncomfortable.'\n\nDenmark, Finland, Norway and even host country Sweden have repeatedly called for Israel to be banned from the contest altogether.

But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews,' he added.\n\nPolice estimate that about 5,000 people attended the demonstration. 'Overall, it's calm, we've turned away a few people,' a police spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nA demonstrator displays a poster during a protest against Israeli participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, ahead of the second semi-final, in Malmo Sweden, May 9, 2024\n\nProtesters carry a giant Palestinian flag in Malmo, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024\n\nA pro-Israel demonstration is also scheduled for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nThere is high security around the delegations from all the countries, according to Malmo police. 'We're keeping a bit of an extra eye on Israel of course, because of the situation,' Lotta Svensson, a police incident commander, told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe EBU, which organises the event, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song 'October Rain'.\n\nDespite the fears over her safety, Ms Golan says she has received a lot of support and hasn't seen any negative comments about her previous song October Rain.\n\nCommentators thought some of the original lyrics, like 'There is no air left to breathe' and 'They were all good children, every one of them', were about victims of the Hamas attack and therefore was deemed too political.\n\n'I was kind of shocked when the European Broadcasting Union didn't approve the song,' Ms Golan said.\n\n'I don't think the first version was political. The song is about a girl going through her own problems, her own emotions. It wasn't anything to do with October 7.'\n\nAt first, the Israeli state-owned TV network Kan, which supplied the song, said it would rather Eden dropped out of the competition than change the lyrics.\n\nIt was only after an intervention by the country's President Isaac Herzog, who called for the 'necessary adjustments', that it relented.\n\nMs Golan told the Mail that the controversy 'caught me off guard'.\n\nShe said: 'I was shocked and confused. But when they said we had to change the lyrics, I said: 'Let's do everything possible to make it happen.'\n\n'I feel like us participating in Eurovision this year is very important, and has much more meaning than any other year.'\n\nAfter several revisions, October Rain was renamed as Hurricane and now tells the story of a woman emerging from a personal crisis.\n\nMusically, it's the same song but the lyrics are more generic, the references to the massacre replaced with phrases like 'every day, I'm losing my mind' and 'I'm still broken from this hurricane'.\n\nThe end of the song, which Golan sings in Hebrew, has also been altered.\n\nThe original pay-off, which had references to poisoned air and dead children have been changed to: 'No need for big words, only prayers. Even if it's hard to see, you always leave me one small light.'\n\nMs Golan (pictured here during her second dress rehearsal) has been targeted by death threats for taking part in the show\n\nThe 20-year-old arrived in host city Malmo, in Sweden, on Tuesday afternoon for rehearsals and will reportedly be under round-the-clock bodyguard protection\n\nThe singer - who arrived in the city last week sporting a yellow pin, symbolising support for the release of hostages held by Hamas - insists that she is safe in Malmo despite the threats against her.\n\n'I'm getting a lot of love and support from my family and from the professional team that has become like a family.'\n\nShe added: 'Protests are of course not pleasant,but I can't wait to be there on stage and try to make people feel something in the three minutes that I have. I'm very focused in my mission.'\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 1900 GMT and will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He stated: \"We feel that it's important to make our voices heard in the competition in the arena. Others are doing a full boycott and full respect to people who are doing a full boycott but we think it's important that our voices are heard in the arena and around Malmo.\"\n\nFlynn also revealed that his group booed during Israeli contestant Golan's dress rehearsals, criticising the entry by saying: \"This song is a propaganda song. OK, it was originally called October Rain and now it's called Hurricane, you can see there, it's the same melody; the lyrics have been changed at the request of the EBU (European Broadcast Union), but it is the same song.\"\n\nHe further added, condemning the message behind the song: \"And it is about justifying Israel's genocide in Gaza, and I think that says it all really, you know, I think it's

Since then, Israeli attacks on the coastal territory have resulted in over 34,000 deaths and a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nSome 100,000 visitors had already gathered in the southern Swedish city for the annual kitsch-fest, which is taking place amid the protests and boycotts over the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, which this weekend moved into the city of Rafa despite protests from Israel's allies - including its most important partner the United States.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, the final of which will take place on Saturday.\n\nPolice are guarding the venue and visitors need to pass through metal detectors before entering the arena.\n\nBags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses, with organisers concerned political demonstrations could take place in the crowd.\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security and are bracing for possible unrest, and there was a significant police presence in the square, live footage showed.\n\nDuring Eden Golan's rehearsals of her song Hurricane, which was reworked from an early track October Rain (thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas), she was booed and there were reportedly shouts of 'free Palestine' on Wednesday.\n\nOne person wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: 'The atmosphere inside the arena was horrible.

And in Belgium, two Ministers demanded that the Jewish state be treated the same as Russia, which has been barred since 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGolan, who was born in Israel but grew up in Russia, has faced death threats ahead of her performances at the Malmo Arena.\n\nThe 20-year-old singer says she hopes her performance will help to unite people, and she has remained defiant in the build up to the semi-final.\n\n'I won't let anything break me,' she told MailOnline in an interview this week.

Others are doing a full boycott - and full respect to people who are doing a full boycott - but we think it's important that our voices are heard in the arena and around Malmo.'\n\nMr Flynn also said his group booed during Golan's dress rehearsals this week, adding: 'This song is a propaganda song.\n\n'OK, it was originally called October Rain and now it's called Hurricane, you can see there, it's the same melody; the lyrics have been changed at the request of the EBU (European Broadcast Union), but it is the same song.\n\n'And it is about justifying Israel's genocide in Gaza, and I think that says it all really, you know, I think it's quite appropriate to kind of boo that propaganda.'\n\nProtester Kasia Wiatrowska, from Malmo, wore a green T-shirt with the words 'Libre Palestine' on the back.\n\n'I do like Eurovision,' Wiatrowska told Reuters. 'We all love music. But this year music is dividing people, and I don't like that,' she added.\n\nAnother protester, Palestinian Amar, who only gave one name, said: 'I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.'\n\n'We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews,' he added.\n\nPolice estimate that about 5,000 people attended the demonstration. 'Overall, it's calm, we've turned away a few people,' a police spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nProtesters carry a giant Palestinian flag in Malmo, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024\n\nPeople carry a banner and wave Palestinian flags during a Pro-Palestinian demonstration for excluding Israel from Eurovision ahead of the second semi-final at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024\n\nDemonstrators hold banners during a protest against Israeli participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, ahead of the second semi-final, in Malmo Sweden, May 9, 2024\n\nPeople carry Palestinians flags as they protest against Israeli participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, ahead of the second semi-final, in Malmo Sweden, May 9, 2024\n\nSecurity guards take a Palestinian flag and lead a person from the audience out during Israel's performance in the preview of the second semi-final of this year's song contest\n\nA protester holds a Palestinian keffiyeh during Israel's performance during the preview for the second semi-final of the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) at Malmo Arena\n\nA pro-Israel demonstration is also scheduled for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nThere is high security around the delegations from all the countries, according to Malmo police. 'We're keeping a bit of an extra eye on Israel of course, because of the situation,' Lotta Svensson, a police incident commander, told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe EBU, which organises the event, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song 'October Rain'.\n\nDespite the fears over her safety, Ms Golan says she has received a lot of support and hasn't seen any negative comments about her previous song October Rain.\n\nCommentators thought some of the original lyrics, like 'There is no air left to breathe' and 'They were all good children, every one of them', were about victims of the Hamas attack and therefore was deemed too political.\n\n'I was kind of shocked when the European Broadcasting Union didn't approve the song,' Ms Golan said.\n\n'I don't think the first version was political. The song is about a girl going through her own problems, her own emotions. It wasn't anything to do with October 7.'\n\nAt first, the Israeli state-owned TV network Kan, which supplied the song, said it would rather Eden dropped out of the competition than change the lyrics.\n\nIt was only after an intervention by the country's President Isaac Herzog, who called for the 'necessary adjustments', that it relented.\n\nMs Golan told the Mail that the controversy 'caught me off guard'.\n\nShe said: 'I was shocked and confused. But when they said we had to change the lyrics, I said: 'Let's do everything possible to make it happen.'\n\n'I feel like us participating in Eurovision this year is very important, and has much more meaning than any other year.'\n\nAfter several revisions, October Rain was renamed as Hurricane and now tells the story of a woman emerging from a personal crisis.\n\nMusically, it's the same song but the lyrics are more generic, the references to the massacre replaced with phrases like 'every day, I'm losing my mind' and 'I'm still broken from this hurricane'.\n\nThe end of the song, which Golan sings in Hebrew, has also been altered.\n\nThe original pay-off, which had references to poisoned air and dead children have been changed to: 'No need for big words, only prayers. Even if it's hard to see, you always leave me one small light.'\n\nMs Golan (pictured here during her second dress rehearsal) has been targeted by death threats for taking part in the show\n\nThe 20-year-old arrived in host city Malmo, in Sweden, on Tuesday afternoon for rehearsals and will reportedly be under round-the-clock bodyguard protection\n\nThe singer - who arrived in the city last week sporting a yellow pin, symbolising support for the release of hostages held by Hamas - insists that she is safe in Malmo despite the threats against her.\n\n'I'm getting a lot of love and support from my family and from the professional team that has become like a family.'\n\nShe added: 'Protests are of course not pleasant,but I can't wait to be there on stage and try to make people feel something in the three minutes that I have. I'm very focused in my mission.'\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 1900 GMT and will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She refused to comment on why she had joined the protest, only saying it was 'good' as the march took place.\n\nDuring the demonstrations, smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off and protesters, some of whom have dogs, young children and bicycles with them, were carrying signs displaying images of Gaza civilians who have been injured amid the Hamas-Israel conflict.\n\nOther banners displayed messages including 'welcome to Genocide song contest' and 'stop using Eurovision to whitewash Israeli crimes'.\n\nAt one point, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators were told to go back by police and, following shouts of 'free Palestine', returned to the main gathering.\n\nThere was also a banner done in the style of Eurovision with the words 'genocide' on it, an accusation vigorously denied by Israel amid the country's war with Hamas, sparked by the terror group's October 7 attack last year.\n\nThe Hamas attack saw some 1,200 people in Israel killed and around 250 kidnapped by gunmen and taken back into Gaza. Since then, Israeli attacks on the coastal territory have resulted in over 34,000 deaths and a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nEden Golan of Israel celebrates gaining a place in the final during the second semi-final at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo\n\nThe song Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, believed to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel\n\nGolan holds an Israel flag to the crowds during the announcements in the semi-final\n\nSome 100,000 visitors had already gathered in the southern Swedish city for the annual kitsch-fest, which is taking place amid the protests and boycotts over the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, which this weekend moved into the city of Rafa despite protests from Israel's allies - including its most important partner the United States.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, the final of which will take place on Saturday.\n\nPolice are guarding the venue and visitors need to pass through metal detectors before entering the arena.\n\nBags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses, with organisers concerned political demonstrations could take place in the crowd.\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security and are bracing for possible unrest, and there was a significant police presence in the square, live footage showed.\n\nDuring Eden Golan's rehearsals of her song Hurricane, which was reworked from an early track October Rain (thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas), she was booed and there were reportedly shouts of 'free Palestine' on Wednesday.\n\nOne person wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: 'The atmosphere inside the arena was horrible. You could feel the tension. Shouts of 'free Palestine' in the quiet parts. Booing audible in places. People arguing in the standing section.'\n\nAnother person, who posted a video of boos raining down on the singer, added: 'The atmosphere was so uncomfortable.'\n\nIsraeli Eurovision singer Eden Golan was ordered to stay in her hotel room by her country's national security agency as thousands of pro-Palestine protesters demonstrated in Malmo, calling for her to be excluded from the competition\n\nGreta Thunberg (pictured) joined the thousands protesters in the southern Swedish city demonstrating against Israel competing in the famous song contest\n\nProtesters hold a banner reading 'Welcome to Genocide song contest' in Malmo today\n\nDenmark, Finland, Norway and even host country Sweden have repeatedly called for Israel to be banned from the contest altogether. And in Belgium, two Ministers demanded that the Jewish state be treated the same as Russia, which has been barred since 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGolan, who was born in Israel but grew up in Russia, has faced death threats ahead of her performances at the Malmo Arena.\n\nThe 20-year-old singer says she hopes her performance will help to unite people, and she has remained defiant in the build up to the semi-final.\n\n'I won't let anything break me,' she told MailOnline in an interview this week. 'I wouldn't say I'm worried. I'm prepared.'\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, she said: 'It's a super important moment for us, especially this year. I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.'\n\n'I won't let anything break me,' Eden Golan told MailOnline in an interview this week (pictured). 'I wouldn't say I'm worried. I'm prepared'\n\nFootage showed members of the crowd booing and shouting during Eden Golan's performance on Wednesday night\n\nGolan has been the target for pro-Palestine protesters who believe Israel should have been thrown out of this year's competition\n\nA Palestine flag is waved during Golan's performance of her song 'Hurricane' during the semi-final of the competition last night\n\nThe original iteration of Golan's piano-backed ballad Hurricane was called October Rain and was a barely disguised tribute to the victims of the Hamas terrorist attack last year\n\nAt the protests in Malmo, Rory Flynn, 27, from Kildare, told the PA news agency he is from the Eurovision Irish fan club.\n\nRead More Moment Israeli singer Eden Golan's Eurovision performance is nearly drowned out by boos and chants of 'Free Palestine' in chaotic scenes\n\nHe said he has started a 'separate movement' to protest against Israel, adding the country's entry in Sweden is 'overshadowing the competition'.\n\nHe said: 'We feel that it's important to make our voices heard in the competition in the arena. Others are doing a full boycott - and full respect to people who are doing a full boycott - but we think it's important that our voices are heard in the arena and around Malmo.'\n\nMr Flynn also said his group booed during Golan's dress rehearsals this week, adding: 'This song is a propaganda song.\n\n'OK, it was originally called October Rain and now it's called Hurricane, you can see there, it's the same melody; the lyrics have been changed at the request of the EBU (European Broadcast Union), but it is the same song.\n\n'And it is about justifying Israel's genocide in Gaza, and I think that says it all really, you know, I think it's quite appropriate to kind of boo that propaganda.'\n\nProtester Kasia Wiatrowska, from Malmo, wore a green T-shirt with the words 'Libre Palestine' on the back.\n\n'I do like Eurovision,' Wiatrowska told Reuters. 'We all love music. But this year music is dividing people, and I don't like that,' she added.\n\nAnother protester, Palestinian Amar, who only gave one name, said: 'I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.'\n\n'We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews,' he added.\n\nPolice estimate that about 5,000 people attended the demonstration. 'Overall, it's calm, we've turned away a few people,' a police spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nProtesters carry a giant Palestinian flag in Malmo, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024\n\nPeople carry a banner and wave Palestinian flags during a Pro-Palestinian demonstration for excluding Israel from Eurovision ahead of the second semi-final at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024\n\nDemonstrators hold banners during a protest against Israeli participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, ahead of the second semi-final, in Malmo Sweden, May 9, 2024\n\nPeople carry Palestinians flags as they protest against Israeli participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, ahead of the second semi-final, in Malmo Sweden, May 9, 2024\n\nSecurity guards take a Palestinian flag and lead a person from the audience out during Israel's performance in the preview of the second semi-final of this year's song contest\n\nA protester holds a Palestinian keffiyeh during Israel's performance during the preview for the second semi-final of the 68th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) at Malmo Arena\n\nA pro-Israel demonstration is also scheduled for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nThere is high security around the delegations from all the countries, according to Malmo police. 'We're keeping a bit of an extra eye on Israel of course, because of the situation,' Lotta Svensson, a police incident commander, told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe EBU, which organises the event, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song 'October Rain'.\n\nDespite the fears over her safety, Ms Golan says she has received a lot of support and hasn't seen any negative comments about her previous song October Rain.\n\nCommentators thought some of the original lyrics, like 'There is no air left to breathe' and 'They were all good children, every one of them', were about victims of the Hamas attack and therefore was deemed too political.\n\n'I was kind of shocked when the European Broadcasting Union didn't approve the song,' Ms Golan said.\n\n'I don't think the first version was political. The song is about a girl going through her own problems, her own emotions. It wasn't anything to do with October 7.'\n\nAt first, the Israeli state-owned TV network Kan, which supplied the song, said it would rather Eden dropped out of the competition than change the lyrics.\n\nIt was only after an intervention by the country's President Isaac Herzog, who called for the 'necessary adjustments', that it relented.\n\nMs Golan told the Mail that the controversy 'caught me off guard'.\n\nShe said: 'I was shocked and confused. But when they said we had to change the lyrics, I said: 'Let's do everything possible to make it happen.'\n\n'I feel like us participating in Eurovision this year is very important, and has much more meaning than any other year.'\n\nAfter several revisions, October Rain was renamed as Hurricane and now tells the story of a woman emerging from a personal crisis.\n\nMusically, it's the same song but the lyrics are more generic, the references to the massacre replaced with phrases like 'every day, I'm losing my mind' and 'I'm still broken from this hurricane'.\n\nThe end of the song, which Golan sings in Hebrew, has also been altered.\n\nThe original pay-off, which had references to poisoned air and dead children have been changed to: 'No need for big words, only prayers. Even if it's hard to see, you always leave me one small light.'\n\nMs Golan (pictured here during her second dress rehearsal) has been targeted by death threats for taking part in the show\n\nThe 20-year-old arrived in host city Malmo, in Sweden, on Tuesday afternoon for rehearsals and will reportedly be under round-the-clock bodyguard protection\n\nThe singer - who arrived in the city last week sporting a yellow pin, symbolising support for the release of hostages held by Hamas - insists that she is safe in Malmo despite the threats against her.\n\n'I'm getting a lot of love and support from my family and from the professional team that has become like a family.'\n\nShe added: 'Protests are of course not pleasant,but I can't wait to be there on stage and try to make people feel something in the three minutes that I have. I'm very focused in my mission.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustii",

The conflict has taken the lives of 33,000 since October. Even Greta Thunberg, 21, the famous Swedish environment activist, was part of the huge Stop Israel demonstration ahead of the show's second semi-final tonight [Thursday 9 May].\n\nIsrael's national security agency Shin Bet had warned Eden to not leave her accommodation except to perform, as the Swedish city was expecting a large crowd of protesters, according to MailOnline. She already received backlash when she put forward her song October Rain as many believed the lyrics were in reference to the militant group Hamas kidnapping and killing Israelis on October 7. In March, the song had changed to Hurricane, which was approved by the European Broadcasting Union.\n\nIsraeli singer Eden Golan set to perform in the semi-final of Eurovision Song Contest amid pro-Palestine demonstrations\n\nFive thousand people took to the streets earlier today. Speaking to the press, Greta told one publication: \"Young people are leading the way and showing the world how we should react to this.\" But she refused to be drawn in on why she had joined the protest. During the demonstrations smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off and some of the protesters were holding up placards with images of Gaza civilians who have been injured due to the Hamas-Israel conflict.\n\nOther banners held up, had the message that read: \"Welcome to Genocide song contest\". And another read: \"Stop using Eurovision to whitewash Israeli crimes.\" The Hamas attack in October saw 1,200 people in Israel killed and an estimated 250 people kidnapped by gunmen and taken back into Gaza. Since then the retaliation attacks have resulted in more than 30,000 deaths and has caused a humanitarian outrage.\n\nGreta Thunberg was part of the pro-Palestine demonstrations\n\nIn the stadium however, it seems the tension is just as intense. Bags are being checked and visitors are reportedly only being allowed to bring small purses. One person wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"The atmosphere inside the arena was horrible. You could feel the tension. Shouts of 'free Palestine' in the quiet parts. Booing audible in places. People arguing in the standing section.\"\n\nAnd another person posted a video of boos aimed at Eden while on stage. The wrote: \"The atmosphere was so uncomfortable.\" Speaking to the MailOnline, Eden appeared defiant against the backlash to her admission into the competition. She said: \"I won't let anything break me. I wouldn't say I'm worried. I'm prepared.\" And speaking to news agency Reuters, She also said: \"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year. I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nMirror Online has reached out to Eden Golan's reps for comment.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucretia_munro@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lucretia Munro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Garden of Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greta Thunberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MailOnline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32775052.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Israeli-Eurovision-star-Eden-Golan-urged-to-stay-in-hotel-room-by-security-as-pro-Palestine-protest.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553661", "eventUri": "eng-9553661", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 716, "textEnd": 721}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1104, "textEnd": 1113}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

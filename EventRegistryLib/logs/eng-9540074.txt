The incident occurred in the parking lot of a hardware store in suburban Willetton on Saturday night.\n\nThe teen attacked the man and then rushed at police officers before he was shot, Western Australian Premier Roger Cook told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\"There are indications he had been radicalised online,\" Cook told a news conference.\n\n\"But I want to reassure the community at this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone,\" Cook added.\n\nA man in his 30s was found at the scene with a stab wound to his back. He was taken to a hospital in serious but stable condition, a police statement said.\n\nPolice and Australian Security Intelligence Organization agents have been conducting a counterterrorism investigation in the east coast city of Sydney since another 16-year-old boy stabbed an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest in a church on April 15.\n\nThat boy has been charged with committing a terrorist act. Six of his alleged associates have also been charged with a range of offenses, including conspiring to engage in or planning a terrorist act. All remain in custody.\n\n'No ongoing threat to the community'\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the latest stabbing in Perth by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw and ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess, who heads the nation's main domestic spy agency.\n\n\"I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available,\" Albanese said.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" he added.\n\nPolice received an emergency phone call after 22:00 from a teenager saying he was going to commit acts of violence, Western Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch said.\n\nThe boy had been participating in a programme for young people at risk of radicalisation, Blanch added.\n\n\"I don't want to say he has been radicalised or is radicalised because I think that forms part of the investigation,\" he said.\n\nPolice said they were later alerted by a phone call from a member of the public that a knife attack was underway in the parking lot. Three police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with conducted energy devices.\n\nPolice deployed both conducted energy devices but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nBlanch said members of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behaviour before he was killed on Saturday.\n\nThe Imam of Perth's largest mosque, the Nasir Mosque, condemned the stabbing.\n\n\"There is no place for violence in Islam,\" Imam Syed Wadood Janud said in a statement.\n\n\"We appreciate the effort of the police to keep our communities safe. I also want to commend the local Muslim community who had flagged the individual prior with the police,\" Wadood added.\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticised Australian police for declaring last month's church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded.\n\nThe 40-year-old attacker in the mall attack was shot dead by police. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.\n\nThe church attack is only the third to be classified by Australian authorities as a terrorist act since 2018.\n\nIn December 2022, three Christian fundamentalists shot dead two police officers and a bystander in an ambush near the community of Wieambilla in Queensland state. The shooters were later killed by police.\n\nIn November 2018, a Somalia-born Muslim stabbed three pedestrians in downtown Melbourne, killing one, before police shot him dead.", "source": {"uri":

He was taken to a hospital in serious but stable condition, a police statement said.\n\nThe teen attacked the man and then rushed at police officers before he was shot, Western Australian Premier Roger Cook told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\"At this stage, it appears that he acted solely and alone,\" Cook told a televised press conference in the state capital Perth, regarding the attacker.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the incident by police and intelligence agencies, which advised there was no ongoing threat.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" Albanese said on social media platform X.\n\nPolice received an emergency phone call after 10 p.m. from a teenager saying he was going to commit acts of violence, Western Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch said.\n\nThe boy had been participating in a program for young people at risk of radicalization, Blanch added.\n\n\"I don't want to say he has been radicalized or is radicalized because I think that forms part of the investigation,\" he said.\n\nPolice body camera images showed the teenager refused officers' demands that he put down the knife, the police chief said.\n\nThe weapon was a 30-centimeter (one-foot) kitchen knife, believed to be from the attacker's home, Blanch said.\n\nOfficers fired two Tasers at him but \"both of them did not have the full desired effect,\" he said.\n\n\"The male continued to advance on the third officer with a firearm who fired a single shot and fatally wounded the male.\"\n\nThe teenager died in the hospital later in the night, he said.\n\nPolice believe the teenager sent \"relevant messages\" to some members of the Muslim community who immediately called police, Blanch said, without giving details of the messages.\n\nThe boy had \"mental issues but also online radicalization issues,\" the police chief said.\n\nIn the past two years, the attacker had been part of a \"countering violence extremism program\" for people who show signs of \"religious or issues-motivated\" concerns, he said.\n\n\"It is not a criminal-based approach but it is a program to help individuals who are expressing ideologies that are of concern in our community. But they may not be committing any crimes.\"\n\nPolice said they did not know what had triggered the attack.\n\nThe imam of Perth's largest mosque, the Nasir Mosque, condemned the stabbing.\n\n\"There is no place for violence in Islam,\" Imam Syed Wadood Janud said in a statement.\n\n\"We appreciate the effort of the police to keep our communities safe. I also want to commend the local Muslim community who had flagged the individual prior with the police,\" Wadood added.\n\nThe incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offenses in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.\n\nThe attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.\n\nGun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the

The teenager died in hospital later in the night, he said.\n\nPolice body camera images showed the teenager refused officers' demands that he put down the knife, the police chief said.\n\nNOT \"TERRORIST ATTACK\" AT THIS STAGE\n\nPolice have confirmed the boy had been part of an online programme for the last few years aimed at young people \"exhibiting behaviours that are it might be religious or issues motivated concerns\".\n\n\"It is not a criminal-based approach,\" said Blanch. \"But it is a programme to help individuals who are expressing ideologies that are of concern in our community. But they may not be committing any crimes.\"\n\nPolice said they did not know what had triggered the attack.\n\nHowever, Blanch said the incident was not being labelled as a terrorist attack at this stage, while at the same time conceding that the stabbing \"certainly has the hallmarks of being one\". The boy was believed to be acting alone.\n\nAuthorities added they had received calls from concerned members of the local Muslim community before the attack.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed by police and intelligence services who had advised there was no \"ongoing threat\".\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" he said in a message on social media.\n\nThe incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.\n\nThe attack on the bishop came only days after a deadly mass stabbing in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi that claimed the lives of six people.\n\nGun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

He was taken to hospital in serious, but stable, condition, a police statement said.\n\nPolice and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) agents have been conducting a counterterrorism investigation in the east coast city of Sydney after another 16-year-old boy stabbed an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest in a church on April 15.\n\nThat boy has been charged with committing a terrorist act. Six of his alleged associates have also been charged with a range of offenses, including conspiring to engage in or planning a terrorist act. All remain in custody.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the latest stabbing in Perth by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw and ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess, who heads the nation's main domestic spy agency.\n\n\"I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available,\" Albanese said.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" he added.\n\nPolice received an emergency telephone call after 10pm from a teenager saying he was going to commit acts of violence, Western Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch said.\n\nThe boy had been participating in a program for young people at risk of radicalization, Blanch added.\n\n\"I don't want to say he has been radicalized or is radicalized, because I think that forms part of the investigation,\" he said.\n\nPolice said they were later alerted by a phone call from a member of the public that a knife attack was under way in the parking lot. Three police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with conducted energy devices.\n\nPolice deployed the conducted energy devices, but failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nMembers of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behavior before he was killed on Saturday, he said.\n\nThe Imam of Perth's largest mosque, the Nasir Mosque, condemned the stabbing.\n\n\"There is no place for violence in Islam,\" Imam Syed Wadood Janud said in a statement.\n\n\"We appreciate the effort of the police to keep our communities safe. I also want to commend the local Muslim community who had flagged the individual prior with the police,\" Wadood added.\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring last month's church stabbing a terrorist act, but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded.\n\nThe 40-year-old attacker in the mall attack was shot dead by police. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.\n\nThe church attack is only the third to be classified by Australian authorities as a terrorist act since 2018.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_youth_radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online youth radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Security Intelligence Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Western_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Western Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Cook_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Cook (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reece_Kershaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reece Kershaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assyrian people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Federal Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Orthodox Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Violent extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/05/06/P05-240506-310.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540074", "eventUri": "eng-9540074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 1092, "textEnd": 1100}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

But I want to reassure the community at this stage it appears he acted solely and alone,\" Premier Roger Cook said.\n\nPolice received a call late on Saturday from a male warning that he was going to commit \"acts of violence\" but without giving his name or location, the state's police commissioner, Col Blanch, told reporters.\n\nWithin minutes, another emergency call alerted police that a \"male with a knife was running around the car park\" in Willetton, a southern suburb of Perth, he said.\n\nPolice body camera images showed the teenager refused officers' demands that he put down the knife, the police chief said.\n\nThe weapon was a 30-centimetre (one-foot) kitchen knife, believed to be from the attacker's home, he said.\n\nOfficers fired two Tasers at him but \"both of them did not have the full desired effect,\" he said.\n\n\"The male continued to advance on the third officer with a firearm who fired a single shot and fatally wounded the male.\"\n\nThe teenager died in hospital later in the night, he said.\n\nThe \"middle-aged\" man who had been stabbed was in a \"serious\" but stable condition and appeared to be doing well, the police commissioner said.\n\nThe man had suffered a single, \"possibly\" two centimetre stab wound that may have punctured a lung, he said.\n\nPolice believe the teenager sent \"relevant messages\" to some members of the Muslim community who immediately called police, he said, without giving details of the messages.\n\nThe boy had \"mental issues but also online radicalisation issues\", the police chief said.\n\nIn the past two years, the attacker had been part of a \"countering violence extremism programme\" for people who show signs of \"religious or issues-motivated\" concerns, he said.\n\n\"It is not a criminal based approach but it is a programme to help individuals who are expressing ideologies that are of concern in our community. But they may not be committing any crimes.\"\n\nPolice said they did not know what had triggered the attack.\n\nBlanch said it had the \"hallmarks\" of a terrorist incident but he was not making an official declaration right now as he had no concerns about a wider network being involved.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed by police and intelligence services who had advised there was no \"ongoing threat\".\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" he said in a message on social media.\n\nDespite the rarity of such violent crimes in Australia, the Perth attack comes less than a month after a knife-wielding assailant killed six people in a shopping mall in Sydney.\n\nThe mentally ill knifeman, 40-year-old Joel Cauchi, was tracked down, shot and killed by a police inspector.\n\nCauchi's parents say he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17 but stopped taking medication, later leaving their Queensland home and dropping out of treatment.\n\nTwo days after the mall attack an Assyrian Christian bishop was brutally stabbed during a live streamed service in western Sydney.\n\nThe bishop has since recovered and a 16-year-old suspect has been charged with committing \"a terrorist act\".", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [],

Visit image gallery to purchase the image.\n\nAuthorities say there is no ongoing threat to the public after an allegedly radicalised teenager armed with a large kitchen knife was shot dead by police in Western Australia.\n\nThe 16-year-old stabbed a man in the back at a Bunnings carpark at Willetton, in Perth's south, on Saturday night then rushed at officers, WA Police Commissioner Col Blanch told reporters on Sunday.\n\nHe said bodyworn footage of the incident shows the teen approaching police who deployed their Tasers but that did not have the \"desired effect\".\n\nThe teen then moved towards a constable who fired a single shot, Mr Blanch said.\n\nWhen officers arrived at the scene they did not know a man had been stabbed in the back in the carpark.\n\nThe victim, whose age has not been made public, is in a serious but stable condition in hospital.\n\nMr Blanch said the injured man was not connected to the teen and just happened to be in the area when he was attacked.\n\nThe police commissioner said several emergency calls triple were made about the incident, including from the teenager himself and multiple ones from members of the state's Muslim community concerned about his behaviour.\n\n\"We believe he sent relevant messages to some of those members who immediately responded by calling police,\" Mr Blanch said.\n\n\"Again, I do want to thank members of the Muslim community who did that, because that enabled us to identify rapidly who this individual was and respond quickly.\"\n\nHe described the teen involved as a Caucasian male with mental health issues who was known to police.\n\nThe boy had been part of an anti-radicalisation support programme since 2022 but police do not have concerns he is part of a wider network.\n\nOfficers have been in contact with his family.\n\n\"I think the family really do understand the situation that police were in, they are being very forthcoming with police,\" Mr Blanch said.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said there was \"indications he had been radicalised online.\"\n\n\"I want to reassure the community at this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone,\" Mr Cook said.\n\n\"Members of the WA Muslim community, who were concerned by his behaviour, contacted police prior to the incident and I thank them for their help.\n\n\"Our police responded within minutes, they encountered a very confronting situation but their rapid and professional response kept our community safe.\"\n\nMr Blanch said the constable who fired the shot and his colleagues were \"hurting\" but stressed they had done their job.\n\nThe ASIO Director-General and Australian Federal Police Commissioner have briefed Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the incident.\n\n\"I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available,\" Mr Albanese said on social media.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia.\"\n\nAn investigation will examine the shooting and events leading up to the incident.\n\nThe Imam of the Mahmood Mosque in Adelaide, who previously served in Perth, condemned the attack \"in the strongest terms\".\n\n\"We are once again saddened to learn of another knife attack in which innocent civilians were harmed, this time in Perth,\" Imam Kamran Tahir said in a statement.\n\n\"It should be made very clear that there is no justification for such acts in Islam.\"\n\nThe incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney on April 15 this year.\n\nThe attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six at a busy shopping mall in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.\n\nGun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government.", "source":

It\u00b4s an issue for our entire society, whether it be violent extremism, misogyny and violence against women. It is an issue that of course I\u00b4m concerned about,\" Albanese told reporters.\n\nWestern Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the boy had phoned police late Saturday saying he was about to commit \"acts of violence\" but did not say where. Minutes later, a member of the public reported to police seeing the boy with a knife in a hardware store parking lot.\n\nIn this image from a video, Western Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch speaks at a press conference in Perth, Australia Sunday, May 5, 2024. A 16-year-old boy armed with a knife was shot dead by police after he stabbed a man in the Australian west coast city of Perth, officials said Sunday. (Australian Broadcasting Corporation via AP)\n\nThree police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with stun guns. Police deployed both stun guns but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nThe stabbing victim is a man in his 30s who was wounded in his back. He was in serious but stable condition at a Perth hospital, police said.\n\nBlanch said members of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy\u00b4s behavior before he was killed on Saturday.\n\nPolice said the stabbing had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack but have not declared it as such. Factors that can influence that decision include whether state police need federal resources, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organization domestic spy agency.\n\nBlanch said the Western Australia Police Force investigation did not need additional federal resources and he was confidence the situation was different from the one in Sydney.\n\n\"We are dealing with complex issues, both mental health issues but also online radicalization issues,\" Blanch said Sunday. \"But we believe he very much is acting alone and we do not have concerns at this time that there is an ongoing network or other concerns that might have been seen over in Sydney.\"\n\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb had declared the stabbings of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest in a Sydney church on April 15 as a terrorist act within hours. The boy arrested was later charged with committing a terrorist act. In the subsequent investigation, six more teenagers were charged with terror-related offenses.\n\nPolice alleged all seven were part of a network that \"adhered to a religiously motivated, violent extremist ideology.\"\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring last month\u00b4s church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded. The 40-year-old attacker was shot dead by police.\n\nThe man had a history of schizophrenia and most of the victims he targeted were women. Police have yet to reveal the man\u00b4s motive.\n\nThe church attack is only the third to be classified by Australian authorities as a terrorist act since 2018.\n\nIn December 2022, three Christian fundamentalists shot dead two police officers and a bystander in an ambush near the community of Wieambilla in Queensland state. The shooters were later killed by police.\n\nIn November 2018, a Somalia-born Muslim stabbed three pedestrians in downtown Melbourne, killing one, before police shot him dead.\n\nThis image from a video, shows a parking lot where an incident occurred in Perth, Australia Sunday, May 5, 2024.

But I want to assure people that at this point it appears that he acted alone,\" Cook said.\n\nPolice received a call Saturday night from a man warning that he was going to commit \"acts of violence,\" but without giving his name or location, state police official Col Blanch told reporters.\n\nMinutes later, he added, police received an emergency call warning them that \"a man with a knife was running\" in a car park in Willetton, a suburb south of Perth.\n\nThe individual was armed with a 12-inch-long kitchen knife, and based on police body camera footage, the teen refused to put it down as police had ordered, Blanch said.\n\nThe agents fired two electric pulse guns but \"none of them had the desired effect,\" he said.\n\n\"The man continued to advance toward (an officer) with a gun, who fired a single shot and fatally wounded\" the individual, the police officer said. The teenager died in the hospital that same night.\n\nThe \"mature\" man injured by a single stab wound during the attack is in \"serious\" but stable condition, the police official said.\n\nPolice believe the teen sent messages to members of the Muslim community, who immediately notified police, they said without revealing information about their content.\n\nThe teenager had \"mental health problems but also online radicalization problems,\" according to the same source.\n\nIn recent years, the attacker was followed as part of a program to combat violence and extremism.\n\n\"This is not a crime-based approach, it is a program aimed at helping people who express ideologies that concern our community,\" Mr. Blanch explained.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese explained that the police and intelligence services had kept him informed of the events, according to which there was no \"ongoing threat.\"\n\n\"We are a nation committed to peace and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" Albanese wrote on social media.\n\nViolent crime is rare in Australia, but this incident comes less than a month after another stabbing that left six dead in a Sydney shopping center (southeast).\n\nThe perpetrator of this attack, Joel Cauchi, a 40-year-old man who suffered from mental illness, was shot dead by police. His parents said his son was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 17, then he left his home in Queensland (northeast) and abandoned treatment.\n\nTwo days after this shopping center attack, a bishop of an Assyrian church was also stabbed during a live-streamed sermon at a Sydney church. The victim survived his injuries. A 16-year-old boy has since been charged with a \"terrorist act.\"", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Cook_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Cook (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Church_of_the_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assyrian Church of the East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sermon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_4f664.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540074", "eventUri": "eng-9540074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

has not been made public, is in a serious but stable condition in hospital.\n\nBlanch said the injured man was not connected to the teen and just happened to be in the area when he was attacked.\n\nThe police commissioner said several triple zero calls were made about the incident, including from the teenager himself and multiple ones from members of the state's Muslim community concerned about his behaviour.\n\n\"We believe he sent relevant messages to some of those members who immediately responded by calling police,\" Blanch said.\n\n\"Again, I do want to thank members of the Muslim community who did that, because that enabled us to identify rapidly who this individual was and respond quickly.\"\n\nHe described the teen involved as a Caucasian male with mental health issues who was known to police.\n\nThe boy had been part of an anti-radicalisation support program since 2022 but police do not have concerns he is part of a wider network.\n\nOfficers have been in

community, who were concerned by his behaviour, contacted police prior to the incident and I thank them for their help,\" he said.\n\n\"Our police responded within minutes, they encountered a very confronting situation but their rapid and professional response kept our community safe.\"\n\nBlanch said the constable who fired the shot and his colleagues were \"hurting\" but stressed they had done their job.\n\nThe ASIO Director-General and Australian Federal Police Commissioner have briefed Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the incident.\n\n\"I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available,\" Albanese said on social media.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia.\"\n\nAn investigation will examine the shooting and events leading up to the incident.\n\nThe Imam of the Mahmood Mosque in Adelaide, who previously served in Perth, condemned the attack \"in the strongest terms\".\n\n\"We are once again saddened to learn of another knife attack in which innocent civilians were harmed, this time in Perth,\" Imam Kamran Tahir said in a statement.\n\n\"It should be made very clear that there is no

A 16-year-old boy armed with a knife was shot dead by police after he stabbed a man in the Australian west coast city of Perth, officials said Sunday. (Australian Broadcasting Corporation via AP)\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy who was shot dead by police after stabbing a man in the Australian west coast city of Perth had been in a deradicalization program but had no links to an alleged network of teen extremists in the east coast city of Sydney, authorities said.\n\nThe boy had participated in the federally funded Countering Violent Extremism program for two years but had no criminal record, Western Australia Police Minister Paul Papalia said Monday.\n\n\"The challenge we confront with people like the 16-year-old in this incident is that he's known to hold views that are dangerous and potentially he could be radicalized,\" Papalia said. \"But the problem with individuals like this is they can act at short notice without warning and be very dangerous.\"\n\nOn the potential for the boy to have been radicalized, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was concerned by social media pushing extreme positions.\n\n\"It's a dynamic that isn't just an issue for government. It's an issue for our entire society, whether it be violent extremism, misogyny and violence against women. It is an issue that of course I'm concerned about,\" Albanese told reporters.\n\nWestern Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the boy had phoned police late Saturday saying he was about to commit \"acts of violence\" but did not say where. Minutes later, a member of the public reported to police seeing the boy with a knife in a hardware store parking lot.\n\nThree police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with stun guns. Police deployed both stun guns but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nThe stabbing victim is a man in his 30s who was wounded in his back. He was in serious but stable condition at a Perth hospital, police said.\n\nBlanch said members of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behavior before he was killed on Saturday.\n\nThe boy had said in a text message to associates, \"I am going on the path of jihad tonight for the sake of Allah,\" Australian Associated Press reported, prompting several to alert police.\n\nPolice said the stabbing had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack but have not declared it as such. Factors that can influence that decision include whether state police need federal resources, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organization domestic spy agency.\n\nBlanch said the Western Australia Police Force investigation did not need additional federal resources and he was confidence the situation was different from the one in Sydney.\n\n\"We are dealing with complex issues, both mental health issues but also online radicalization issues,\" Blanch said Sunday. \"But we believe he very much is acting alone and we do not have concerns at this time that there is an ongoing network or other concerns that might have been seen over in Sydney.\"\n\nWestern Australia Premier Roger Cook said his government and the state education department had been aware of concerns at the boy's school about his behavior. Cook didn't directly respond to reports that several boys at Rossmoyne Senior High School, the prestigious government school he attended, were attempting to radicalize classmates.\n\n\"I'll leave that up the the Education Department to clarify,\" Cook told reporters. \"This young man was harboring some extremist thoughts, which is the reason why he was part of the Countering Violent Extremism program.\"\n\nAmanda Spencer-Teo, a parent of a Rossmoyne student, said multiple \"red flags\" had been raised about the behavior of some students.\n\n\"Parents have been raising this with the school for some time,\" Spencer-Teo, who will be an opposition party candidate at state elections next year, told The Australian newspaper. \"The school and the department have failed to provide information to those concerned parents.\"\n\nIn the stabbings at a Sydney church on April 15, New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb declared the stabbings of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest as a terrorist act within hours. The boy arrested was later charged with committing a terrorist act. In the subsequent investigation, six more teenagers were charged with terror-related offenses.\n\nPolice alleged all seven were part of a network that \"adhered to a religiously motivated, violent extremist ideology.\"\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring the church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded.\n\nThe 40-year-old attacker, who was shot dead by police, had a history of schizophrenia and most of the victims he targeted were women. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The incident reportedly took place along High Street before 11.30pm local time on May 4.\n\nAccording to reports from WAMN News on May 5, a police operation was mobilised. Witnesses described a chaotic scene where a man wielding a long knife chased individuals on the street.\n\nNews.com.au reported that the 16-year-old suspect is a Caucasian armed with what is believed to be a 30cm-long kitchen knife. He called the police to the carpark outside Bunnings Willeton on May 4 around 10pm after stabbing a man in the back, the police said. Authorities said the victim, who was stabbed in the back, was in the hospital and in stable condition.\n\nPolice Commissioner Col Blanch said the officers instructed him to put the knife down. When he refused to do so and lunged at them with his weapon, two officers tasered him while a third shot him.\n\nImages from police body camera showed the teenager refused officers' demands that he put down the knife, the police chief said.\n\nThe teenager died in hospital later in the night, he said.\n\nCommissioner Blanch said the boy, who had \"mental health issues\", was known to the police. He also appeared to be a part of a programme about \"online radicalisation\".\n\nEarlier, Western Australia Premier Roger Cook had said: \"There are indications he had been radicalised online.\"\n\n\"But I want to reassure the community at this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone,\" he added.\n\n\"Members of the WA Muslim community, who were concerned by his behaviour, contacted police prior to the incident and I thank them for their help. Our police responded within minutes.\"\n\nAt about 10pm on May 4, the police received a call from a male who said he was going to commit \"acts of violence\", ABC News reported.\n\nIn a press conference on May 5, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese thanked the Western Australian police for their swift action to contain the incident and said his \"thoughts are with those who have been affected by the incident\".\n\nHe said: \"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia.\"\n\nA family member of a witness, who was not named, recounted the harrowing experience to WAMN News. Her brother-in-law was chased by a man with a long knife, she said.\n\n\"After working out, he waited at the door for his friends, and then a man approached him with a knife,\" she added. The attacker reportedly shouted religious phrases before pursuing her brother-in-law, who managed to escape. The assailant then turned his attention to another group of people, attacking one of them.\n\nThe Perth attack comes weeks after a stabbing spree in a Sydney mall on April 13 which left six people dead and a knife attack in a church two days later which left at least four people, including a bishop, wounded.\n\nThe suspect in the mall attack was shot and killed by a lone female police officer, who happened to be nearby.\n\nA 16-year-old boy was charged with a terrorism offence for the knifing of Assyrian Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel during a live-streamed church service on April 15. An Australian counter-terrorism team arrested seven teenagers on April 24 who were linked to him. - The Straits Times/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News.com.au", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News.com.au"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Cook_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Cook (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_New_South_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier of New South Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assyrian people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/05/05/2677852.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540074", "eventUri": "eng-9540074", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 349, "textEnd": 354, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 396, "textEnd": 401, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-13", "textStart": 2884, "textEnd": 2892}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 3290, "textEnd": 3298}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 3365, "textEnd": 3373}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

"Authorities say there is no ongoing threat to the public after an allegedly radicalised teenager armed with a large kitchen knife was shot dead by police in Western Australia.\n\nThe 16-year-old stabbed a man in the back at a Bunnings carpark at Willetton in Perth's south on Saturday night then rushed at officers, WA Police Commissioner Col Blanch told reporters on Sunday.\n\nHe said bodyworn footage of the incident shows the teen approaching police who deployed their Tasers but that did not have the \"desired effect\".\n\nThe teen then moved towards a constable who fired a single shot, Mr Blanch said.\n\nWhen officers arrived at the scene they did not know a man had been stabbed in the back in the carpark.\n\nThe stabbed man, whose age has not been made public, is in a serious but stable condition in hospital.\n\nMr Blanch said the injured man was not connected to the teen and just happened to be in the area when he was attacked.\n\nThe police commissioner said several triple zero calls were made about the incident, including from the teenager himself and multiple ones from members of the state's Muslim community concerned about his behaviour.\n\n\"We believe he sent relevant messages to some of those members who immediately responded by calling police,\" Mr Blanch said.\n\n\"Again, I do want to thank members of the Muslim community who did that, because that enabled us to identify rapidly who this individual was and respond quickly.\"\n\nHe described the teen involved as a Caucasian male with mental health issues who was known to police.\n\nThe boy had been part of an anti-radicalisation support program since 2022 but police do not have concerns he is part of a wider network.\n\nOfficers have been in contact with the teenager's family.\n\n\"I think the family really do understand the situation that police were in, they are being very forthcoming with police,\" Mr Blanch said.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said there was \"indications he had been radicalised online.\"\n\n\"I want to reassure the community at this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone,\" Mr Cook said.\n\n\"Members of the WA Muslim community, who were concerned by his behaviour, contacted police prior to the incident and I thank them for their help,\" he said.\n\n\"Our police responded within minutes, they encountered a very confronting situation but their rapid and professional response kept our community safe.\"\n\nMr Blanch said the constable who fired the shot and his colleagues were \"hurting\" but stressed they had done their job.\n\nThe ASIO Director-General and Australian Federal Police Commissioner have briefed Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the incident.\n\n\"I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available,\" Mr Albanese said on social media.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia.\"\n\nAn investigation will examine the shooting and events leading up to the incident.\n\nThe Imam of the Mahmood Mosque in Adelaide, who previously served in Perth, condemned the attack \"in the strongest terms\".\n\n\"We are once again saddened to learn of another knife attack in which innocent civilians were harmed, this time in Perth,\" Imam Kamran Tahir said in a statement.\n\n\"It should be made very clear that there is no justification for such acts in Islam.\"", "source": {"uri": "aap.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "AustralianAssociatedPress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's an issue for our entire society, whether it be violent extremism, misogyny and violence against women. It is an issue that of course I'm concerned about,\" Albanese told reporters.\n\nWestern Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the boy had phoned police late Saturday saying he was about to commit \"acts of violence\" but did not say where. Minutes later, a member of the public reported to police seeing the boy with a knife in a hardware store parking lot.\n\nThree police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with stun guns. Police deployed both stun guns but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nThe stabbing victim is a man in his 30s who was wounded in his back. He was in serious but stable condition at a Perth hospital, police said.\n\nBlanch said members of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behavior before he was killed on Saturday.\n\nPolice said the stabbing had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack but have not declared it as such. Factors that can influence that decision include whether state police need federal resources, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organization domestic spy agency.\n\nBlanch said the Western Australia Police Force investigation did not need additional federal resources and he was confidence the situation was different from the one in Sydney.\n\n\"We are dealing with complex issues, both mental health issues but also online radicalization issues,\" Blanch said Sunday. \"But we believe he very much is acting alone and we do not have concerns at this time that there is an ongoing network or other concerns that might have been seen over in Sydney.\"\n\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb had declared the stabbings of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest in a Sydney church on April 15 as a terrorist act within hours. The boy arrested was later charged with committing a terrorist act. In the subsequent investigation, six more teenagers were charged with terror-related offenses.\n\nPolice alleged all seven were part of a network that \"adhered to a religiously motivated, violent extremist ideology.\"\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring last month's church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded. The 40-year-old attacker was shot dead by police.\n\nThe man had a history of schizophrenia and most of the victims he targeted were women. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.\n\nThe church attack is only the third to be classified by Australian authorities as a terrorist act since 2018.\n\nIn December 2022, three Christian fundamentalists shot dead two police officers and a bystander in an ambush near the community of Wieambilla in Queensland state. The shooters were later killed by police.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Papalia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Papalia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroshock_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electroshock weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Violent extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieambilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wieambilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Webb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assyrian people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Orthodox Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian fundamentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://english.aawsat.com/s3/files/styles/1200x600/public/2024-05/636376_0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540074", "eventUri": "eng-9540074", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 2867, "textEnd": 2875}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It's an issue for our entire society, whether it be violent extremism, misogyny and violence against women. It is an issue that of course I'm concerned about,\" Albanese told reporters.\n\nWestern Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the boy had phoned police late Saturday saying he was about to commit \"acts of violence\" but did not say where. Minutes later, a member of the public reported to police seeing the boy with a knife in a hardware store parking lot.\n\nThree police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with stun guns. Police deployed both stun guns but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nThe stabbing victim is a man in his 30s who was wounded in his back. He was in serious but stable condition at a Perth hospital, police said.\n\nBlanch said members of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behavior before he was killed on Saturday.\n\nPolice said the stabbing had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack but have not declared it as such. Factors that can influence that decision include whether state police need federal resources, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organization domestic spy agency.\n\nBlanch said the Western Australia Police Force investigation did not need additional federal resources and he was confidence the situation was different from the one in Sydney.\n\n\"We are dealing with complex issues, both mental health issues but also online radicalization issues,\" Blanch said Sunday. \"But we believe he very much is acting alone and we do not have concerns at this time that there is an ongoing network or other concerns that might have been seen over in Sydney.\"\n\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb had declared the stabbings of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest in a Sydney church on April 15 as a terrorist act within hours. The boy arrested was later charged with committing a terrorist act. In the subsequent investigation, six more teenagers were charged with terror-related offenses.\n\nPolice alleged all seven were part of a network that \"adhered to a religiously motivated, violent extremist ideology.\"\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring last month's church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded. The 40-year-old attacker was shot dead by police.\n\nThe man had a history of schizophrenia and most of the victims he targeted were women. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.\n\nThe church attack is only the third to be classified by Australian authorities as a terrorist act since 2018.\n\nIn December 2022, three Christian fundamentalists shot dead two police officers and a bystander in an ambush near the community of Wieambilla in Queensland state. The shooters were later killed by police.\n\nIn November 2018, a Somalia-born Muslim stabbed three pedestrians in downtown Melbourne, killing one, before police shot him dead.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

But the call was followed by another alerting police to someone \"running around a car park\" with a large kitchen knife.\n\nThree police officers responded within minutes and were immediately confronted by the teenager holding a large knife, Blanch said.\n\nThe commissioner said two officers drew their Tasers and a third officer drew their firearm. When asked to put down the knife, the 16-year-old did not respond and, according to body-camera footage, allegedly ran at the officers, Blanch said.\n\nThe first two officers fired their tasers but when the teenager allegedly continued to approach, the third officer fired a single shot which fatally wounded the 16-year-old, police said.\n\nBlanch said the teenager acted alone in what appeared to be a \"a very sad and tragic outcome\". He said what triggered the incident was currently unknown.\n\nThe 18-year-old who was stabbed was in a serious but stable condition in hospital and \"doing well\", authorities said on Sunday.\n\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he had spoken to Cook and received briefings from police and domestic spy agency Asio.\n\n\"My thoughts are with those who have been affected by the incident,\" he said. \"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia.\"\n\nCook, who has called a meeting with multi-faith community leaders, described the incident as a \"very tragic set of circumstances\" and thanked police for their swift action saying the community was \"indebted to them\".\n\n\"Our police responded within minutes. They encountered a very confronting situation but their rapid and professional response kept our community safe,\" the premier said.\n\n\"These cases are never straightforward. There's always a complex set of circumstances, cases and conditions which sit in the background.\"\n\nThe police commissioner described the alleged attacker as a \"Caucasian male\". He thanked members of the Muslim community who \"had the courage to respond and express their concerns that this person was exhibiting concerning behaviours\".\n\nBlanch said community members had alerted police after spotting something the 16-year-old posted online.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Cook_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Cook (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heroin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/4108aaed8288bfaf86a70e2c045d7079", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540074", "eventUri": "eng-9540074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It's an issue for our entire society, whether it be violent extremism, misogyny and violence against women. It is an issue that of course I'm concerned about,\" Albanese told reporters.\n\nWestern Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the boy had phoned police late Saturday saying he was about to commit \"acts of violence\" but did not say where. Minutes later, a member of the public reported to police seeing the boy with a knife in a hardware store parking lot.\n\nThree police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with stun guns. Police deployed both stun guns but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nThe stabbing victim is a man in his 30s who was wounded in his back. He was in serious but stable condition at a Perth hospital, police said.\n\nBlanch said members of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behavior before he was killed on Saturday.\n\nPolice said the stabbing had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack but have not declared it as such. Factors that can influence that decision include whether state police need federal resources, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organization domestic spy agency.\n\nBlanch said the Western Australia Police Force investigation did not need additional federal resources and he was confidence the situation was different from the one in Sydney.\n\n\"We are dealing with complex issues, both mental health issues but also online radicalization issues,\" Blanch said Sunday. \"But we believe he very much is acting alone and we do not have concerns at this time that there is an ongoing network or other concerns that might have been seen over in Sydney.\"\n\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb had declared the stabbings of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest in a Sydney church on April 15 as a terrorist act within hours. The boy arrested was later charged with committing a terrorist act. In the subsequent investigation, six more teenagers were charged with terror-related offenses.\n\nPolice alleged all seven were part of a network that \"adhered to a religiously motivated, violent extremist ideology.\"\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring last month's church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded. The 40-year-old attacker was shot dead by police.\n\nThe man had a history of schizophrenia and most of the victims he targeted were women. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.\n\nThe church attack is only the third to be classified by Australian authorities as a terrorist act since 2018.\n\nIn December 2022, three Christian fundamentalists shot dead two police officers and a bystander in an ambush near the community of Wieambilla in Queensland state. The shooters were later killed by police.\n\nIn November 2018, a Somalia-born Muslim stabbed three pedestrians in downtown Melbourne, killing one, before police shot him dead.", "source": {"uri":

It's an issue for our entire society, whether it be violent extremism, misogyny and violence against women. It is an issue that of course I'm concerned about,\" Albanese told reporters.\n\nWestern Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the boy had phoned police late Saturday saying he was about to commit \"acts of violence\" but did not say where. Minutes later, a member of the public reported to police seeing the boy with a knife in a hardware store parking lot.\n\nThree police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with stun guns. Police deployed both stun guns but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nThe stabbing victim is a man in his 30s who was wounded in his back. He was in serious but stable condition at a Perth hospital, police said.\n\nBlanch said members of the local Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behavior before he was killed on Saturday.\n\nThe boy had said in a text message to associates, \"I am going on the path of jihad tonight for the sake of Allah,\" Australian Associated Press reported, prompting several to alert police.\n\nPolice said the stabbing had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack but have not declared it as such. Factors that can influence that decision include whether state police need federal resources, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organization domestic spy agency.\n\nBlanch said the Western Australia Police Force investigation did not need additional federal resources and he was confidence the situation was different from the one in Sydney.\n\n\"We are dealing with complex issues, both mental health issues but also online radicalization issues,\" Blanch said Sunday. \"But we believe he very much is acting alone and we do not have concerns at this time that there is an ongoing network or other concerns that might have been seen over in Sydney.\"\n\nWestern Australia Premier Roger Cook said his government and the state education department had been aware of concerns at the boy's school about his behavior. Cook didn't directly respond to reports that several boys at Rossmoyne Senior High School, the prestigious government school he attended, were attempting to radicalize classmates.\n\n\"I'll leave that up the the Education Department to clarify,\" Cook told reporters. \"This young man was harboring some extremist thoughts, which is the reason why he was part of the Countering Violent Extremism program.\"\n\nAmanda Spencer-Teo, a parent of a Rossmoyne student, said multiple \"red flags\" had been raised about the behavior of some students.\n\n\"Parents have been raising this with the school for some time,\" Spencer-Teo, who will be an opposition party candidate at state elections next year, told The Australian newspaper. \"The school and the department have failed to provide information to those concerned parents.\"\n\nIn the stabbings at a Sydney church on April 15, New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb declared the stabbings of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest as a terrorist act within hours. The boy arrested was later charged with committing a terrorist act. In the subsequent investigation, six more teenagers were charged with terror-related offenses.\n\nPolice alleged all seven were part of a network that \"adhered to a religiously motivated, violent extremist ideology.\"\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring the church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded.\n\nThe 40-year-old attacker, who was shot dead by police, had a history of schizophrenia and most of the victims he targeted were women. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rod_mcguirk@aol.com", "name": "Rod McGUIRK", "type": "author",

It's an issue for our entire society, whether it be violent extremism, misogyny and violence against women. It is an issue that of course I'm concerned about.\"\n\nWestern Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the boy had phoned police late Saturday saying he was about to commit \"acts of violence\" but did not say where. Minutes later, a member of the public reported to police seeing the boy with a knife in a hardware store carpark.\n\nThree police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with stun guns. Police used both stun guns but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nThe stabbing victim is a man in his 30s who was wounded in his back. He was in serious but stable condition at a Perth hospital, police said.\n\nBlanch said members of the Muslim community had raised concerns with police about the boy's behaviour before his death.\n\nThe boy had said in a text message to associates, \"I am going on the path of jihad tonight for the sake of Allah,\" Australian Associated Press reported, prompting several to alert police.\n\nPolice said the stabbing had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack but have not declared it as such. Factors that can influence that decision include whether state police need federal resources, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation domestic spy agency.\n\nBlanch said the Western Australia Police investigation did not need additional federal resources and he was confident the situation was different from the one in Sydney.\n\n\"We are dealing with complex issues, both mental health issues but also online radicalisation issues,\" Blanch said on Sunday. \"But we believe he very much is acting alone and we do not have concerns at this time that there is an ongoing network or other concerns that might have been seen over in Sydney.\"\n\nWestern Australia Premier Roger Cook said his Government and the state education department had been aware of concerns at the boy's school about his behaviour. Cook didn't directly respond to reports that several boys at Rossmoyne Senior High School, the prestigious school he attended, were attempting to radicalise classmates.\n\n\"I'll leave that up the Education Department to clarify,\" Cook told reporters. \"This young man was harbouring some extremist thoughts, which is the reason why he was part of the Countering Violent Extremism program.\"\n\nAmanda Spencer-Teo, a parent of a Rossmoyne student, said multiple \"red flags\" had been raised about the behaviour of some students.\n\n\"Parents have been raising this with the school for some time,\" Spencer-Teo, who will be an opposition party candidate at state elections next year, told The Australian newspaper. \"The school and the department have failed to provide information to those concerned parents.\"\n\nIn the stabbings at a Sydney church on April 15, New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb declared the stabbings of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest as a terrorist act within hours. The boy arrested was later charged with committing a terrorist act. In the subsequent investigation, six more teenagers were charged with terror-related offences.\n\nPolice alleged all seven were part of a network that \"adhered to a religiously motivated, violent extremist ideology\".\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticised Australian police for declaring the church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded.\n\nThe 40-year-old attacker, who was shot dead by police, had a history of schizophrenia and most of the victims he targeted were women.

He was taken to a hospital in serious but stable condition, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.\n\nPolice and Australian Security Intelligence Organization agents have been conducting a counterterrorism investigation in the east coast city of Sydney since another 16-year-old boy stabbed an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and priest in a church on April 15.\n\nThat boy has been charged with committing a terrorist act. Six of his alleged associates have also been charged with a range of offenses, including conspiring to engage in or planning a terrorist act. All remain in custody.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the latest stabbing in Perth by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw and ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess, who heads the nation's main domestic spy agency.\n\n\"I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available,\" Albanese said.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" he added.\n\nPolice received an emergency phone call after 10 p.m. from a teenager saying he was going to commit acts of violence, Western Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch said.\n\nThe boy had been participating in a program for young people at risk of radicalization, Blanch added.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I don't want to say he has been radicalized or is radicalized because I think that forms part of the investigation,\" he said.\n\nPolice said they were later alerted by a phone call from a member of the public that a knife attack was underway in the parking lot. Three police officers responded, one armed with a gun and two with conducted energy devices.\n\nPolice deployed both conducted energy devices but they failed to incapacitate the boy before he was killed by a single gunshot, Blanch said.\n\nSome Muslim leaders have criticized Australian police for declaring last month's church stabbing a terrorist act but not a rampage two days earlier in a Sydney shopping mall in which six people were killed and a dozen wounded. The 40-year-old attacker in the mall attack was shot dead by police. Police have yet to reveal the man's motive.\n\nThe church attack is only the third to be classified by Australian authorities as a terrorist act since 2018.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn December 2022, three Christian fundamentalists shot dead two police officers and a bystander in an ambush near the community of Wieambilla in Queensland state. The shooters were later killed by police.\n\nIn November 2018, a Somalia-born Muslim stabbed three pedestrians in downtown Melbourne, killing one, before police shot him dead.", "source": {"uri":

Members of the public had also alerted the police that the teenager was wielding a knife, and officers were dispatched to the scene.\n\nThe episode comes just weeks after two stabbing attacks alarmed Australia. A mass stabbing in a shopping mall in Sydney killed six people and injured at least a dozen on April 13. Days later, a 15-year-old boy was arrested in the stabbing of an Assyrian Orthodox bishop and several other people during a mass that the police said was an act of terrorism.\n\nOn Saturday in Perth, the two officers who arrived to confront the teenager drew their tasers and a firearm, Commissioner Blanch said. They tried to convince him to drop his knife, but he did not comply and rushed at one of the officers.\n\nAfter the officers fired their tasers, the suspect continued to advance toward the officer carrying the firearm, who then fatally shot him. The teen died an hour later at the hospital.\n\nBefore his confrontation with the police, the suspect had stabbed a middle-age male in the parking lot.

I don't need additional capability at this time whilst it meets the criteria, or at least the definition,' Commissioner Blanch said.\n\n'It would be too early for me to act now, because I don't have the concerns of a broader network that might be involved at this stage.'\n\nWA Police were called to the carpark outside Bunnings Willetton on just after 10pm, where they found a teen armed with a 30cm kitchen knife\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said there were indications the boy had been radicalised online.\n\nThe 16-year-old boy had previously been involved in a countering violent extremism program since 2022, with support from psychologists and faith leaders.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said intelligence and security officers did not believe there was an ongoing threat.\n\n'I have received a briefing on the situation by the ASIO Director-General and the AFP Commissioner, and I'm advised there is no ongoing threat to the community on the information available,' he said.\n\n'We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia.'\n\nA man aged in his 30s, who was found close by with a stab wound and a punctured lung, had reportedly been leaving a 24-hour gym in the complex at the time of the attack.\n\nHe was treated at the scene by St John Ambulance WA and transported to Royal Perth Hospital where he remains in a

But he didn't provide his name or a location.\n\nSome minutes later, police received another call from a person stating that a male with a knife was running around a car park. Police immediately responded to that call, and three officers attended that location. When they exited their vehicle, the officers were confronted by a male alone, with a large kitchen knife.\n\nBlanch said that the officers challenged the male to put down the knife, but he did not comply and rushed one of the officers. Two officers deployed their tasers but both of them didn't have the full desired effect. The male continued to advance on the third officer with a firearm, who fired a single shot and fatally wounded the male.\n\nThe deceased male was a 16-year-old Caucasian man. He was taken to hospital and declared deceased at approximately 11:00 p.m., the police commissioner added.\n\n\"There was a report and we didn't know that until after the shooting, that a male had been stabbed in the back in the car park where police did respond,\" Blanch said. \"That male is currently in hospital with a stab wound to the back.

Police also received reports of a person \"running around a car park\" carrying a large knife.\n\nThree police officers confronted the teenager in the car park. Two officers drew their Tasers and a third drew a firearm. When asked to put down the knife, the 16-year-old did not respond and, according to body-camera footage, ran at the officers.\n\nThe first two officers fired their Tasers but when the teenager allegedly continued to approach, the third officer fired a single shot, fatally wounding the 16-year-old, police said.\n\nIt was only after the teenager was shot that police discovered the man he had stabbed in the back. The man, aged in his 30s, was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition.\n\nWA police commissioner, Col Blanch, said the teenager acted alone in what appeared to be a \"a very sad and tragic outcome\". He said any triggerfor the incident was unknown.\n\nThe teenager was not known to be involved at any local mosques. He had suffered mental health issues, was known to police and had been involved in a countering violent extremism (CVE) program since 2022 when he was 13, the commissioner said.\n\nBlanch said the teenager was one of \"three or four\" under-18s in the deradicalisation program.\n\n\"All police around the country have what is called the countering violent extremism program for those ... exhibiting behaviours that might be religious or issues-motivated concerns,\" he said.\n\n\"We do have young people in those programs that have exhibited those behaviours. This 16-year-old caucasian male was part of that program.\"\n\nThe WA premier, Roger Cook, said on Monday that the attack had \"all the hallmarks of a terrorist incident\".\n\n\"This young man was harbouring some extremist thoughts, which is the reason why he was part of the countering violent extremism program,\" he said.\n\nThe state's police minister, Paul Papalia, said no deradicalisation program could guarantee success.\n\n\"It is a really tough task and none of the programs that have been attempted anywhere have been universally successful,\" he said. \"They are confronting a serious challenge in changing someone who's been radicalised and attempting to get them back on to a more reasonable pathway.\n\n\"What it demonstrates is just how tough a task it is. Individuals acting alone in isolation from other people can easily be influenced online and we would not necessarily know about it, and they can act with little warning.\"\n\nThe teenager attended nearby Rossmoyne Senior high school. Parents at the school had previously raised concerns about an allaged cohort of radicalised boys at the school, with at least one parent having flagged concerns to the WA education department and to the Australian Federal Police that the group had tried to \"indoctrinate\" their son.\n\nAt the school on Monday a parent, Niranji Wickranasinghe, said it was understood the teenager converted to Islam a few years ago.\n\n\"He was a very kind-hearted, helpful child. My son, who is in year 9, has said he was very friendly and he has helped him before as a friend and he's a good child,\" she said.\n\n\"I think they said he was watching some videos online. . . he's not a bad kind of child. ... but because of these online issues, I think he has gone mad.\"\n\nThe imam of Perth's largest mosque, Nasir Mosque, said the city's Islamic community feared a wave of Islamophobic backlash in the aftermath of the attack.\n\n\"We're extremely concerned about Islamophobia,\" the iman, Syed Wadood Janud, said.\n\n\"Sometimes the backlash can be very harsh, and that's why we want to reach out to the wider community.\n\n\"We condemn any act of violence which is committed in our name, in the name of our religion. Our religion literally means peace.\"\n\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he had received a briefing from the Asio director general, Mike Burgess, and AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, and said there was \"no ongoing threat\" to the community.\n\n\"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

[It is] a really serious challenge in changing someone who's been radicalised and attempting them to get back into a more reasonable pathway.\n\n\"It is a good program in that regard, because in the absence of it, there's no response to that sort of thing, but also to be part of it, you're not necessarily a criminal. You haven't engaged necessarily in any criminal activity.\n\n\"This individual may not have done anything that would have enabled police to do anything other than get him into this program.\"\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said that, while the alleged offender was radicalised online by extremist ideology, he acted alone and it was not being declared a terrorist event. He has called a meeting with leaders of various faiths, which he will attend later today.\n\n\"It certainly has the hallmarks of one, and the reason why I would declare it as a terrorist act going forward, it's about timing,\" he said.\n\n\"If I need extra capability, particularly from the Commonwealth, sometimes you'll see terrorist acts being claimed very early or declared very early.\n\n\"I believe this is a person acting alone ... I don't need additional capability at this time whilst it meets the criteria, or at least the definition.\n\n\"That's something that we can work towards as we find out more information from the motivations behind this.\"\n\nThe victim is currently in hospital with a stab wound to the back, in a serious but stable condition.

Seven were arrested in police raids on their homes in the days after the attack.\n\nAustralia's domestic intelligence agency warned of the online radicalisation of teenagers in its annual threat assessment in February.\n\nMike Burgess, director-general of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, said the numbers had \"increased dramatically\" and teenagers were now the focus of more than half of its highest priority investigations each week.\n\nThe increase involved children as young as 13, a trend Burgess described as \"deeply concerning\".\n\nAnthony Albanese, the prime minister, said he had been briefed on the latest attack. He said: \"We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia.\"", "source": {"uri": "thetimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sunday Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bernard_lagan@thetimes.co.uk", "name": "Bernard Lagan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assyrian people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orthodox Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Burgess_(intelligence_chief)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Burgess (intelligence chief)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Threat assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_raid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police raid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Security Intelligence Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent extremism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F60ed1335-a196-488c-a8c1-f7b5037f990b.jpg?crop=862%2C485%2C0%2C0&resize=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540074", "eventUri": "eng-9540074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Both mental health issues but also online radicalisation issues. He is known to police, but we believe he very much is acting alone.\"\n\nIn fact, the boy was known to more authorities than just local police.\n\nCommissioner Blanch said the boy was one of \"three or four\" young people in WA actively participating in a national support program aimed at countering violent extremism online.\n\nDespite that, it was unfortunately not enough to stop what transpired in the car park on Saturday might.\n\nFor the few in that area at the time, it was a confronting scene to witness.\n\nJust a few restaurants and a 24-hour gym were open at the time.\n\nJohn Chi was on shift last night at the Korean BBQ restaurant Hancookwan when the incident unfolded.\n\n\"There was a guy wielding a knife, or an object from what I was understanding at the time, just in the Bunnings car park area,\" he said.\n\n\"The guy chased the police car up all the way into the no entry sign towards the Bunnings car park area and then ... the police moved away and called for backup.\"\n\nMr Chi said a police car then pulled up on a grassy patch by a nearby bus stop.\n\n\"What happened from there was a stand-off with police,\" he said.\n\n\"Two tasers were shot at the person and then the gunshot was fired promptly afterwards, however, there was a bit of distance before all of those were happening -- everyone in my restaurant was able to hear the gunshot as well.\"\n\nThe restaurant supervisor said it was not until this morning that he found out the teenager's declared intention of committing acts of violence.\n\n\"When he was chasing the police car around, he was holding it [the knife] like around his waist area and then when he was running towards the police car, obviously he was holding it up in the air so that's why the police pulled away,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm just a little bit shocked the person has died, he's 16 years-old, which is quite unfortunate.\"\n\nMr Chi said the police presence in the area was huge by the time he finished his shift.\n\n\"To start off with about I think one police car or patrol car and then it went to maybe two very soon afterwards and then in the span of 10 minutes we had about over another five to six police cars,\" he said.\n\n\"That would escalate over 10 to 20 through the course of 10:10pm to about 11pm.\n\n\"By the time I got out of work there was a police car at every intersection up all the way to IGA.\"\n\nA major investigation is now underway into what led the boy to attack a random person in that car park last night.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

I don't need additional capability at this time whilst it meets the criteria or at least the definition,\" Mr Blanch said.\n\n\"It would be too early for me to act now because I don't have the concerns of a broader network that might be involved at this stage.\"\n\nOriginally published as Anthony Albanese slams social media giants for pushing young people towards extreme content after teen killed by police\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Perth_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Perth Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mujahideen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The West Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Violent extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossmoyne_Senior_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rossmoyne Senior High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Federal Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-14562907/8f803ceb8fa144d0f078497dc6b1576fc7575bed-16x9-x0y395w1024h576.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540074", "eventUri": "eng-9540074", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

He said there were indications the 16-year-old \"had been radicalised online.\"\n\n\"It is a tough gig to try and change people's beliefs once they've become obsessed and radicalised in this way,\" he said. \"These are people who haven't necessarily committed a crime and you can't lock people up for holding a belief ...

It was not limited to those convicted of crimes.\n\nMs. Aly said in a statement that de-radicalisation programs \"are an important community safety measure. They are often successful but no program can guarantee success. It's the sensitive nature of these programs that we often only hear about them when they don't succeed.\n\n\"I commend and thank the WA Police for the positive way they have worked with the Muslim community on this matter.\"\n\nDetectives working on the case said the 16-year-old was believed to be acting alone.\n\nMr. Blanch said the incident \"certainly has all the hallmarks\" of a terrorism-related incident, but he was not prepared to declare it as such \"at this stage.\"\n\n\"It would be too early for me to act now because I don't have the concerns of a broader network that might be involved,\" he explained.\n\n\"We would also like to mention that Islam has nothing to do with any acts of violence that are committed in its name. Islam is a religion that literally means peace,\" he said at a press conference.\n\n\"This was so close to home -- any one of us could have been at Bunnings,\" he said.\n\nMr. Janud said Muslims were concerned about potential Islamophobia following the incident, as well as the rise of radicalisation across the country.\n\n\"Radicalisation of all forms, whether that is anti-Semitic, whether that is Islamophobic, whether that is right-wing Neo Nazis, we see this on the rise,\" he said. \"As Australians, we all need to come together and tackle these issues that may be prevalent in the

You haven't engaged necessarily in any criminal activity. So that's something to understand.'\n\nThe final message sent by the teen has also been revealed, with the boy reportedly saying he was going 'on the path of jihad'.\n\nThe 16-year-old sent the message to several people on social media, with several members of Perth's concerned Islamic community alerting police of the boy's messages.\n\n'Brothers please forgive me for any time I have wronged you, I am going on the path of jihad tonight for the sake of Allah,' the boy, who had reportedly converted to Islam, wrote.\n\n'I am a soldier of the mujahideen of Al-Qaeda and take responsibility for the actions that will ... take place tonight.'\n\nHe also warned his contacts to 'clear' incriminating evidence from devices like laptops and phones.\n\nParents at an esteemed Perth high school claimed the boy was part of a radical group who attempted to 'indoctrinate' other students (pictured, officers at the scene)\n\n'If you have any illegal or jihadi things online or in real life please make sure to hide them well and clear your technology such as laptops and phones including search history ... as the police will likely look into my contacts,' he wrote.\n\nRossmoyne Principal Alan Brown sent an email to parents on Sunday afternoon offering support and advice.\n\n'Young people may want to meet in groups or turn to social media for support and to express their feelings. Whilst this may be helpful, please be aware of potential misinformation or inappropriate comments,' he said.\n\n'If you become aware of any such gatherings, it is important to make sure there are responsible adults present, and you may wish to accompany your child.'\n\nWA Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the deceased teenager who known to police for 'mental health issues and radicalisation issues' since he was 14.\n\nHe confirmed the teenager's family is working with police.\n\n'I think this is a very challenged individual who was there on the night and I think the family really do understand the situation that police were in,' he said.\n\n'They are being very forthcoming with police.'\n\nREAD MORE: CCTV of 'radicalised' teen lunging at cops before he was shot dead", "source":

I am going in the path of jihad tonight for the sake of Allah,\" he reportedly said.\n\n\"I am a soldier of the mujahideen of Al-Qaeda and take responsibility for the actions that will ... take place. Please don't forget me and the mujahideen in your duat (afterlife).\"\n\nMr Cook said the teenager was in the Countering violent extremism (CVE) program and the state government was \"obviously well aware\" of the thoughts he was harbouring.\n\n\"This young man was harbouring some extremist thoughts which is the reason why he was part of the countering violent extremism program,\" Mr Cook said.\n\n\"As the Police Commissioner said yesterday, this incident has all the hallmarks of a terrorist incident.\"\n\nMr Cook said the classifying of a terrorist act brought other measures, powers and agencies into the investigation, but said it would be done if there was an \"ongoing risk\" to the community and if there were other people involved.\n\nThe Premier moved to assuage fears of further incidents, reiterating the Police commissioner's earlier remarks that there was \"no further threat to the community and the situation is in hand\".\n\nCommissioner Blanch said the boy had been known to police since 2022 when he was enrolled in a deradicalisation program targeted at countering violent extremist ideologies.\n\nThe incident has not, however, been declared an act of terrorism with police arguing it is too soon to reach that conclusion before the motivations behind the attack are investigated.\n\n\"It certainly has the hallmarks of one (a terrorist attack) and the reason why I would declare it as a terrorist act going forward, it's about timing... sometimes you'll see terrorist acts being claimed very early or declared very early,\" Mr Blanch said.", "source":

Willetton's very quiet -- there's no pubs here.\n\n\"So there's obviously something happened in the gym, then to have an argument then spilling out here.\"\n\nBy sunrise, the huge police presence had reduced to a forensics van and three officers peering into bins with their torches, the man said.\n\nThe incident delayed staff at the round-the-clock Sai Vet Hospital from going home at the end of their shift on Saturday night.\n\nHigh Road residents Ameya and Gouri Khandekar, who have lived near the Bunnings for the past three years, heard sirens but thought nothing of it in the otherwise quiet suburb.\n\n\"It's scary,' Ms Khandekar told reporters.\n\n\"I have two boys and my older one's 12 who's just started to go to high school and you have to be careful with what they watch ... watching things online.\n\n\"Because of the school zones, it's a very family-oriented suburb.

Pyrum's thermolysis process is largely energy self-sufficient and, according to the Fraunhofer Institute, saves significantly more CO emissions than today's standard recycling processes for end-of-life tyres - especially compared to incineration in cement plants - and produces new raw materials such as thermolysis oil, gas and recovered carbon black from the waste used as input materials. In this way, Pyrum closes the recyclable material loop and pursues a completely sustainable business model. As a pioneer, Pyrum Innovations AG was the first company in the end-of-life tyre recycling sector to receive REACH registration from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the thermolysis oil it produces. This means that the oil is recognised as an official raw material that can be used in production processes. In addition, Pyrum has received ISCC PLUS certification for the thermolysis oil and the recovered carbon black. Both products are thus considered sustainable and renewable raw materials. In addition, Pyrum has received ISO 14001 certification for its environmental management system and ISO 9001 certification for its quality management system. These achievements have also been recognised by international experts in the tyre industry. For example, Pyrum won the Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category at the inaugural Recircle Awards and has been a finalist in the Grand Prix of German SMEs (Gro\u00dfer Preis des Mittelstandes) three times in a row.", "source": {"uri": "finanzen.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "finanzen.ch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_decomposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal decomposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillingen,_Saarland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dillingen, Saarland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dillingen, Saarland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forklift", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forklift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_AG", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continental AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moselle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moselle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moselle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesse", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hesse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hesse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korbach", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korbach"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Korbach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Chemicals_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Chemicals Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration,_Evaluation,_Authorisation_and_Restriction_of_Chemicals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ISO 9000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraunhofer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_14000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ISO 14000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779593", "eventUri": "eng-9779593", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

As part of this agreement, Continental will provide Pyrum with a steady stream of end-of-life tires for recycling and has made a significant upfront investment in future rCB deliveries. This collaboration signifies a substantial step forward in the circular economy for the tire industry.\n\nThe new Pyrum plant, slated for construction in Perl-Besch on the Moselle by the end of 2025, is set to significantly boost Pyrum's recycling capacity. This expansion will double the facility's capacity from processing 20,000 tonnes to 40,000 tonnes of end-of-life tyres annually. The final application documents for an early start to construction are being prepared and are expected to be submitted by early August 2024. Following approval, a ground-breaking ceremony will mark the commencement of construction, which is planned to begin in early October 2024. This expansion is a strategic move to enhance Pyrum's recycling capabilities and support its sustainability goals.\n\nJorge Almeida, Head of Sustainability at Continental Tires, highlighted the growing importance of recycled materials in tire manufacturing. He emphasized the need to shift from an \"end-of-life\" to an \"end-of-use\" approach for tires. This concept envisions the end of a tire's functional life as the start of a new opportunity, where components and materials are recycled back into the production cycle. Almeida noted that Continental Tires, in collaboration with Pyrum, is working on developing highly efficient processes to maximize the recovery and reuse of tire materials, thus enhancing the circularity of their products and supporting sustainable practices.\n\nJorge emphasized that for the company, the end of a tire's service life is merely a transition point, not an endpoint. His goal is to ensure that products, components, and materials continue to be utilized effectively beyond their initial use phase. To enhance recyclability, Almeida advocates for a shift in perspective where the end of a tire's service life becomes a new opportunity for reuse. In partnership with Pyrum, Continental is developing advanced processes to efficiently reintegrate as many components and materials as possible from used tires back into their production cycle.\n\nPyrum Innovations AG operates within the lucrative recycling sector, focusing on used tyres and various plastics through its patented thermolysis technology. This innovative process is notably energy self-sufficient and, according to the Fraunhofer Institute, achieves a significant reduction in CO2 emissions compared to traditional recycling methods and incineration in cement plants. Pyrum's technology transforms waste materials into valuable raw materials such as thermolysis oil, gas, and recycled carbon black (rCB), effectively closing the material cycle and adhering to a 100% sustainable business model.", "source": {"uri": "chemanalyst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "chemanalyst.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circular economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_AG", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Continental AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Service life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_decomposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermal decomposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraunhofer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incineration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incineration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Trenchless_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Trenchless Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Cleaning", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Cleaning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Geotechnical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Geotechnical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779593", "eventUri": "eng-9779593", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

This globally recognized certification confirms the transparency of the traceability of the raw materials used in the production process. Certification of the raw materials enables Continental to ensure the end-to-end traceability of the materials from sustainable sources. For the premium manufacturer, this represents another step on the journey towards 100-percent sustainable materials in its tire products by 2050 at the latest. P\u00fachov is the company's third ISCC PLUS-certified production site, following the tire plants in Lousado, Portugal, and Hefei, China.\n\n\"Our plant in P\u00fachov is the first Continental truck tire plant to receive the ISCC PLUS certification. It is a sign of our commitment to both quality and sustainability,\" says Anton Vatala, Head of the Continental truck tire plant in P\u00fachov, Slovakia.\n\nThe ISCC PLUS certification is based on fulfilling and documenting certain raw material mass balancing procedures. In the mass-balance approach, fossil, renewable and recycled raw materials are mixed in existing systems and processes. The quantities used are tracked along the entire value chain and can therefore be allocated proportionately at any time. The mass-balance approach enables Continental to gradually increase the proportion of sustainable materials in its products. It ensures that the balance of certified sustainable materials can be accurately reported.\n\n\"Certifying our production processes underpins our extensive efforts in the area of sustainability. With ISCC PLUS, we are able to tackle the transition to a circular economy and a sustainable bio-economy,\" says Jorge Almeida, Head of Sustainability at Continental Tires. He adds: \"Our aim is to gradually roll out the mass balance approach to all our tire plants worldwide. P\u00fachov is our first truck tire plant to be certified for this purpose.\"\n\nISCC PLUS is an internationally recognized voluntary certification system. It is applicable to the bio-economy and circular economy and certifies non-conventional raw materials that can be used, for example, in the areas of foodstuffs, animal feed, chemicals, plastics, packaging and textiles.

Harnessed with Continental Tire's cutting-edge technologies, ExtremeContact XC7 is designed to improve travel safety and comfort. Continental Tires' latest offering, enabled by its partners in the automotive aftermarket, testifies to its consistency of its \"in the market for the market\" commitment in China. HANNOVER, Germany, July 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- One of the world's leading tire manufacturers, Continental Tires has continuously harnessed its cutting-edge technological strength, launching the brand-new premium flagship tire line ExtremeContact XC7. As the first product line fully equipped with ContiSeal and ContiSilent in all sizes, it satisfies diversified mobility needs for the consumers.\n\nContinental Tires ExtremeContact XC7\n\n\"Continental Tires has accumulated profound insights into the unique demands of consumers. With the debut of ExtremeContact XC7, it can improve the drivers a safer and more comfortable driving experience to the next level. One of the core technologies applied to this new product - ContiSeal Self-Sealing Technology, continuously guards the safety of users and is widely recognized in the world.\" said Tolga Mutlu, Head of Product Management, Continental Tires APAC.\n\nContiSeal Self-Sealing Technology Brings Proactive Safety to a New Level\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nAs one of Continental Tire's key technologies, ContiSeal Self-Sealing Technology has brought the concept of \"proactive safety\" to a new level. The sticky viscous sealant layer on the inside of the tire is able to close up damage up to 5 mm in diameter, ensuring that 80% of punctures are immediately fixed so drivers can continue to drive to the nearest workshop. Moreover, the self-sealing capability remains stable and effective across temperatures ranging from -35\u2103 to 70\u2103 throughout the whole usage life of the tire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinental Tires ContiSeal Self-Sealing Technology Providing Safety Protection\n\nContinuous Product Evolution Remains in Line with Chinese Consumers' Mobility Demands\n\nFirmly rooted in the Chinese market, along with the booming trend of the new energy vehicle industry, Continental Tires collaborates with channel partner Tuhu, China's largest online auto retail platform with over 100 million subscribed users. This gives Tuhu an advantage in understanding Chinese consumers' demands for travel safety and tranquility. With cutting-edge R&D capability, Continental Tires combines the needs of the users with continuous product and technology upgrades, to launch ExtremeContact XC7 exclusively on the Tuhu platform.\n\nOutstanding Wet Performance Ensures Greater Safety\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany regions in China have frequent rainfall, making driving on wet roads a common driving condition. Designed for improved safety under all conditions, ExtremeContact XC7 features excellent anti-slip designs in wet conditions thanks to its extraordinary wet braking performance. The Aqua Channel Advanced surface sipes can significantly accelerate water drainage, resulting in outstanding grip even on wet slippery roads. At the same time, ExtremeContact XC7's sophisticated Zig-Zag serrated grooves design and Blade Edge Pattern can break through the water film to reduce slippage thus enhancing wet grip performance.\n\nEffective Noise Reduction Guarantees a Tranquil Ride\n\nThe ExtremeContact XC7 is fully equipped with CSS 2-in-1 Noise Reduction Technology specially developed to meet consumers' higher demand for a silent mobility experience. Continental Tire's renowned ContiSilent technology can effectively absorb tire cavity noise using built-in polyurethane silent foam, while ContiSeal's sealant layer enhances the weight of the inner side of the tire, resulting in reduced vibrations caused by deformation and consequently lower noise. The ingenious 2-in-1 design can dramatically suppress noise across different frequency ranges, helping achieve a broader frequency noise reduction.\n\nWith sizes ranging from 17\" to 20\" and available in 34 articles, ExtremeContact XC7 fits various luxury cars and SUVs, providing premium and innovative tire solutions to the consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Continental AG\n\nContinental develops pioneering technologies and services for sustainable and connected mobility of people and their goods.

It looks quite like the Nothing Phone (2a) with the Glyph Interface on top of the back panel. This isn't surprising as the new device is a 'Plus' version of the Nothing Phone (2a). It would be an upgrade though with better cameras and a faster chipset.\n\nNothing Phone (2a) was unveiled by the brand on X with an image showcasing the back design. It has the same Glyph Interface design as the Phone (2a), which covers only the top half of the device. The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus can be seen in a Silver colour but it's expected to launch in more shades.\n\nPrior to the design reveal, Nothing has been revealing some details about the Phone (2a) Plus. Yesterday, it confirmed the camera specs. The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus will feature 50MP + 50MP dual cameras at the back and also a 50MP front camera. The upgrade here is the selfie camera, which is a 32MP sensor on the Phone (2a).\n\nIt's also confirmed to feature the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro SoC with Mali-G610 MC4 GPU. Nothing Phone (2a) will be the first phone to launch with this chipset. It's claimed to offer a 10 percent performance boost over the Phone (2a).\n\nAs for the rest of its specifications, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is expected to feature a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 1300 nits of peak brightness, and a high brightness mode of 1100 nits. It will have Gorilla Glass 5 protection layered on top. The smartphone is also tipped to pack a 5,000mAh battery with 50W fast charging.

The company had only recently introduced the Phone 2a model for buyers but now we are seeing the 2a Plus moniker added to its lineup. Unlike our estimates, the Phone 2a Plus doesn't get a bigger display but there are some notable hardware upgrades that look to justify the higher price tag than the Phone 2a.\n\nNothing is once again using a MediaTek Dimensity chipset and the battery size is the same but the design sees minor alterations to help it differentiate from the Phone 2a.\n\nNothing Phone 2a launch price in India is Rs 27,999 for the base 8GB + 256GB variant, going up to Rs 29,999 if you want the 12GB + 256GB model. There will be launch day offers which give you the chance to get further discounts on the phone. The Phone 2a Plus will go on sale from August 7.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus sports the same 6.7-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz adaptive refresh rate like the Phone 2a. It is upgraded to the new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset with up to 12GB and 256GB storage. The brand says the new chipset makes the Phone 2a Plus 10 percent faster than the Phone 2a.\n\nIt runs on the reliable and bloatware-free Nothing OS version based on Android 14 and the Phone 2a Plus will get 3 more OS upgrades along with 4 years of security patches.\n\nOn the imaging front, Phone 2a Plus comes with the same 50MP dual rear camera system with OIS on the main sensor.\n\nHowever, the front shooter has now been upgraded from 32MP to a 50MP sensor. Similarly, the Phone 2a Plus packs a 5,000mAh battery but it supports 50W charging speed now, a marginal bump from the 45W speed available with the Phone 2a.

Nothing's latest phone, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus, follows the trend set by devices like the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 by being sort-of new.\n\nIt's a good thing we thought the Nothing Phone 2a was really good and that the design is still a winner, because the Phone 2a Plus may make a few people a bit annoyed.\n\nRecommended Videos Nothing Phone 2a Plus specs\n\nIt's going to be a tough game of spot-the-difference when examining the spec sheet, but here we go. Starting from the front, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus has a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with a 2412 by 1084 pixel resolution, a 120Hz adaptive screen refresh rate, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protecting it. There's a fingerprint sensor under the display and a 50-megapixel selfie camera at the top, which can also shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second.\n\nFlip the phone over, and you'll immediately see the same Glyph Interface lighting system introduced with the Nothing Phone 2a. This system slims down the array compared to the Nothing Phone 2 but still provides neat features like the Glyph Timer. There are two more 50MP cameras on the back of the phone, and the main camera has both optical and electronic image stabilization (OIS and EIS).\n\nMediaTek has provided a special Dimensity 7350 Pro processor for the Phone 2a Plus, a chip not used in any other phone at the moment, and it comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space. Plus, there will be an 8GB/256GB version of the phone released only in India. A 5,000mAh battery provides the power, and it can be recharged at up to 50W, although there is no charger included in the box. The software is Android 14 with Nothing OS 2.6 onboard, and the company commits to supporting it with three years of major updates and four years of security updates.\n\nThe best-looking Nothing phone yet?\n\nWondering where the spec differences are between the Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus? There aren't many, with the new, faster 4nm MediaTek chip and GPU, the 50MP selfie camera, a few tweaks on the software front for the rear camera's portrait mode, and slightly faster charging being the main ones. Nothing says the Phone 2a Plus is for power users, and the chip gives a 10% performance upgrade for app loading over the 2a, while the GPU is apparently 30% faster when playing games.\n\nLeaving aside these changes, Nothing also loves to mix up the design of its phones, even when they're only variations of inherently the same model, and I think this one is the best interpretation yet. I've been trying the gray version of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus (it's also available in black), and it's utterly brilliant looking. Nothing has used a metallic finish for the design under the transparent rear panel, showing off the NFC coil behind the cameras and in the \"racetrack\" design that flows down the back of the phone. It's a lot more eye-catching than the black Phone 2a I reviewed, and it's definitely the color to get if you want to make a statement.\n\nAluminum has been used for the mid-frame, and the edge of the phone has a smoother feel compared to the textured Phone 2a. I love the curve of the plastic rear panel's sides and the way it avoids any sharpness when holding the phone. It's the same physical size and weight as the Phone 2a and has the same IP54 dust and water resistance rating, too. The Glyph lights and Nothing's fun ring and notification sounds are still a highlight. No, it's not really much different, but it's still a superb-looking and feeling phone.\n\nWhat about the camera?\n\nThe main and wide-angle cameras appear to be the same as the ones fitted to the Nothing Phone 2a, but the selfie camera has been upgraded to a 50MP camera, so let's talk about this one first. Taking a pair of selfies outside, shaded from strong sunlight, the Phone 2a Plus' photo definitely has more detail and more accurate skin tone, with greater control over the contrast, too. However, it is quite heavy-handed with the colors, and I'm not convinced the portrait effect is any more accurate than before.\n\nI can't fully assess the camera after just a pair of selfies, but there's obviously a difference, and it may come down to personal preference which phone takes the \"better\" selfie. You can see the comparison between the Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus' selfies in the gallery below. I've also taken a few photos on an exceptionally sunny day to try out the Phone 2a Plus' main and wide-angle cameras, too.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 9\n\nThe Phone 2a took fun, colorful photos that were ideal for sharing online, and the Phone 2a Plus doesn't seem to deviate far from this formula. Reds, blues, and greens pop off the screen as the camera amplifies the HDR effect, and the wide-angle camera usually matches the main camera for vibrancy, too. In the few photos I've taken, it seems to be a repeat of the Phone 2a, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nHow to get a Nothing Phone 2a Plus\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus is available in the U.S. through the \"US Beta Program,\" just like the Nothing Phone 1. It costs $399 for the 12GB/256GB model. It's available to buy from August 7, but you will need to put in a little effort to get one.\n\nIn the U.K., the Nothing Phone 2a Plus costs 399 British pounds and will first be available through Nothing's retail store in London from August 3. Nothing also states that further Phone 2a Plus availability will be announced in September.\n\nIs it a new Nothing phone?\n\nIn what's becoming a theme this year, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus makes us question whether it's truly a new phone. Nothing claims it's for those who demand more power, but that's also what the Phone 2 is for, making this for those who want only a bit more power but aren't sure they can handle too much extra. Nothing will continue selling the Phone 2a as well, which is slightly cheaper than the Plus, along with the Nothing Phone 2 and the CMF Phone 1.\n\nIt's an oddment, as on paper, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus looks like a lightly refreshed version of the Nothing Phone 2a rather than a new phone serving a new segment of buyers. That's fine, but the Phone 2a Plus treads a very fine line between rewarding new buyers and angering existing customers. The Phone 2a is just four months old, so anyone who bought one probably wasn't expecting a slightly better model to arrive so soon and for only a little more money. It may not give much confidence to immediately buy a new Nothing phone in the future.\n\nAt this stage, if you've held off buying a Phone 2a, then you're being rewarded, but if you did pick one up, then it'll look like you're on the wrong side of the deal. Luckily, the upgrades aren't likely to dramatically change the phone, so don't be too disappointed. We really liked the Phone 2a already, so you've got a good phone. But this just makes us wonder why the Nothing Phone 2a Plus has been pushed out in such a hurry. It's a confusing phone that's very much on trend for 2024.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_boxall@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Andy Boxall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Flip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Fold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Fold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobvoi", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobvoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide-angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nothing-phone-2a-plus-back-hand.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 5224, "textEnd": 5232}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 5429, "textEnd": 5437}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

After launching Nothing Phone 2a in March, the company will be unveiling its advanced version today. So far, the company has teased only a few specs like design, processor, and camera. And it is exciting to see what more the Nothing Phone 2a Plus will bring to the table. Nothing has successfully established itself in the market with its smartphones, featuring designs that make them immediately recognisable as a Nothing Phone. The Nothing Phone 2a Plus is expected to be priced under Rs 30,000 in India.\n\nThe launch of Nothing Phone 2a Plus will take place at 2.30PM IST today (July 31). The interested users can tune into Nothing's official YouTube channel and Nothing events page to stay updated on the launch.\n\nAhead of the launch, Nothing has recently shared the design of the upcoming Nothing Phone 2a Plus. The images reveal that the Phone 2a Plus has the same design as the original Phone 2a model. The new one comes in a grey colour, which looks shiny and attractive in the image. It continues to feature a boxy design with three LED lights at the back, positioned around the rear camera module. It basically has a metallic appearance. It is currently unknown whether it features a plastic or glass back panel.\n\nThe Plus model is just a more powerful version of the Phone 2a, which Nothing is planning to launch to give people more options at different price points with better performance. Under the hood, the new smartphone features the new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 SoC. The company has also confirmed that the Nothing Phone 2a Plus sports an upgraded 50-megapixel front camera, while the rear camera remains the same as its predecessor. According to the rumours, the smartphone will pack a 5,000mAh battery with 50W charging support.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus is anticipated to be priced a little higher than its predecessor, Nothing Phone 2a. It makes sense as well, since the upcoming device is an advanced version. The expected price of Nothing Phone 2a might be higher, but it may still remain in the sub-Rs 30,000 price segment.

After introducing CMF Phone 1 in the budget segment, the company is back again with a new upgrade from its 'a' series with the launch of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus. The latest smartphone from Nothing offers some under-the-hood upgrades with the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro processor, an improved 50-megapixel selfie camera, and better fast-charging support. However, the rest of the specifications and feature set remain similar to the Nothing Phone 2a.\n\nThe new Nothing Phone 2a Plus has a starting price of Rs. 29,999 for the 8GB RAM and 256GB storage variant, while the top-end variant with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage is priced at Rs. 31,999. Now that you are familiar with the price, let's take a closer look at what's new.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus comes with a transparent design, similar to other Nothing phones.\n\nThe design of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is carved from the same skin as the Phone 2a (Review) minus the new colour variation. The Grey colour option of the device looks slightly different from the Phone 2a, but the rest of the design aesthetics remain similar. You get the same transparent design and the Glyph Interface as the Phone 2a. Although, it is not necessarily a bad thing as it is a comfortable design to hold, we do want to see some new innovations as the company has already set the bar high for itself.\n\nThe front offers a slim bezel, which looks pleasing. Nothing has added a 6.7-inch flexible AMOLED display, which can also be found in the Phone 2a. The device features Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection, which is a welcome move. The display refreshes at 120Hz, offers a 240Hz touch-sampling rate, 1,300nits of peak brightness, and also supports 2,160Hz PWM dimming. It does look sharp and vibrant and you also have the option to customise the colour profile as per your taste.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus features a 6.7-inch flexible AMOLED display with a 120Hz screen refresh rate.\n\nThe significant difference between the Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus is in the performance department. The latter now comes loaded with a special MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro processor, which is exclusive to Nothing. The new chipset brings two performance, and six efficiency cores clocked up to 3.0GHz. The company claims that its new SoC offers 10 percent better performance than the Phone 2a, which is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro SoC.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus packs up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It runs NothingOS 2.6, which is based on Android 14, and has a clean user interface, which is also a strong suit of the phone. The company offers three years of Android updates and four years of security patches for the latest devices.\n\nComing to the cameras, the Phone 2a Plus offers a dual rear camera setup. The phone packs a 50-megapixel primary camera with a Sony GN9 sensor. This camera has an f/1.88 aperture, optical image stabilisation (OIS) + electronic image stabilisation (EIS), and offers 10x digital zoom. It also has a 50-megapixel ultra-wide camera with a Samsung JN1 sensor. This camera has an f/2.2 aperture and offers a 114-degree Field of View (FoV). On the front, the handset has an upgraded selfie camera compared to the Phone 2a. You now get a 50-megapixel Samsung JN1 sensor with f/2.2 aperture compared to the 32-megapixel shooter on Phone 2a.\n\nApart from this, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus features a 5,000mAh battery with 50W fast wired charging support and a 5W reverse wired charging feature. However, just like the Phone 2a, this one also lacks wireless charging.\n\nThe handset has a 5,000mAh battery with 50W fast-charging support.\n\nThat said, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus seems to be a slightly upgraded version of the Phone 2a.

The Phone 2a Plus features a MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G chip with a 50MP selfie camera, all backed by three years of software updates. While the Phone 2a Plus improves on some features of the original model, it may not be a significant upgrade for current Phone 2a owners.\n\nCarl Pei's Nothing has been in business for a few years now, and it is evident the company tends to deliver several models of the same hardware in a staggered fashion. One of its newest budget Android phones, the Nothing Phone 2a, released in July this year is no exception. The device launched in white and black colorways, with an India-exclusive blue hue added shortly thereafter. This was followed by a Special Edition colorway featuring a smattering of color on the minimalistic back panel, but Nothing just announced another addition to the Phone 2a range, boasting Plus branding, and it is more than just another two color options.\n\nRelated Nothing Phone 2 review: Finding its niche\n\nNothing's first US smartphone is (mostly) a success\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus adds two new colors to the already-vibrant Phone 2a catalog -- a metallic gray and an updated shade of black. Both colors feature the same ribbon cable-like design Nothing claims is inspired by Massimo Vignelli's subway map, but this time in a reflective silver or black color shared with the camera island surround masking the NFC coil. That contrasts nicely against the matte finish everywhere else. Like other Nothing models, the side rails are color-matched to the back panel, and all other elements like button placement and the Glyph Interface remain unchanged.\n\nThe biggest change in the Phone 2a Plus comes in the form of a new SoC -- MediaTek's 7350 Pro 5G, promising 10% faster CPU performance than a standard 2a. Nothing also claims the new chip has an ARM Mali-G610 MC4 GPU clocked at 1.3GHz, making the 2a Plus 30% faster than the standard 2a for gaming. Faster 50W charging on the Phone 2a Plus should also ensure you get to enjoy the hardware with lower downtime for recharges in between. Nothing says it's the company's largest battery to date, capable of powering the phone for an entire day after a 20-minute charge.\n\nClose\n\nThe new Phone 2a Plus also ditches the standard 32MP selfie camera for a new 50MP unit, matching the two rear cameras in terms of resolution. Although we noticed the camera results vary slightly between lenses when testing the Phone 2a, Nothing highlights that all three cameras can handle 50MP photo output, HDR photography, and 4K video recording.\n\nNothing plans to support the Phone 2a with three years of software updates and four years of security updates. However, it ships with Android 14 from the factory, instead of Android 13 like most phones in the same price bracket. Speaking of pricing, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus' sole model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will retail for $399 in the US through the company's US Beta Program, starting August 7 at 09:00 am ET. The company plans to offer the device in other markets, but those plans will be announced in September. For now, here are our first impressions of the device.\n\nEarly impressions with the Nothing Phone 2a Plus From AP Google Editor Taylor Kerns\n\nI haven't had the Nothing Phone 2a Plus long enough to write anything I'd call a review -- I've been using it for about four days -- but my early impressions are mostly good. This phone is extremely similar to the Nothing Phone 2a I reviewed this spring in a lot of ways: the overall size and shape, the display, the battery capacity, and the rear cameras are all unchanged from the 2a I'm used to.\n\nThere are a handful of updates that are appreciated, but don't seem to amount to a wildly different phone than the original Phone 2a. The 2a Plus has a new chipset in the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro, an upgrade from the Dimensity 7200 Pro in the 2a. It charges just a little faster, topping out at 50 watts to the 2a's 45-watt cap. It's also got a new 50-megapixel selfie camera -- an upgrade on paper, but resolution is hardly the whole picture when it comes to smartphone photography.\n\nNothing applied a new finish to some of the ornamental internal components on the back of the Phone 2a Plus, which gives them a metallic sheen. It does look nice, but it doesn't solve the problem I had with the Phone 2a's finish: the Phone 2a Plus's back is still coated in glossy plastic, and it still collects dust, fingerprints, and fine scratches like nobody's business. A more matte or frosted finish on the Phone 2a Plus's back would've gone a long way to make it look nicer, longer. The problem's not as pronounced on the gray Phone 2a Plus I've been using as it was on my black Phone 2a review unit, though.\n\nI'll need some more time with the Nothing Phone 2a Plus to render a formal verdict, but my initial feeling is that it's not much more than a slightly better version of the existing Phone 2a. The added processing power, charging speed, and front-facing camera resolution are definitely steps in the right direction, but none of them address my biggest issue with the original Phone 2a. The Phone 2a Plus isn't available at retail in the US; stateside, you can only get it through Nothing's Developer Program, where it'll run you $400. Price aside, it lacks the LTE and 5G bands to take full advantage of US networks, particularly Verizon's and AT&T's.\n\nSo far, the Phone 2a Plus seems like a decent option for people in the places where it's available at retail, but it's not a sensible upgrade for any Phone 2a owners. But because of its wireless network compatibility, for many users in the US, it'll be a non-starter.", "source": {"uri": "androidpolice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Police"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Vignelli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massimo Vignelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_13", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android 13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_4_receptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melanocortin 4 receptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Vision", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Vision", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nothing-phone-2a-plus-official-imagery-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3139, "textEnd": 3147}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

The exact pricing strategy and positioning will be revealed at the launch event.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus: Leaked Specifications\n\nNothing has confirmed that the Phone 2a Plus will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, marking the first smartphone launch featuring this chipset. The company claims this new processor will deliver nearly 10% faster CPU performance compared to the Phone 2a. The device will support up to 12GB of RAM, with an additional 8GB available through RAM Booster technology, which utilizes the phone's internal storage for expanded memory.\n\n\"With Phone (2a) Plus, we had the opportunity to create a beefed-up version for savvy users who demand more processing power (compared to Phone 2a), and we also made some improvements that didn't require hardware design changes. Finally, we wrapped it up with a new kick-ass variant that reflects these upgrades,\" the company's co-founder Akis Evangelidis shared on X.\n\nCamera capabilities are another highlight, with the Phone 2a Plus supporting 4K video recording on both the front and rear cameras, along with HDR image capture and HDR10+ playback. Although full specifications are yet to be officially disclosed, leaks suggest that the phone will feature a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The battery is rumoured to be a substantial 5,000mAh unit, supporting fast charging up to 50W.\n\nFor photography enthusiasts, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is expected to come with a significant upgrade in the front camera department, offering a 50-megapixel selfie camera, a notable improvement over the 32-megapixel camera found in the Phone 2a. As the launch date approaches, anticipation builds around how Nothing will differentiate the Phone 2a Plus in a competitive market and justify its positioning and pricing. The official unveiling on July 31 will provide the complete picture, including the full feature set and final pricing details, helping potential buyers decide whether the new model meets their needs and expectations.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HDR10+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones_and_Telegraphs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones and Telegraphs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/07/29/1466347-2a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 45, "textEnd": 52, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

What else was I supposed to think? The phone comes just months after the Phone 2a's launch. I was thinking there would just be slight improvements here and there. That's what the 'Plus' should mean. Anyway, I went for a briefing on the phone, and I took my doubts along. However, you can trust Nothing to surprise you when you least expect it.\n\nI already quite loved the Nothing Phone 2a (review), and that was a big reason why I was sceptical about the Nothing Phone 2a Plus. But after spending a few days using the Phone 2a Plus as my primary device, I can say that Nothing has knocked it out of the park with this one. Nothing took the feedback on the Phone 2a seriously, and has made a bunch of improvements to the phone including performance, NothingOS, charging speeds, among other things. But what really makes the Phone 2a Plus impressive, is its pricing.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus has been launched in India in two variants. The 8GB RAM model, which is exclusive to the Indian market, is priced at Rs 24,999 on the first day of sale, while the 12GB variant is priced at Rs 26,999 on the first day. This price goes up to Rs 27,999 and 29,999 respectively once the launch price offer is over. I think that's fantastic pricing. The smartphone would be a really solid choice in this price range. However, this also means that the Nothing Phone 2a Plus also kind of competes with its own Nothing Phone 2a. So, should you buy the Nothing Phone 2a or the Phone 2a Plus? Let's find out.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus: Verdict\n\nThis is a little unconventional, but I am going to share my verdict at the beginning of this review. I think the Nothing Phone 2a Plus makes sense for anyone looking for a smartphone in the sub-Rs 30,000 price segment. It has a good display, a gorgeous design that is sure to turn heads (trust me and go for the grey variant), better charging speeds, and decent cameras. You also get the NothingOS experience, which is neat, clean, intuitive, bloatware-free, and a little bit futuristic, all at the same time. Even if your budget is a little tight, I would ask you to push a little and go for the Phone 2a Plus over the Phone 2a. The smartphone promises 3 years of software updates and 4 years of security updates. Which means you are set for the next three years at least. However, if you are an existing Nothing Phone 2a user, I would suggest you wait for the Nothing Phone 3 or next year's Nothing a-series.\n\nIf you are in the first category wanting to buy a new phone, read along for a detailed review of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus has a pro-plus design\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus has made some small upgrades to the phone's design, but they have really brought out the whole transparent design aesthetic. The smartphone now uses a metallic finish for the exposed coils at the back of the phone, and the variant I have is grey. Together, the grey body and the metallic coils really make the phone's design. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this is probably one of the best-looking Nothing phones.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus continues to use a plastic body, the same as the Nothing Phone 2a, which also keeps the weight of the phone in check. The phone is very comfortable to hold and, despite the plastic back, it offers a good grip -- the matte finish sides get credit for that. The device is also lightweight, weighing 190g. At the back, the camera setup still looks the same with two horizontally-placed cameras that look like two eyes, which somehow remind me of Weebo from the film Flubber.\n\nOn the front, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus sports the same display as the Nothing Phone 2a, boasting a 6.7-inch fullHD+ AMOLED screen with a peak brightness of 1300 nits, a 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate, and a 240 Hz touch sampling rate. However, it now features an upgraded pulse-width modulation (PWM) dimming, which has been enhanced to 2160 Hz.\n\nI reviewed the Nothing Phone 2a earlier this year, and I have now been testing the Phone 2a Plus for a few days, and while the design of the phone is surely an upgrade, you don't actually see a big difference in the display. But that's fine, because the display still has good colours, with a good distinction in deep blacks and greys, and stays well legible even on a bright sunny day. Besides the colours of the display, the display has good responsiveness. The adaptive brightness is also very efficient. I never felt the need to re-adjust the brightness, whether I was scrolling through social media or playing Hogwarts Mystery on the phone.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus battery and charging speeds\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus features the same battery as the Nothing Phone 2a, which is 5,000mAh in capacity. However, what has improved is the charging speeds. The Phone 2a offered 33W charging speeds, which was a bit underwhelming, especially when smartphones in the similar price segment offer around 100W fast charging support. However, Nothing heard the feedback and bumped up the charging speed to 50W. Now that's not exactly great. It took me about 40-45 minutes to charge the phone from 0 to 100 per cent.\n\nNothing claims that charging the phone for just 20 minutes can give you a day's battery, but that has not been my experience. After charging the phone to full, after about 7 hours of usage, my battery is generally drained by 50 per cent. That's with low brightness settings, but with glyph, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the entire time. But the rest of the 50 per cent usually lasts me till the end of the day, which for me is around 10 pm. However, on days when I was testing the device with more graphic-intensive games or watching videos on it, the phone ran out of battery a few hours sooner.\n\nBasically, if you are a light user who attends to a few calls here and there and uses a few social media apps on the phone, you will easily be able to get a day's battery life from the phone. However, if you are a moderate to heavy user, who watches a lot of videos, plays games, multitasks on the phone, the Phone 2a Plus may need a second charge within a day.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus performance and UI have both become better\n\nOver the Nothing Phone 2a, the performance of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is definitely better. I have been using the Nothing Phone 2a Plus as my main device for about a week and I have no complaints. I haven't played many games on it, but when I played Asphalt 9 or Hogwarts Mystery, the experience was smooth with no lag. That was also true with the Phone 2a. But with the Phone 2a, long sessions of gaming or watching videos would significantly drain the battery. That does not happen on the Phone 2a Plus. Gaming on the Phone 2a Plus is also better, and that's probably because of the updates to the game mode.\n\nThe game mode on the Phone 2a Plus now has a tap function for quick access to the Game Dashboard during gameplay. Incoming calls now appear in a pop-up, with added support to reject third-party app calls and a one-tap callback feature after rejecting a call. The minimal display has been optimised to show more information in landscape mode, and notifications can be blocked during gameplay to reduce distractions.\n\nI also used the Phone 2a for multitasking between work and social media apps, taking multiple calls, using a personal hotspot, and running the Spotify app almost all day. Even with all that, the phone offered flawless performance.\n\nBesides the improvements to the chipset on the phone, Nothing has also made some upgrades to the NothingOS. The Nothing UI is definitely a big reason why I enjoyed the phone so much. NothingOS has everything just right -- it's intuitive, it's easy to use, it's bloatware-free, and it's customisable. It's near-stock, but it has its own identity. From the last time I was testing the Nothing Phone 2a, the OS has received several upgrades. There was an issue with missing icon packs that has been fixed. There are also new widgets on the phone which were added a while back, apparently, but I have only had the chance to test them with the Phone 2a Plus. My favourite being the camera preset widget, where you can preset which lens, which mode, which filter you want, so the camera will open with exactly those settings every time you tap on the widget. The one I have preset is the 50mm portraits widget.\n\nAdditionally, Nothing shared early access to a new widget on the Phone 2a Plus with us. Integrated with AI, the Nothing OS now includes a News Reporter widget. This will follow the ChatGPT integration. This widget provides a daily news digest read aloud by CFO Tim Holbrow. Users can select from eight genres, including business, entertainment, and technology, with AI summarising articles from trusted sources and converting them to audio. Each summary lasts one minute, with eight stories refreshed every morning. No signup is needed. If you are kicking your day off and have a busy morning, the widget is an excellent way to quickly get the top news of your interest in eight minutes. The widget is also quite easy to use. Once you have added it to your homepage, simply tap on the widget for Holbrow to read out news to you, you can pause it any time by simply tapping on the widget; the same process to resume it.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus has decent cameras but lacks a bit in selfie portraits\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus has received an upgrade on both the rear and front cameras. While at the back, the phone still uses a pair of 50-megapixel cameras at the back, but the sensors have now been bumped up to Samsung GN9 for the main camera and Samsung JN1 for the ultra-wide camera. On the front, the camera has been bumped from a 32-megapixel camera to a 50-megapixel one, which is the same Samsung JN1 sensor that's on the back.\n\nAs for the camera performance, I am largely happy with the Phone 2a Plus' cameras. I was actually able to get some lovely portrait shots of my pets and my humans. Thanks to the camera widgets I was using, I tried out the 50mm portrait the most. The camera isn't perfect -- you will notice images are a bit exposed in certain lighting sometimes despite AI processing, or you may see the post-processing adding some extra colours to an image -- however, the end result is generally pleasant, and Instagram-ready.\n\nVideos shot on the Phone 2a Plus are good and stable. Selfies are also pretty decent, and I think for most selfies I took, the AI processing only made it better. However, when it comes to portrait selfies, the camera needs a little improvement. In almost all portrait selfies I clicked, the phone's camera seemed to struggle with background separation. It has often blurred out an earring or little baby hair. But that is nothing a software update can not solve.\n\nIn short, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus camera is quite decent, especially for a sub-Rs 30,000 phone. Don't expect remarkable photography from the phone, but on a budget, the phone's camera gets the job done and gets you some good Instagram-ready shots.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nandini_yadav@indiatoday.in", "name": "Nandini Yadav", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphical widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulse-width modulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glyph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrolling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scrolling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hogwarts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones_and_Telegraphs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones and Telegraphs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/nothing-phone-2a-plus-315128946-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=CVChIJhrKPJDVg44aatyUlddPNBRJj2O", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

But, the significant price gap between the Phone 2a and the Phone 2 demanded to be filled, and now, the newly launched Phone 2a Plus makes it happen in a rather odd fashion.\n\nThe latest Nothing Phone 2a Plus is quite literally the Phone 2a's doppelganger, stealing almost everything on the design front. But, is it all that there is to the new device? If you are planning on spending Rs 27,999 for the Phone 2a Plus, should you go for it or settle for the Phone 2a instead? That's what this comparison should clear out for you, so let's get right into the comparison between Nothing Phone 2a Plus vs Nothing Phone 2a\n\nI've called the Phone 2a Plus a doppelganger of the Phone 2a (Review) for pretty solid reasons. Both phones are a tad too similar, starting from sharing the same dimensions, and weight, down to even the build quality. Yes, the Phone 2a Plus is made out of plastic as well, so don't expect to see a fancy glass back with a metal frame here.\n\nThe volume rocker and power buttons are still aluminum though, in case you're wondering. There's been no improvement in the IP rating either, with the Phone 2a Plus sporting the same IP54 resistance.\n\nHowever, the Phone 2a Plus is the shinier son, featuring a glossier metal-like finish on the internal coiling at the back. So, due to all that transparency, it certainly looks more premium and almost made me hallucinate it to be a glass back.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus also stays truer to its colors, with the brownish metallic glossy tinge coating the power button and volume rockers. But, the premium mirage is real until it's not.\n\nEverything else, from the camera module design to the three glyph lights at the back is borrowed by the Phone 2a Plus, down to the T. I really do wish that the Phone 2a Plus had something unique going for it to stand out, like the CMF Phone 1 (Review). Sadly, that's clearly not the case.\n\nIf you are not impressed by the design changes either, wait till you hear that both phones arrive with the EXACT SAME displays. Yes, there's a 6.7-inch flexible AMOLED with a 120Hz fast refresh rate support. There's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top of both displays, but I really do wish the Phone 2a Plus had at least used Victus here.\n\nThe display quality, although nice, is no upgrade, and that's a pretty big con of the Phone 2a Plus. The segment it belongs to has phones offering 1.5K displays, with a lot of them like the Realme GT 6T and Motorola Edge 50 Pro even offering curved panels. So, you can see where my disappointment is coming from.\n\nEven the brightness levels are identical here. Also, both phones have stereo speakers as well, with the receiver doubling down as the second speaker. So, for a detailed understanding of the displays, you can simply head over to my Phone 2a review.\n\nBoth phones come with Android 14-based Nothing OS right out of the box and will get to see Android 17. With the latest Nothing OS 2.6, both phones get to see cool new additions like a Game Mode, pop-up view for apps, and a couple of other features that were long pending.\n\nHowever, the Phone 2a Plus gets an extra AI News Reporter widget, which I'm a bit on the fence about. So, this particular widget offers you 1-minute AI-generated news story summaries from across 8 different genres. But, you get just 8 story summaries per day, rendering it pretty useless, if you ask me.\n\nEverything else remains the same, from those fluid app opening and closing animations to that truly bloatware-free experience. The bad thing is that there's still no haptic feedback integration in the UI, making it feel very hollow in comparison to a lot of other skins out there. Besides, the Nothing OS, although clean, is not nearly as feature-rich as skins like Motorola's Hello UI and OxygenOS.\n\nOne important point to note for Nothing Phone 2a Plus is that it starts with the 256GB variant as compared to the 128GB base variant of Nothing Phone 2a.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus arrives with the 4nm-based MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro SoC. Now, according to Nothing, this chipset is 20% faster than the Dimensity 7200 Pro powering the Phone 2a. The chipset on both phones is paired with up to 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256GB of UFS 2.2 storage. We've done an in-depth comparison of both chipsets. Check out Deminsity 7350 Pro vs Dimensity 7200 Pro. That's about it for the technicalities. I've done some proper testing, so let's take a look at the real deal now:\n\nWhen it comes to benchmarks, apart from the general AnTuTu and Geekbench tests, I also ran AITuTu for the phones as they come with a few AI features as well. Here's a rundown:\n\nSo, while you do get to see around the promised 20% increase in performance, it's not as impressive. Besides, it does not even reflect in any way during day-to-day usage and games. That brings us to the next sections.\n\nSince the performance increment is nothing spectacular on the Phone 2a Plus, you can't tell it apart from the Phone 2a. They perform exactly the same, no matter how many apps, games, and Chrome tabs I have open in the background. Both phones manage to handle it all without breaking much sweat.\n\nI remember how the Phone 2a used to lag back when it had first launched. But, after all those updates, it's very stable. So, it's good to see how stable the Phone 2a Plus is right out of the box, and I didn't face any stutters or lags during my time with it.\n\nThe gaming performance is exactly the same on both phones. You get to see the same settings and frames on all the games. Take a look:\n\nThe familiarity is deeply rooted, extending well into the camera systems of the two phones. You see the same 50MP Samsung JN9 primary sensor with OIS, coupled with another 50MP Samsung JN1 ultra-wide.\n\nSo, as much as I'd like to say there's some difference here, there's not. Both phones capture shots that are impossible to tell apart. The good thing is that, unlike the Phone 2a, the Phone 2a Plus doesn't have those terrible camera optimization issues at launch.\n\nFrom a good dynamic range to good details on both sensors as well as natural colors, these two phones have pretty commendable rear camera setups. There's a very slight color disparity in the two phones, with the Phone 2a Plus boosting the colors very slightly.\n\nHowever, when it comes to human subjects, both phones are very inconsistent in capturing skin tones. But, mostly, while the Phone 2a Plus lightens the skin tones, the Phone 2a darkens them out a little too much.\n\nHowever, it's the selfie shooter on the Phone 2a Plus that has gotten a bit of an upgrade, straight from 32MP to 50MP. But, the results are rather perplexing, with the Phone 2a's shooter capturing better selfies.\n\nWhile the Phone 2a Plus captures a bit more detail, it completely annihilates them with washed-out colors and strangely grainy photos. The Phone 2a Plus selfie shooter definitely needs quite a bit of work. On the other hand, the Phone 2a captures pretty natural skin tones.\n\nAs for videos, both phones can shoot at up to 4K 30FPS through the rear setup, and at up to 1080p 60FPS through the front.\n\nAt this point, I think we're done being surprised. Yes, the battery capacity is the same as well, with both phones packing a 5000mAh unit. And, they both end up delivering similar screen-on-times as well, averaging at around 7 hours.\n\nHowever, the Phone 2a Plus offers 50W fast charging compared to the Phone 2a's 45W charging tech. That barely offers any significant difference in the charging speeds, with a 5-minute difference at most. Both phones will take you around an hour to fully charge.\n\nYou know it's not an upgrade when a phone feels more like a limited edition extension of the base model. And, well, that's the case here, with the phones sharing almost (if not over) 85% similarity in terms of both design and specifications.\n\nThe Rs 4,000 price jump from the Phone 2a's base 8GB/128GB variant (Rs 23,999) to the Phone 2a Plus' 8GB/256GB base variant (Rs 27,999) is just not justified. You get double the storage, sure. But, that's not what we're here for. These are not supposed to be the same phones, and the Phone 2a Plus is supposed to be a proper upgrade.\n\nBut, the weak upgrades in the design, performance, camera department (which is also unoptimized right now, to remind you), and the addition of 5W reverse wired charging support are just not enough. This was a big miss by Nothing, and they could have easily made this a great device by simply the addition of a better IP rating, build quality, and a solid glass back + metal frame build.\n\nWell, it is what it is, and if you ask me, settle for the Phone 2a instead. Then, get your hands on a good-quality charger preferably Nothing's own 45W GAN charger (Buy Here), which costs Rs 2,500, which will still cost you less than getting the Phone 2a Plus. So, there you go. That wraps up this comparison.\n\nOtherwise, this price segment offers several other good options like Motorola Edge 50 Pro and the top-of-the-segment OnePlus Nord 4. Yes, we did pit the Phone 2a Plus against the all-metal Nord 4, check out the Nothing Phone 2a Plus vs OnePlus Nord 4 comparison.\n\nNow, if you have any related queries, do drop them in the comments down below and I'll get right back to you. Also, what's your take on the comparison? I'd like to hear your side of the argument, so do let me know of that too.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sagnik_das_gupta@beebom.com", "name": "Sagnik Das Gupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glyph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modular programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Realme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPDDR", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LPDDR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_6T", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus 6T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Flash_Storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal Flash Storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nohting-Phone-2a-Plus-vs-Phone-2a-comparison-featured-image.jpg?w=1250&quality=75", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

A few years and a few phones later, we finally have the answer in the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus, a device that, for lack of a better description, seems entirely pointless.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) launched early this year as a pretty impressive value for the money. The $349 device offered specs better than the price suggested, with excellent hardware and software too. It also served as a jumping-off point for the CMF Phone 1 which took a lot of the aspects that made Phone (2a) great and brought them to an even cheaper $199 price point. Both have easily been among my favorite phones of 2024 so far.\n\nToday, Nothing has announced the Phone (2a) Plus, an upgraded version of the Phone (2a).\n\nKind of.\n\nHere's everything that's actually new on Nothing Phone (2a) Plus:\n\nThat's a short list!\n\nIt has the same display as Phone (2a), the same rear cameras, the same battery size, and the same IP54 dust/water resistance. It also has the same hardware, though Nothing notes this device is made from a lot of recycled materials, including taking plastic waste from the production of the since-replaced Ear (2) to repurpose it for Phone (2a) Plus which is actually really cool.\n\nThe design update is also quite pretty and a huge step up from the Phone (2a) with some flashy metal under the plastic back. Truly, it's striking, and I wish the original release looked this great.\n\nSo why does this exist?\n\nIt's marginally faster, has a marginally better camera, and has some flashy hardware. At a mere $50 upcharge, there's no reason, at least from my perspective, for both the Phone (2a) and the Phone (2a) Plus to co-exist. Nothing says that Phone (2a) will still be sold and continue to be restocked, but the company did explain that it \"saw an opportunity\" to improve on Phone (2a) for \"power users\" by providing better performance and a better camera, still at an accessible price point while Nothing Phone (3) is held back to 2025. But, personally, I'm struggling with that argument just because the list of improvements is so tiny. Performance is the biggest upgrade, but I never really had much to complain about with Phone (2a) in the first place, and a mid-range MediaTek chip isn't going to please the \"power users\" Nothing is claiming to build this device for.\n\nDoes that mean you shouldn't buy Nothing Phone (2a) Plus? By no means am I saying that. Based on my very limited use thus far it seems like a fine device. As the specs imply, it's basically the same as what I experienced with Phone (2a) back in March and April. For the most part quick, but with the occasional hiccup. It also gets the same pretty decent update policy, launching with Android 14 and getting two years of major updates and three years of security patches.\n\nWhat it really boils down to for me on the Phone (2a) Plus is that there's such a tiny difference between the Phone (2a) and the Plus that, unless you've been waiting for the right time to buy Phone (2a), I can't imagine anything on this device is new enough to push anyone to suddenly say, \"hey, I think I want to buy a Nothing Phone (2a)\" if they didn't feel that way already. It also feels way too soon to launch this device, seeing as Phone (2a) just went on sale in March, merely four months ago.\n\nUltimately, there's just nothing here, at least nothing more than there already was.\n\nNothing Phone (2a) Plus will cost $399 in the US as a part of a \"beta program,\" and will be sold widely in the UK for \u00a3399 and in Europe (a price was not provided) too, also a tiny price bump over the existing, barely different Nothing Phone (2a), and around double the cost of the also shockingly good CMF Phone 1 by Nothing. That's for the 12GB + 256GB variant. The Phone (2a) Plus will be sold in both gray and black colors, the gray pictured throughout this article - again, this updated design really is stunning.\n\nIn the US, the Phone (2a) Plus will have limited carrier support, with the best option being T-Mobile's network. 5G is unsupported on both AT&T and Verizon.\n\nNothing says Phone (2a) Plus will be available in Europe and the UK starting on August 3, and in the US on August 7.", "source": {"uri": "9to5google.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Google"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_schoon@9to5google.com", "name": "Ben Schoon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterproofing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterproofing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/07/nothing-phone-2a-plus-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 4207, "textEnd": 4215}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 4234, "textEnd": 4242}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Now, it's adding the Nothing Phone 2a Plus to its growing lineup.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a stands out for its great value, offering both affordability and a unique look. Its Glyph Light system and customizable software give it a special edge. With strong photography features, solid performance, and plenty of personalization options, it's easily among our top picks in the budget Android phone segment.\n\nThe hype around Nothing's most recent mid-range smartphone might have set expectations for something groundbreaking. However, the Plus model looks a lot like the Phone 2a. It features the same transparent back, showing off the wireless charging components, and the signature Glyph Light system that defines the series.\n\nWhat sets the Phone 2a Plus apart is its exclusive MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, making it the first phone in the world to use this chipset. It also comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.\n\nMediaTek's latest chipset is built for entertainment, especially for gamers. With advanced TSMC 4nm Gen 2 technology, it features 8 cores running up to 3.0GHz, making the CPU almost 10% faster than the Phone 2a. This means smoother multitasking, faster app switching, and quicker content loading.\n\nApart from the new specs, the Phone 2a Plus looks almost identical to the Phone 2a. There aren't any obvious visual differences between the two based on official renders from Nothing.\n\nThe new phone features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 1300 nits. It has the same 5,000mAh battery as the regular model but charges faster at 50W compared to the standard model's 45W. According to Nothing, it can reach a full day's power in under 20 minutes, which is nearly 10% faster than the Phone 2a.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus comes with a 50MP dual-lens camera (main and ultrawide) in the center of a circular panel, three Glyph lights, and a wavy pattern on the bottom half. These features are also present in the standard model.\n\nOn the front, the Phone 2a Plus has a 50MP selfie camera, an upgrade from the Phone 2a's 32MP front camera.\n\nThe device comes with Android 14 and Nothing OS 2.6, with promises of three years of major Android updates and four years of security updates.\n\nThe color options are metallic grey and an updated black. While it's a good-looking phone, it doesn't stand out much in appearance. You might easily mistake the Phone 2a Plus for the Phone 2a when you see them out and about.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus officially hits the market on August 3 in London for \u00a3399. The first place you can grab it is at Nothing's Store Soho, making it the initial launch spot worldwide.\n\nIn the US, the Phone 2a Plus will be available in grey for $399.

The smartphone features an upgraded camera system, somewhat newer design, improved display, and better charging speeds as compared to the Nothing Phone 2a. And just like the Nothing Phone 2a (review), the London-based company has done a great job with the pricing of the smartphone. The Nothing Phone 2a has been launched at a starting price of Rs 24,999, but this is for a limited period of time. Read on for all the details.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus has been launched in two RAM variants. Both sport 256GB storage, but one offers 8GB RAM and the other comes with a 12GB RAM option. The 8GB RAM variant is exclusively for the Indian market. In the US, UK and other markets, Nothing will only sell the 12GB RAM variant.\n\nComing to the pricing, the 8GB RAM variant is priced at Rs 24,999 on the first day of sale, post which the pricing of the phone will go up to Rs 27,999, and the 12 GB model will be available for Rs 26,999 on the first day of sale, which will revert to Rs 29,999 once the launch price is discontinued.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus will be available for purchase starting August 7 in India. Interestingly, the smartphone will be made available first in the Indian market, and will be available for other markets only in September.\n\nNothing told India Today Tech that for the Phone 2a Plus, the company used the new Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset, which they developed together with MediaTek keeping specific needs in mind. While the Nothing Phone 2a Plus isn't being advertised as a gaming smartphone, Nothing is confident that the smartphone can easily handle light to moderate gaming.\n\nThe chipset features TSMC's 4nm Gen 2 technology, with 8 cores running up to 3.0 GHz. Nothing says this is almost 10 per cent higher than Phone 2a. The chipset is accompanied by ARM Mali-G610 GPU for graphics. Running up to 1.3 GHZ, Nothing claims that the Phone 2a Plus is 30 per cent faster than the Phone 2a.\n\nWhile the Nothing Phone 2a Plus has the same battery capacity as the Phone 2a, which is a 5,000mAh battery, the charging speeds have been upgraded from 33W to 50W.\n\nAdditionally, the camera system on the Nothing Phone 2a Plus has also been upgraded. The smartphone now has three 50-megapixel cameras, one on the front for selfies, and two on the rear. Breaking down the camera specs, the main camera on the back is a 50-megapixel sensor with a f/1.88 lens, which is paired with an ultra-wide 50-megapixel sensor with a 114-degree field of view. All three sensors support direct 50-megapixel photo output, and support HDR photo and 4K video recording.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus has the same FHD+ 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a peak brightness of 1300 nits and support for 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate, and a 240 Hz touch sampling rate. However, what has been upgraded is the pulse-width modulation (PWM) dimming, which has now been tuned to 2160 Hz.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus comes with NothingOS 2.6 out-of-the-box, which is based on Android 14. Nothing also promises 3 years of software updates and 4 years security updates.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus also comes with ChatGPT integration that can be setup via the Nothing X app.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulse-width modulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field of view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones_and_Telegraphs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones and Telegraphs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/nothing-phone-2a-plus-315618239-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=jRMg0kTPU.84UCxAOdWb9nHC22yNu3QY", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1367, "textEnd": 1375}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Well, this isn't the first Nothing Phone 2a Plus teaser, and previously the company has revealed that it has a new 50MP front camera (in place of the 2a's 32MP one), though the rear cameras are once again 50MP.\n\nThe main change though is likely to be in performance, with the Nothing Phone 2a Plus using a MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset, which is said to be almost 10% faster than the Dimensity 7200 Pro in the standard Nothing Phone 2a.\n\nThere's still a lot we don't know about the Nothing Phone 2a Plus, so hopefully there will be some other upgrades too - perhaps to its screen or battery - and ideally without too much of a price rice.

Following the March debut of the Nothing Phone (2a), the new model is expected to bring several enhancements. The UK-based company has previously disclosed details about the chipset and RAM of the forthcoming device. Recently, they unveiled information about its camera system and provided a sneak peek of the rear camera design.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus will feature a dual rear camera setup, boasting two 50MP sensors, mirroring the configuration of the original Phone (2a). However, the front camera is set to receive a significant upgrade. Unlike the Phone (2a), which has a 32MP front camera, the (2a) Plus will come with a 50MP front-facing sensor.\n\nA post on X confirming these camera details also showcased a teaser of the rear camera design. The layout, which includes the sensor placement and a Glyph Interface LED unit, bears a strong resemblance to the rear camera module of the Phone (2a).\n\nAs per several media reports, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 chipset coupled with up to 12GB of RAM. Leaks suggest that the phone will be available in two configurations: 8GB RAM with 256GB storage and 12GB RAM with 256GB storage. It will reportedly come in Black and Grey color variants. The handset is also expected to sport a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and an in-display fingerprint sensor, similar to its predecessor.\n\nAdditionally, the leak indicates that the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus may support 50W wired fast charging, an improvement over the 45W fast charging capability of the Phone (2a). Like the existing model, the Plus variant is likely to be equipped with a 5,000mAh battery.\n\nAs the launch date approaches, anticipation is building around the enhancements and new features that the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus will bring to the market.\n\n3.6 Crore Indians visited in a single day choosing us as India's undisputed platform for General Election Results.

But, surprisingly, the Phone 2a Plus looks more or less like its younger sibling, with a couple of changes and a price tag of Rs 27,999 (which is Rs 4,000 more than Phone 2a's base variant). So, is it a worthy upgrade or just a glorified Phone 2a? So, I got my hands on the device a week ahead of its launch, and here's a detailed review of Nothing Phone 2a Plus to answer this very question!\n\nBefore getting into the review, here's a look at the Phone 2a Plus' specs for your reference:\n\nGoing in, I knew that the Phone 2a Plus' box contents wouldn't be anything spectacular. You get the usual transparent SIM ejector, Type C to Type C cable and some booklets alongside the unit itself. So, again, no charger in the box. Sigh.\n\nNow, I have with me the Grey variant of the phone and it's quite good looking. Although it borrows 95% of the Phone 2a's design wizardry, it's the remaining shining 5% that makes all the difference here.\n\nThe internal coiling is now metal-like glossier and the textures are more evident now, giving it this sophistication that the Phone 2a lacked. Now, this very metallic finish makes the coiling appear brownish from most angles. It's only when light directly falls on the coiling at certain angles that it unveils the true silver shade. Pretty cool, actually.\n\nSo, while the back and frame are still plastic, the subtle yet important changes in design made me look past that (a bit). I also liked that the Phone 2a Plus retained the matte texture at the frame to keep it as grippy as ever.\n\nBut, in all honesty, a glass back with a metal frame would have certainly been more appreciated, especially since the Phone 1 had launched around the same price back in the day. Most importantly, competing phones like the Motorola Edge 50 Pro arrive with a metal frame as well. Besides, the buttons are made out of aluminum as well, so just might add a metal frame to the design recipe.\n\nAnd, as expected, it keeps the device from wobbling on a desk. When holding it in landscape mode as well, your fingers don't hit the cameras, and I have big hands. So, that's good to see.\n\nNow, the classic Black variant is pretty good-looking too, but just like with the Phone 2a, it masks the internal components a bit, keeping the transparency from truly blossoming.\n\nSadly, the Phone 2a Plus doesn't arrive with any upgrades in terms of display. You see the same 6.7-inch flexible AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The peak brightness remains the same as well, hitting 1750 nits or so, which is more than the company's claim of 1300 nits. There are no visible differences either, indoors or outdoors.\n\nBut, since the competition is offering curved 1.5K displays, the expectation was honestly a bit high there. Moreover, while there's Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top, Victus would have made more sense. This is because, one - this is an upgrade over the 2a, and two - phones like the Realme GT 6T offer even Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.\n\nAs for the overall multimedia experience, it's exactly the same as its younger sibling. So, for a comprehensive understanding, you can check out my Nothing Phone 2a Review.\n\nOut of the box, the Phone 2a Plus runs on Android 14-based Nothing OS 2.6, and there's nothing new here. The Nothing OS 2.6 had arrived with the CMF Phone 1 and we got to see some pretty nice additions like a dedicated Game Mode, a pop-up view for apps (finally), an AI Vivid Mode, and more.\n\nHowever, with the Phone 2a Plus, all you get is a new AI news reporter widget that offers you AI-generated 1-minute story summaries from across 8 different genres. Also, there's an 8-story-per-day summary cap on this, so yep, not going to be using it, are we?\n\nAs for the software experience, it's much of a muchness as the conventional Nothing OS experience on the CMF Phone 1 (Review) and Phone 2a - squeaky clean and super fluid. From opening and closing apps to multitasking, the UI is very satisfying to browse through, thanks to the seamless animations.\n\nHowever, again, you don't see any haptic integration with the UI actions, which we'll hopefully get to see someday on this skin. Overall, it's good to see Nothing stick to its bloatware-free promise.\n\nFirst things first, Nothing Phone 2a Plus offers 256GB in the base variant, as compared to 128GB in the Phone 2a.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus uses the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset, which is a slight upgrade. In comparison to the Phone 2a's Dimensity 7200 Pro, this chipset is roughly 10% faster, thanks to clock speeds of up to 3GHz over 2.8GHz. We've compared Dimensity 7350 Pro vs Dimensity 7200 Pro to give you an idea of the performance increment over the predecessor.\n\nIn addition, the processor is paired with up to 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 256GB of UFS 2.2 storage. I'd have liked to see UFS 3.1 at least in this segment, for that's the most this processor can support anyway. Bit of a bummer there. But anyway, how does it perform during daily usage as well as in benchmarks and games? Take a look:\n\nNothing OS has always been a pleasure to use, be it on the Phone 2a or even the more budget CMF Phone 1. So, ultimately, thanks to a good software experience, my daily usage went by pretty smoothly too.\n\nHowever, initially, with the Phone 2a, I noticed quite a few stutters, lags, and UI optimization issues, which are not visible on its elder sibling. The processor is also capable enough to get you through some extensive multitasking.\n\nTo test it out, I had exactly 20 apps open in the background, which also included Genshin Impact, Asphalt Legends Unite as well as Chrome with 25 tabs open and displaying webpages. Despite that, 18 of those apps reloaded from where I had left them, including both games. So, RAM management is still pretty good in my books.\n\nMoving on to benchmarks, I ran AnTuTu, Geekbench, 3DMark, and all those tests to give you a technical understanding of how the phone performs. Here's a look at the numbers:\n\nIn terms of gaming, it translates into offering the same experience in terms of graphics settings and FPS as the Phone 2a. I tried Genshin Impact, Asphalt Legends Unite, Warzone Mobile, and CoD Mobile on the Phone 2a Plus, and here's a look at the kind of settings you get out of it:\n\nThe camera performance has also not changed, for the rear camera sensors remain the same. The primary 50MP Samsung JN9 sensor and 50MP JN1 ultra-wide do a good job of capturing details and dynamic range both during the day and at night.\n\nColor accuracy is also pretty good, with the primary sensor mostly capturing natural shades and hues. However, just like on the Phone 2a, there's an evident color disparity between the primary and ultra-wide shots, with the latter coming off as slightly more saturated. For more details, again, refer to my Phone 2a review.\n\nSelfies are a different story. While it does arrive with a better 50MP Samsung JN1 selfie shooter over the Phone 2a's 32MP, it's not as optimized. From strangely washed-out and blown-out shots to selfies getting easily blurry, the consistency and stability are all over the place right now. From the looks of it, it's certainly not as good as the Phone 2a's shooter. But, it's nothing that can't be fixed with a software update.\n\nTalking about videos, nothing has changed on this front either. It can capture at up to 4K 30FPS, as well as at 1080p 60FPS. The front shooter is limited to 1080p 60FPS, same as the Phone 2a.\n\nWhile the battery capacity remains the same on the Phone 2a Plus packing a 5000mAh unit, there has been a slight upgrade in the charging speeds. You now get 50W wired charging instead of the 45W cap on the Phone 2a.\n\nThere's also support for 5W reverse wired charging this time around, which can be useful in certain scenarios like charging your earbuds, smartwatch, or even other phones. That's a nice touch, but that's about it.\n\nThe screen-on-time is similar to the 2a though, that is, around 7 hours. The 5W increase in charging speeds is not a big upgrade either, just being around 5 or so minutes faster. It still takes around an hour to fully charge.\n\nThe lack of a better display, build quality or bigger battery is a big letdown with the Phone 2a Plus. I was also expecting a better processor in this price segment, especially since Nothing has been taking gaming seriously with the addition of a dedicated Game Mode with Nothing OS 2.6.\n\nWith better phones like the Motorola Edge 50 Pro, OnePlus Nord 4, and Realme GT 6T, that offer a better display, cameras, battery backup, and performance, it's nearly impossible to recommend the Phone 2a Plus over them.\n\nWhile the software experience argument can still be won by the Phone 2a Plus, to experience just Nothing OS, you don't even need to spend as much. The budget CMF Phone 1 offers the exact same experience.\n\nWant something a bit more premium? Get the Phone 2a instead, and you won't miss a thing. Besides, other skins like Motorola's Hello UI, Xiaomi's HyperOS, and OnePlus' OxygenOS are much more feature-rich. No charger in the box is also a dealbreaker, whilst the competition is throwing in a good quality case as well alongside the charger.\n\nWhile the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is far from being a bad phone, it doesn't justify its existence as an upgrade of Rs 4,000 over the Phone 2a. Even the 256GB variant of the Phone 2a costs Rs 2,000 less. Ultimately, the Phone 2a Plus is just a mere DLC to the Phone 2a that you can choose to easily skip out on without remorse.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sagnik_das_gupta@beebom.com", "name": "Sagnik Das Gupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SIM card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Flash_Storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universal Flash Storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texture mapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer multitasking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genshin Impact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Realme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPDDR", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LPDDR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xiaomi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorola"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nothing-Phone-2a-Plus-featured-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It will be available on Flipkart and Nohting's website.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ampere hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_wide_angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultra wide angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flipkart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/sci-tech/technology/z15bni/article68468136.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/wdyruwlq.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

But I can't help but feel that this is what the Phone (2a) should have been from the beginning, and that the Plus model doesn't need to exist.\n\nI was excited to get my hands on the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus, a sibling to the popular Phone (2a). This was mostly down to the design, to be perfectly honest.\n\nWith less than six months on the market (at the time of writing), Phone (2a) now gets a more premium companion aimed at gamers and performance enthusiasts.\n\nNothing wants to make it clear that this is not a successor but a complementary model with a refreshed design and upgraded internals.\n\nBut with just an \u00a380 price difference in the UK, can both phones co-exist in the competitive mid-range market? I spent a week testing the Phone (2a) Plus to find out just how good it is.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus stands out with its new metallic design scheme, featuring see-through elements enhanced with a shiny silver treatment on the model I tested. There's also a black version, which retains the metallic finish.\n\nPersonally, I'm a big fan of this design. It looks super premium, and far more expensive than this device costs. In a weird way, it reminds me of the Natural Titanium colour on the iPhone 15 Pro, which I use every day. So for my taste, this was a perfect match.\n\nI've also not really seen the metallic highlights before, especially with a transparent back. This is another truly unique design, in typical Nothing fashion. The metallic finish really comes alive when held under different angles, as the light bounces off the surfaces.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus retains the scaled-back Glyph Interface lighting system and polycarbonate case from the Phone (2a).\n\nI don't think you lose too much from having the smaller section of glyph lighting. They can fade in and out or only partly light up to show volume or charging progress. The dual rear cameras, reminiscent of eyes (which was done on purpose, I'm told), remain a distinctive feature.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus's 6.7-inch AMOLED display offers Full HD+ resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 1300 nits of claimed peak brightness.\n\nThese specs are identical to the Phone (2a) - nothing has changed here. The AMOLED panel rivals high-end phones, even if its 2.4K (2412\u00d71084) resolution isn't quite top-tier. Content is sharp and clear, and unless you've got eagle eyes, you won't spot the difference from a 1440p or 4K screen.\n\nThanks to the 120Hz refresh rate, everything feels silky smooth. It's perfect for browsing, emailing, binge-watching, or doomscrolling. The default 'Dynamic' mode cleverly adjusts between 30-120Hz to save battery, but it doesn't drop to 1Hz since it's not an LTPO display. You can still manually set it to 60- or 120Hz if you fancy.\n\nFrom the front, the Phone (2a) Plus is a stunner, with its flat display and slim, symmetrical bezels. I think the symmetrical bezels and rounded corners provide a slightly more immersive viewing experience, as the black border is less noticeable.\n\nHowever, visibility still isn't its strong suit; at just under 700 nits of brightness on the regular, it struggles in bright sunlight. This is very similar to what we said about the regular Phone (2a).\n\nInside the screen, there's an optical fingerprint sensor, that you'll find on most Android smartphones these days. On Phone (2a), we found that it was fast and reliable, unlocking the phone 95% of the time. But on this new Phone (2a) Plus, I've been having some problems. The device didn't seem to recognise my fingerprint after first setting it up.\n\nAfter some resets and an update, all seems to be fixed, so this may have been a software bug. Note that face unlock is also available through Android, but it's less secure as it just works using a picture of your face. It also can't be used to authenticate purchases or log in to banking apps.\n\nThe speaker setup remains unchanged, delivering clear and balanced audio that makes it well-suited for media consumption. Phone (2a) Plus comes with dual stereo speakers, featuring a downward-firing grille and earpiece combo.\n\nIt delivers punchy sound without distortion at high volumes. However, the bass is lacking, so it's not ideal for movies or if you really like your music. But it's fine for social media and YouTube.\n\nUnder the hood, the Phone (2a) Plus is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset. This was designed specifically for the device, so it works rather well.\n\nIt promises superior performance for apps and games compared to the Dimensity 7200 Pro in the Phone (2a). Most scores position it ahead of competitors like the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion and Samsung Galaxy A55. And, of course, it scores above Phone (2a).\n\nI will say that performance isn't leaps and bounds better. When you're scrolling through apps or switching from one app to another, you can't feel much difference.\n\nBut when you start to multitask with multiple apps or play some games, you can feel that things are snappier, frame rates look better, and everything is just a bit smoother. You'll easily get through a day of regular use with this phone.\n\nThis was with the Phone (2a) Plus model with 12GB of RAM. While that's the only spec available in Europe, there is an 8GB RAM variant in India. I can't imagine there's a big drop-off on the entry-level 8GB version.\n\nPerformance is undoubtedly a strength of the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus at this price point. But, and I'll say it again, this is where Phone (2a) should have landed the first time.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus retains the dual 50MP rear cameras from its predecessor, ensuring consistent image quality.\n\nYou won't find a telephoto camera, macro lens or dedicated depth sensor, though. While this doesn't sound all that impressive, it's pretty on par for other handsets at this price point. And it means the Phone (2a) Plus is on a par with Phone (2) and Phone (2a).\n\nIn good lighting, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus produces decent shots with strong detail and dynamic range. However, its image processing makes photos overly vibrant and contrasty, lacking true-to-life accuracy. It would be great if you could switch this off or dial it down in the settings, but no such luck.\n\nExposure can be inconsistent, particularly with the sky, though it performs better in lower-light conditions. The long-exposure night mode brightens dark images effectively with minimal noise.\n\nPortrait mode delivers well-exposed subjects with a nice background blur, though edge detection can be hit and miss. The ultrawide lens maintains quality with a 114\u00b0 field of view but has more washed-out colours. There's no optical zoom, and digital zoom beyond 2x becomes very grainy very quickly.\n\nFor video, it shoots up to 4K at 30fps, but 1080p at 30fps is the default and should suffice for most users. Footage is decent, with OIS on the main lens providing stability. But I'd stick to using another device with a better camera setup if you're planning on watching your videos on a larger screen.\n\nIn a surprise upgrade, the front-facing camera also becomes a 50MP sensor, enhancing selfie quality. The selfie camera can take vibrant, detailed shots, even in portrait mode, despite cropping in more than most smartphones.\n\nDespite the performance boost from the new chipset, Nothing claims the 5000mAh battery will still last all day.\n\nWhen the time comes to charge, the Phone (2a) Plus supports 50W wired charging, an improvement over the 45W in the Phone (2a). This charges the newer phone to 100% in just under two hours. While both come with a cable, neither includes a charging brick in the box.\n\nI must say that the charging cable is one of my favourites, thanks to matching metal ends. Wireless charging is absent again. While it's most likely to keep costs down, it is heavily missed.\n\nIn my usage, the battery comfortably lasted through a day of heavy use, and the rapid charging feature was a lifesaver during busy days. On one occasion, I was stuck without a charger for the night. It managed to give me an hour of battery in the morning before finally giving up, after I switched on 'Power Saver' mode.\n\nRunning Nothing OS 2.6 on Android 14, the Phone (2a) Plus offers a minimalistic, widget-based UI that's free from bloatware.\n\nIf you've never used a Nothing handset before, the software experience is quite different to what you'll find on any other Android phone. Nothing says it wants to \"reduce distractions and encourage intentional smartphone use\", with its Glyph Interface at the forefront.\n\nThe software also features a monochrome theme and icon pack, steering clear of the usual bright colours. Personally, I'm a big fan of this aesthetic, and Nothing is clearly going for a more retro vibe, though it might not appeal to everyone.\n\nYou can switch to the stock Pixel look if you'd like during set-up. While new apps often appear in their original colours, the Nothing Icon Pack can fix this. Additionally, Nothing has created 22 custom widgets for the home and lock screens.\n\nElsewhere, there's also a new News Reporter widget, which uses AI to aggregate daily news across various categories. While convenient, the AI-generated voice can sound monotonous. But ChatGPT integration is a standout feature, providing quick answers and seamless interaction directly from the home screen.\n\nJust like the Phone (2a), Nothing is offering three major OS updates and four years of security updates on the Phone (2a) Plus. That's a decent commitment, and it's unlikely many people are planning to use the phone beyond 2028.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is attractively priced at \u00a3399 in the UK, making it a competitive option.\n\nIt'll initially available in the UK with a limited drop at Nothing's London Soho store on August 3rd, a US developer program will also launch, with global pricing and availability to follow in September.\n\nWhen it goes go on sale, you'll be able to buy one from the Nothing website and potentially via Amazon.\n\nIf the Phone (2a) is anything to go by, the phone won't be available to buy on contract, so you'll need to get it outright and pair with a SIM deal. Use the widget below to find an option that suits you.\n\nHowever, there's plenty of strong mid-range competition, and not just from the regular Phone (2a) (from \u00a3319). The Samsung Galaxy A55 (from \u00a3439), Redmi Note 13 Pro+ (\u00a3449), OnePlus Nord 4 (from \u00a3429) and Poco F6 (from \u00a3399) are all compelling alternatives.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus offers a compelling mix of distinctive design, strong performance and excellent value.\n\nIt stands out with its silver accents and powerful chipset, making it an ideal choice for gamers and everyday users alike. The bump in performance compared to the regular Phone (2a) is noticeable, too.\n\nHowever, I still maintain that this handset didn't need to exist. This chipset and upgraded selfie camera should have been in the original Phone (2a), even if it meant the slightly higher price point. Now, there's an extra device that makes Phone (2a) harder to justify.\n\nWhile the lack of wireless charging is a drawback, the overall package is impressive for its price point.\n\nIf you're looking for a stylish phone with great performance and an affordable price, the Phone (2a) Plus is definitely worth considering. It's certainly the device I'd pick at this price point, even if just for looks alone.", "source": {"uri": "techadvisor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Advisor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_jewiss@techadvisor.com", "name": "Connor Jewiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glyph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-temperature_polycrystalline_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-temperature polycrystalline silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1440p", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1440p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polycarbonate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Titanium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital image processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Soho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.techadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nothing-phone-2a-plus-review-15.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 9812, "textEnd": 9822}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The Phone (2a) was recently launched, and now they've come up with the Plus variant of the same. Weirdly, though, Nothing claims that the Phone (2a) Plus is not an upgrade over the outgoing model. It's hard to believe that it follows the same design language. However, there have been few changes inside the casing. For one, it comes with a newer processor and a better selfie camera. But do all these differences warrant a price hike? While the full review is still in progress, here are my initial impressions of this phone.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is available in two colourways: Grey and Black. I have the former with me. The back panel has a metallic finish, reminiscent of the Nothing Phone (1). While the Phone (1) had many glyph lights, the (2a) Plus has only a few, similar to the Nothing Phone (2a). That said, these are just as fun to look at.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus features a sleek design and feels incredibly lightweight. I enjoyed using it continuously without needing breaks. The side frame has a texture similar to a silicone cover. Despite its price, the phone feels quite premium.\n\nThe coil design on the back reminds me of the mazes we used to solve in newspapers; I keep playing with it. The screws on this phone are also visible. Overall, the (2a) Plus continues the legacy of the unique and 'fun' design language of the brand.\n\nAs for the display, like the Nothing Phone (2a), the (2a) Plus features a 6.7-inch flexible AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. Nothing provides 1300 nits of peak brightness for the (2a) Plus.\n\nSo far, the display's colours are bright and vivid. However, I'll provide more details in my full review. In the audio department, this phone boasts a dual stereo speakers, which is good.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G chipset, which is currently exclusive to this model. Other brands might adopt this chipset in the near future. The processor uses a 4nm Gen 2 TSMC process and includes an ARM Mali-G610 MC4 GPU. Everyday tasks are effortless on this phone, and the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate enhances the overall experience.\n\nI haven't tested any games on this phone yet, so stay tuned for that in my full review.\n\nIn the Antutu v10 benchmark, the Phone (2a) Plus scored 780,748 points, slightly surpassing the Realme 13 Pro and significantly outperforming the Vivo V30e in this price range.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus runs on Nothing OS 2.6, based on Android 14 out of the box. The software offers a smooth and fast user experience without any bloatware, which is a big plus. If users are seeking a clean UI, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is a strong contender. The widgets on this phone have a minimalistic look, which I really like, and the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus has ChatGPT integration.\n\nIt has a 5000mAh battery like the outgoing model. The phone supports 50W fast charging, which is 5W more than the Nothing Phone (2a). However, the charging adapter is not included in the box, which is still quite disappointing.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus features a 50-megapixel Samsung GN9 main camera with an f/1.88 aperture and a 50-megapixel Samsung JN1 ultra-wide camera with an f/2.2 aperture on the back.\n\nFor selfies, this phone has a 50-megapixel Samsung JN1 front camera with an f/2.2 aperture.\n\nThe daylight shots are impressive, with consistent and well-saturated colours. I'll need to test the camera further in both daylight and low-light conditions to provide a final verdict.\n\nUnfortunately, the rear camera setup of the Nothing Phone (2a) and the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is identical. The only difference is that the Phone (2a) has a 32-megapixel selfie camera, whereas the (2a) Plus features a 50-megapixel selfie camera.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus looks fantastic, performs well in everyday tasks, and its display offers accurate colours. However, compared to the Phone (2a), there's hardly any difference, keeping in mind that the brand hasn't launched the (2a) Plus as an upgrade to the (2a).\n\nSo, does the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus really provide the 'Plus' points at a slightly higher price?

The company is already gearing up with its Plus model for July 31. While Nothing teased about the device a while ago, it has been slowly putting out specs that the upcoming phone is shipping with.\n\nIn its latest tease on X, Nothing confirmed that the Phone 2a Plus will be shipping with three 50MP cameras -- a 50MP front sensor and two rear cameras with 50MP each. This is quite a significant upgrade over the regular Phone 2a, which features a 32MP selfie shooter. Going by the teaser, the Plus model will likely borrow some design elements from the standard model, including the camera visor and possibly the minimal glyph interface.\n\nAside from the cameras, the other confirmed specs of the Phone 2a Plus comprise up to 12GB of RAM next to an additional 8GB of RAM, aka RAM booster. Underneath, the device will be powered by MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro, which promises clock speeds of up to 3GHz -- also a significant bump over Phone 2a, which came with a Dimensity 7200. Nothing says users can experience nearly 10% performance gains over the standard model. The chipset is further packed in Mali G610 MC4 GPU for gaming.\n\nWhile true Nothing enthusiasts await the Phone 3, the company appears to be diversifying its product portfolio with new phone launches. First, it was Phone 2a, followed by its sub-brand CMF's Phone 1 launch. The latter and the former turned out to be decent options for their respective segments.\n\nThe latest CMF Phone 1 falls under $199 in the U.S., turned out to be a different phone altogether as it shipped with removable screws, which further opened possibilities like interchangeable backs and a host of new accessories that we haven't seen on any Android phones in recent times. It also shipped with Dimensity 7300, which turned out to be a speedy processor, according to our Senior Content Producer Nicholas Sutrich in his time with the CMF Phone 1.\n\nWe expect the upcoming Phone 2a Plus to be another nifty addition to the already good Phone 2a, which set a new standard for budget Android phones but has yet to be available in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "androidcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishnu_sarangapurkar@androidcentral.com", "name": "Vishnu Sarangapurkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_4_receptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melanocortin 4 receptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Vision", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Vision", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DSqd8x4VoamES6ZwXbMp9Y-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 206, "textEnd": 213}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

When Digital Trend's Andy Boxall reviewed it, he recommended it highly, saying, \"The Nothing Phone 2a's low price, fun design, colorful photos, strong performance, and masses of customization make it a brilliant buy.\"\n\nAll this may have given you high hopes for something really unique with Nothing's newest smartphone, the Northing 2a Plus. Unfortunately, the company has just teased the device, and it looks virtually identical to the Nothing Phone 2a -- down to the transparent back that shows the wireless charging coils and the distinctive Glyph Lights that give you customizable LEDs.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe color option here is a sleek and shiny silver; Nothing calls it \"silver surfer,\" which seems like a fitting comparison. Overall, it's not a bad-looking phone; it's just not very distinctive in appearance, and it'll be easy to confuse the Nothing Phone 2a and Nothing Phone 2a Plus if you see them in the wild.\n\nOn the plus side, there are significant spec changes that will be a step up from the Nothing Phone 2a. According to Nothing, the Plus model will have the new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro processor with 8 cores that can clock to 3.0Ghz. In theory, that should make the Nothing Phone 2a Plus 10% faster than the Nothing Phone 2a and 30% faster for gaming/graphics with the Mali-G610MC4 GPU.\n\nIt appears we're also looking at 12GB RAM with an 8GB RAM booster, which turns some of your storage into memory for more intensive tasks, though this seems like something of a gimmick, with many users of the Nothing Phone 2a recommending that you turn the feature off.\n\nCameras are also getting a bump up, with an upgraded 50-megapixel selfie camera replacing the 32MP front sensor on the Nothing Phone 2a. You can expect similar camera performance as the Phone 2a since it seems like neither of the dual 50MP rear sensors has gotten an upgrade, which isn't a bad thing since the Nothing Phone 2a took solid, colorful photos and was enjoyable to use.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus is expected to be officially launched on July 31, so we'll soon have all the details about the phone, including its availability and pricing.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajay_kumar@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Ajay Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Boxall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Boxall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GTufW8nXQAAX3sN.jpeg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 2178, "textEnd": 2185}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

With the introduction of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus, it's yet another testament to the company's philosophy of delivering affordably priced phones with stunning designs.\n\nComing off the launch of the Nothing Phone 2a this past spring, we're getting a slightly beefed up version with the Nothing Phone 2a Plus. Normally whenever I hear about a 'Plus' model, my first inclination is that it would be a much bigger phone -- but that's not the case here, as it sports the same 6.7-inch AMOLED.\n\nHowever, it does get a boost in nearly every other aspect to make it a better phone on paper. I think it's a bit odd to get a 6-month refresh on an existing phone, but it does beg the question if it's necessary at this point. In my Nothing Phone 2a Plus hands-on review, I'll point out its standout differences and whether it could make me forget about the Pixel 8a.\n\nThankfully there's not as big of a price hike for the Nothing Phone 2a Plus, which at $399 is only $50 more than the standard model. At the same time, its upgraded specs do nicely to justify its slightly higher cost -- which undercuts the Pixel 8a by a wide margin. You only have two color options though: grey and black.\n\nEven though it's an unlocked model, band support among wireless carriers is limited. For example, it doesn't support AT&T and Verizon's 5G network -- so you're stuck on 4G and 3G connections instead. Your best bet would be to use it with T-Mobile, but it still technically does not support all 5G bands.\n\nUnlike before, getting your hands on the Nothing Phone 2a Plus will be easier because of its broader availability to consumers. This means you don't need to be a developer to buy one. Instead, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus in grey will be available in the US through its US Beta Program starting on August 7 at 9:00 am ET -- but those in the U.K. could pick it up earlier on August 3 at the Nothing Store Soho in London.\n\nAt first glance, it looks exactly like the Nothing Phone 2a -- complete with that translucent design that lets you see the inside of the phone. It also has the same exact set of LED strip lights that make up its Glymph Interface on the back of the phone.\n\nThe only major difference with the Nothing Phone 2a Plus' design are the two new color options for it. I really like the lighter color tones and accents of the grey version I'm testing, which has better contrast than black version of the Nothing Phone 2a I reviewed. While it's a recycled design, it's still a stunning one that's highlighted by the shimmery coil that snakes down the back of the phone.\n\nFor a sub-$400 phone, I really can't complain about the display. It's the same 6.7-inch AMOLED (1084 x 2412) with an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate. Everything looks crystal clear and sharp as before, including the wide viewing angles and color saturation that AMOLED screens are known for.\n\nNothing claims that it can achieve 1,300 nits of brightness, but considering how the Nothing Phone 2a peaked at 990 nits in our testing, I'm not overly optimistic it'll be much improved here once it's properly tested, but I don't mind proving me wrong.\n\nRegardless of the outcome after it's put through Tom's Guide's display benchmarking, I have few complaints after pulling up a few videos on YouTube. Not only does its adaptive 120Hz refresh rate make them look fluid, but the iridescence and poppy colors make for a satisfying experience.\n\nFor a budget phone, the dual camera system on the back of the phone matches what I'd find in other phones in this price range -- so I'm at least happy about that. However, I was expecting upgraded camera hardware to give it a leg up over its sibling. It turns out that the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is rocking the same 50MP main and 50MP ultrawide cameras as before.\n\nIn my Nothing Phone 2a review, I praised the main camera for its excellent details and dynamic range performance. I suspect it'll be no different with the Nothing Phone 2a Plus -- but I really hope that the algorithms in Nothing's TrueLens Engine can help it out in the low light department. That's because in my Pixel 8a vs. Nothing Phone 2a photo shootout, it couldn't match the brightening abilities of the Pixel 8a in pitch black conditions.\n\nThe only hardware upgrade for the Nothing Phone 2a Plus pertains to its beefier 50MP selfie camera, which is up from the 32MP front-facing camera in the standard Nothing Phone 2a. This pixel crunching selfie camera has a lot to prove, so I'm eager to see if the upgrade makes a difference against the Pixel 8a.\n\nEven though it's able to run most games, I didn't get the smoothest frame rates with the Nothing Phone 2a because of its underwhelming processing performance. That's probably why Nothing's giving its Plus model a boost by switching to a MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G chip, which the company claims to be 10% faster than the Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro in the standard 2a model.\n\nJust as before, navigating around with the interface is accompanied by fluid animations and instant responses that scream performance. But then again, these actions don't take a lot of muscle power -- so the real test would be to find out how its graphic processing performance compares. Not only does it get a better piece of silicon under the hood, but the Phone 2a Plus also gets a boost to 12GB of RAM, which could make the budget phone run faster by recalling apps stored in its memory with RAM Booster once its native RAM is filled up.\n\nWith the new chipset, it could help to extend the Nothing Phone 2a Plus' battery life -- especially when it's packing the same 5,000 mAh battery as before. Considering how the Nothing Phone 2a managed to outlast the Pixel 8a in Tom's Guide's battery benchmark test with a time of 15 hours, I'm confident that the Plus will undoubtedly go for longer. The only other challenger for the Plus would be the OnePlus 12R, which reached an astounding 18+ hours.\n\nThe last major hardware upgrade for the Plus is that it gets a slightly faster 50W wired charging speed, which is up from the 45W charging speed of the standard Phone 2a. I suppose this wickedly fast speed is consolation for it still lacking wireless charging.\n\nAside from its unique design, the other distinctive quality about the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is its software. Nothing OS 2.6 still has that eye-catching dot matrix design language that covers everything from the icons of the apps to the font. On top of that, the Phone 2a Plus adds new Nothing widgets that include the on-the-go reminder Date widget -- as well as the Community Headlines widget, which is a hub of sorts for Nothing Community members.\n\nThey're minor additions in my opinion, but the customizable Glyph Interface still gives it that extra layer of functionality to tie the light patterns to specific notifications. The dazzling light pattern certainly draws attention, but it has purpose as well. The only downside to the software is that it still gets 3 years of software updates and 4 years security updates, which is nowhere close to the 7 years you get with the Pixel 8a.\n\nAnd lastly, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus offers ChatGPT integration directly from the homescreen with the help of a widget. While this AI-backed service can streamline searches and queries, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus doesn't come with other native AI features that are found in other, more expensive phones -- like the laundry list of AI features found in many Samsung and Pixel phones.\n\nI'm still puzzled by the phone's roll out, especially given the short time frame between it and the standard model. At the same time, though, I can't help and wonder if all the upgrades and changes to the Plus make it a worthier option at $50 more than the regular Nothing Phone 2a.\n\nAs I've pointed out all the differences, they could in total justify the Nothing Phone 2a Plus' value in supplanting the Pixel 8a in our best cheap phones list. Flying under that $400 price point, it seems like worth a consideration if you're willing to settle with 5G support with T-Mobile.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_velasco@tomsguide.com", "name": "John Velasco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-facing_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front-facing camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_wide_angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultra wide angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorfulness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency and translucency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6GcJJytwwBopy6bmEE9bAR-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1918, "textEnd": 1926}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1994, "textEnd": 2002}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The phone sports a FHD+ 6.7\" AMOLED display with 1300 nits peak brightness, and a 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate. The device maintains a screen-to-body ratio with thin 2.1 mm bezels and integrates Nothing's iconic Glyph Interface on the back.\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nEquipped with a 5,000 mAh battery, the Phone (2a) Plus supports rapid 50W Fast Charging, capable of providing a full day's power in under 20 minutes which is nearly 10% faster than its predecessor. The device can sustain up to two days of use on a single charge and retains over 90% capacity even after 1,000 charging cycles, claims company.\n\nSoftware features\n\nNothing has used recycled materials such as aluminum, tin, copper foil, and plastic in the making of the phone. The device comes with Android 14 out of the box and offers three years of software updates and four years of security updates. New features in Nothing OS 2.6 include functional widgets and the News Reporter Widget, which provides AI-curated daily news summaries.\n\nAvailability and pricing\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus will be available in two models: the 8GB RAM with 256GB storage variant priced at Rs 27,999, and the 12GB RAM with 256GB storage model priced at Rs 29,999.

It has now revealed the design of the device. People are always excited about Nothing phones because the brand is usually up to something and comes with interesting devices. However, the new Nothing Phone 2a Plus isn't expected to come with a unique design because it is the improved version of the original Phone 2a model, which Nothing has also confirmed.\n\nThe image shared by Nothing reveals that the Phone 2a Plus has the same design as the original Phone 2a model. The new one comes in a grey colour, which looks shiny and attractive in the image. It continues to feature a boxy design with three LED lights at the back, positioned around the rear camera module. It basically has a metallic appearance. It is currently unknown whether it features a plastic or glass back panel.\n\nIt is not surprising to see the same design because this is a Plus model. The company's next big update in the smartphone category will likely be the Nothing Phone 3, which is expected to get a big design change because both the Nothing Phone 2 and Phone 1 offered the same design. Later, the company introduced the Nothing Phone 2a with a slightly different design but it resembled the original generations of Nothing phones.\n\nWe witnessed the big design change with the CMF Phone 1, which many people loved because of its clean back panel look in matt finish with unique elements such as a wheel, removable screws and more. The Plus model is just a more powerful version of the Phone 2a, which Nothing is planning to launch to give people more options at different price points with better performance.\n\nWhile the new Nothing Phone 2a Plus doesn't offer a new design in comparison to the original Phone 2a smartphone, the grey colour model looks refreshing and does offer a design different from others in the market. Nothing has successfully established itself in the market with its phones, featuring designs that make them immediately recognisable as a Nothing Phone.

This is how a relatively new brand like Nothing has managed to become such a popular name here. The Nothing Phone (2a) brought a unique new design with capable hardware at an affordable price point, and the new Nothing Phone (2a) Plus looks to take it up a notch. As the name suggests, this device is an upgrade over the Nothing Phone (2a) by enhancing its performance and camera capabilities. Let's take a quick look at what the new smartphone has to offer.\n\nAt the heart of all of the improvements on the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is the new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro SoC that supports 5G connectivity. This octa-core chipset packs six Cortex-A510 cores and two Cortex-A715 cores with a max clock speed of 3.0GHz. This upgrade in the processor can be seen in the performance on offer. The new Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is said to offer a 10% increase in CPU performance, while the GPU is touted as offering a 30% improvement over the Nothing Phone (2a). This means that the phone should offer an improved experience in multitasking and gaming. A win-win for all.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus also improves upon the camera capabilities of the previous version of the smartphone. The new device packs a massive 50MP front camera, which should greatly enhance your selfies and video call quality. In fact, this front camera is now capable of shooting 4K videos at 30fps. This also means that the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus now features 50MP sensors on the front and rear of the smartphone.\n\nIn terms of battery, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus also packs a 5000mAh battery with support for 50W fast charging like the standard Nothing Phone (2a). Buyers of the new phone can expect a 10% increase in charging speed vs Phone (2a). So users can enjoy an entire day of power with a quick 20 minute charge. This efficiency is made possible thanks to the 4nm architecture that promises improved battery life and greater performance.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus also makes full use of the MediaTek NPU 657 AI accelerator found in the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 SoC. The device comes with ChatGPT integrated into Nothing OS, so direct access is just a tap away. The presence of an NPU leaves a lot of room for Nothing to implement even more AI services into the phone via a future update.\n\nWith all the other features of the new phone, Nothing has stuck to the principle of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. So you still get that immersive 6.7-inch Flexible AMOLED FHD+ panel with a 120Hz max refresh rate. Further, you also get the iconic Glyph Interface with its customisable light and sound patterns.\n\nOf course, you still get the unique design that Nothing is known for. The new phone inherits the same design story as the Nothing (2a). This includes the anthropomorphic appearance wherein the cameras within the NFC coil look like eyes, whilst being surround by a sort of brain. This design highlights the merger of technology and craftsmanship that Nothing smartphones are known for.\n\nTo help buyers stand out, Nothing offers the Phone (2a) Plus in two new colour variants, namely a Metallic Grey and a Metallic Black. This colour finish oozes quality while highlighting the improvements that the phone has to offer.\n\nAs one can see, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is an excellent symbol of the brand's desire to constantly innovate. The switch to the new and improved MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro processor showcases the brand's desire to constantly push boundaries and offer its customers the best it has to offer!", "source": {"uri": "91mobiles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "91mobiles.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A715", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ARM Cortex-A715"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A510", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ARM Cortex-A510"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mtk-nothing-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

While we have been getting information about the upcoming phone now and then, the latest official image gives a closer look at the device and reveals many details about its hardware and upcoming upgrades.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is to launch tomorrow, and before the big reveal, the company decided to keep no surprises and mystery to the phone's design and shared an image on X that showcases the back of the phone. Looking at the image, you will notice the Glyph Interface design at the top of the back panel that was sported by Nothing Phone (2a), as well as the dual rear camera setup. While the picture shows the device with a silver tone, we expect more color shades to be revealed at the launch.\n\nNothing did not only share the back panel image revealing the design and confirming the ongoing speculations but also confirmed a few days ago the specification about the camera. Nothing Phone (2a) Plus would feature a triple 50MP camera setup, with a 50MP front camera and dual cameras of 50MP+50MP on the back panel. While this is similar to the Phone (2a), the key upgrade would be a selfie camera moving to a 50MP camera setup compared to the 32MP front camera.\n\nThe camera upgrade is not the only key feature of the upcoming phone, as it would be the first device to be powered by MediaTek's new Dimensity 7350 Pro chip, which is meant to boost performance by 10 percent and bring better graphics and visuals compared to the Phone (2a)'s Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus will feature a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display and a 5,000 mAh battery. Its peak brightness of 1300 nits will improve the phone's screen visibility in bright settings or outdoors. The phone will sport a 120Hz refresh rate and have Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top of the screen for added protection and durability against scratches.\n\nThe upcoming device will have two variants: 8GB RAM + 256GB storage and 12GB RAM + 256GB storage.

This new addition follows the release of the Nothing Phone 2a earlier in March and promises to bring several enhancements. While the exact price will be revealed post-launch, it's speculated to fall under the Rs 30,000 mark, making it an appealing option for budget-conscious consumers looking for premium features.\n\nThe launch event is scheduled for 2:30 PM IST on July 31. Interested viewers can catch the live unveiling on Nothing's official YouTube channel and the Nothing events page, where the company will reveal all the details about this new device.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus maintains the distinctive design language that the brand has become known for. The teaser images suggest the device will feature a stylish grey colour with a shiny finish, continuing the boxy design aesthetic. It includes three LED lights arranged around the rear camera module, contributing to a metallic look. However, it remains unclear whether the back panel is made of plastic or glass.\n\nThe \"Plus\" in the model name indicates a more powerful version of the original Phone 2a, aimed at providing consumers with better performance and more options at different price points. Under the hood, the Phone 2a Plus is expected to be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 SoC, a notable upgrade over its predecessor. Additionally, the front camera has been enhanced to a 50-megapixel shooter, while the rear camera setup remains unchanged. The device is rumoured to pack a substantial 5,000mAh battery with support for 50W fast charging, ensuring it can keep up with the demands of modern smartphone users.\n\nAs for pricing, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is expected to be slightly more expensive than the Phone 2a, reflecting its advanced features and specifications. However, it is anticipated to remain within the sub-Rs 30,000 range, offering good value for those seeking a high-performance device at a reasonable price.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and detailed specifications as Nothing unveils the Phone 2a Plus later today. The launch will provide a complete picture of what this new smartphone offers, including any additional features or surprises that Nothing may have in store for its fans.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modular design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Video", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Video", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/07/31/1466839-nothing-phone-2a-plus.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 602, "textEnd": 609}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The camera lenses were centred on the rear so they looked like a pair of eyes.\n\nSince then, the Carl Pei co-founded company has released a Phone (2a) Special Edition, which was a remodelled handset that added splashes of red, yellow and blue for a unique look. Phone (2a) Special Edition celebrated primary colours and their place within Nothing's brand identity. The limited edition device was the first piece of Nothing hardware on which all three colours have been used.\n\nREAD MORE: I tested seven smartphones for less than \u20ac500 - here's how they compare\n\nEven more recently, Nothing dropped its first phone wearing its budget brand CMF branding. The first CMF handset is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 5G processor together with 16GB of RAM, which is incredible for a phone at this price point. Incidentally, CMF Phone 1 costs just \u20ac239 for the 128GB/8GB model and \u20ac269 for the 256GB/8GB model.\n\nThe uniqueness of CMF Phone 1 lies in its versatility. It has interchangeable covers, so you can swap out the look of your device easily. You just remove the screws with the tools provided and breathe new life into your day. You can also unscrew the Accessory Point's cover to attach a fold-out stand, card holder or lanyard. And you can mix and match cases and accessories.\n\nNow, Nothing has announced an enhanced version on Phone 2a called, as you might expect, Phone 2a Plus. The good news is it contains some welcome upgrades to what was already a fantastic value-for-money handset. The bad news is it's not going to be on sale directly from Nothing's website until September. However, it is going on sale in the UK and the US on August 3 - so it might be worth visiting the firm's Soho store if you are in London or checking the firm's Amazon store in the coming weeks to see if you can snap one up that way if you can't wait until September.\n\nIn the meantime, here's everything you need to know about Nothing Phone 2a Plus...\n\nPhone 2a Plus new features\n\nEssentially, the new handset is an upgrade to Nothing's four-month-old Phone 2a that adds more processing power and an improved camera system.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus has the same 6.7in OLED screen as Phone 2a along with the same flashing Glyph Interface, 5,000mAh battery, and NFC for contactless payments. (CMF Phone 1 had no NFC.)\n\nThe new phone comes in two colours, black and grey. I reviewed the metallic grey model which is stunning looking and has a striking wow factor.\n\nThe biggest upgrade for the Phone 2a Plus is the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, which is currently exclusive to Nothing.\n\nThe company claims the chip is close to 10 percent faster than the processor used in Phone 2a and has a GPU that's a significant 30 percent quicker.\n\nThe benchmark tests I ran have not produced scores to get too excited about, but it's real-world use that counts and Phone 2a Plus is a great phone for browsing the web, watching videos and running apps which all load quickly. Games run well too although the phone can get a little warm if playing for sustained periods of time.\n\nAnother big Phone 2a Plus bonus concerns the front-facing camera which is now a 50MP shooter, up from 32MP. It can now shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps).\n\nThere is also an improved ultra-wide camera sensor while Nothing's new AI-enhanced software gives the overall camera experience a welcome and more polished boost. For example, the Portrait mode has been enhanced so you see greater clarity on facial features, hair and eyes. All three cameras support direct 50MP photo output and HDR photo capture too.\n\nThe beefed-up battery experience is another plus, pardon the pun. This device lasts all day and recharges fully in about an hour with support for wired charging boosted from 45W to 50W. There is no wireless charging support, incidentally.\n\nNothing OS 2.6\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Nothing handsets is the unique and fun software experience. I fell in love with the black-and-white icon pack on Nothing OS 2.0, which replaces all your app and folder icons with colour-free variants. It looks so clean and refreshingly unique from a design perspective.\n\nNothing OS 2.5 (based on Android 14) added a handy Recorder widget that enables you to quickly create voice memos on-the-go. The media player widget displays album artwork and pauses music with a single tap, while the pedometer widget has a little stickman that shows how close you are to your step count goal for the day.\n\nAn AI-powered Wallpaper Studio gives you unlimited personalised wallpaper options for your home and lock screen.\n\nPhone 2a Plus runs Nothing OS 2.6 which boasts a unique News Reporter widget that rounds up customised news into eight one-minute stories. These are read aloud in the voice of a Nothing News Reporter who is actually the company's CFO, Tim Holbrow.\n\nThe firm's new Game Mode enables you to monitor frame rates, lock brightness levels and display colours and block incoming calls and notifications.\n\nOther Phone 2a Plus features\n\nI've been impressed by the superb 6.7in AMOLED display which reaches a peak brightness output of 1300 nits. The display panel has an adaptive 30-120Hz refresh rate that aids battery efficiency.\n\nYou get WiFi6, Bluetooth 5.3 and NFC connectivity and it comes with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM.\n\nOn top of all this, you get the company's iconic Glyph Interface that encourages people to put their screens down and uses light and sound patterns to indicate notifications or other information.\n\nOne of the compromises Nothing made to deliver a phone at this price include the Glyph being pared down to a few LED strips around the camera. But it's just as much fun as Phone 1 and Phone 2.\n\nNothing says it manufactured the phone with a lower carbon footprint than its other smartphones and it used 100 percent recycled aluminium in the frame. More than 50 percent of the plastic parts used were sustainably sourced.\n\nThe display is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 and a screen protector is pre-installed. The phone is IP654 rated for dust and water resistance.\n\nNothing promises three years of Android updates and four years of security patches. This is superior to many phones in this price range.\n\nPhone 2a Plus verdict\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus delivers a pleasing experience in areas such as design, display, battery life and especially the software experience. It's by far the best proposition on the table for anyone looking for a phone that costs less than \u20ac500. I suspect it will retail for between \u20ac429 and \u20ac449 but we won't know this for certain until September. You can sign up on the Nothing website to become the first to learn about Irish pricing and availability.\n\nPricing and availability\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus will be on sale first at the company's Soho store in London starting at 11AM BST on August 3 for \u00a3399 sterling. Availability in the US begins on August 7 at 9AM ET, but only through Nothing's US beta program.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus will not be on sale in Ireland on the company's website until September and pricing has yet to be confirmed.\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to get the latest news direct to your inbox\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The brand has just four smartphones in its kitty so far, counting one from it sub-brand CMF Phone 1 (review). The Phone (2a) Plus offers the same glyph interface as the previously launched Nothing Phone (2a) (review). Notable improvements include the new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro SoC, an upgraded 50MP front camera, and 50W fast charging capabilities.\n\nDo these changes make the Nothing Phone 2a Plus stand out in a segment crowded with options? Keep reading to discover.\n\nNothing hasn't tweaked the design and display of the new Phone (2a) Plus at all. The handset looks and feels the same as its younger sibling Phone (2a), with flat edges and transparent plastic back. The transparent back reveals the Glyph Interface, which, while not as dynamic as the flagship Nothing Phone 2, effectively lights up for notifications, calls, visual countdowns, and progress indicators. The white LEDs are positioned around the dual rear camera setup. To read more about the phone's Glyph Interface capabilities, we recommend checking our Nothing Phone (2a) review.\n\nThat said, the company has introduced the Phone 2a Plus in a new grey colour variant that looks quite elegant in person. Additionally, the shiny NFC coil around the camera module and other decorative coils along the bottom half of the back panel enhance its overall appeal. However, I wish the smartphone was sturdier and more durable than its previous iteration. The Phone 2a Plus is only IP54 splash-resistant, meaning it can't be exposed to significant water or rain. Furthermore, its plastic back might not resist scratches if you plan to use it without a case.\n\nThe Nothing smartphone features an in-display fingerprint scanner, which takes a fraction of a second to unlock the device. As for I/O, the phone boasts a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer on the bottom edge and stereo speakers that get plenty loud.\n\nComing to the viewing aspect, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution, Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 1,300 nits peak brightness, and up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. The display provides excellent viewing angles with dynamic colours and deep blacks. The display content is legible both indoors and outdoors, but its readability under direct sunlight is not the best. There are phones within the segment which offer higher peak brightness.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus allows users to tweak the display's colour profile and enable HDR video for an enhanced viewing experience. While the display may not support DCI-P3, it is still quite captivating.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is the world's first with MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro SoC ticking at its core. It is a slight upgrade from MediaTek's Dimensity 7200 Ultra SoC - both synthetically and in real-world performance. The handset achieves 7,71,491 on AnTuTu, which is roughly 70,000 more than the Phone (2a), whereas on Geekbench, it scores 1,121 in single-core and 2,203 in multi-core tests.\n\nWhile these may not be the benchmark numbers within the segment, POCO F6 still holds that crown, which is sufficient to provide stutter-free performance for everyday use. During our testing, the Nothing phone performed seamlessly while navigating, scrolling, browsing, and streaming. Additionally, during our test lab where we gamed BGMI, Call of Duty, and Real Racing 3 for 30 minutes each, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus thermals throttled up to 11.8 degrees on aggregate. Having said that, the average frame rate for BGMI at Smooth Graphics dropped from 90 to 37.72.\n\nOn the software front, the Nothing Phone (2a) runs Android 14-based Nothing OS 2.6 out of the box. The handset is expected to receive three years of major OS upgrades and 4 years of security updates, which will keep it relevant at least until 2028. The Nothing OS offers a clean and minimalistic software experience, along with an optional monochromatic theme that makes the UI black and white. Additionally, the phone comes with just one third-party app pre-installed while the remaining 25 are from Nothing and Google. The number of pre-installed apps is substantially less than most mid-rangers within the segment.\n\nApart from this, the software is packed with features such as widgets, an AI Wallpaper Generator, a Glyph Composer, and a ChatGPT-integrated News Reporter. This last feature is a widget that curates news from a trusted third-party source across eight different genres. The news is then summarised and converted into one-minute audio files using AI for easy listening.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus offers battery performance comparable to the regular Phone 2a. Its unchanged 5,000mAh battery allows the Plus model to achieve 14 hours and 34 minutes on the PCMark battery test, which runs a series of sequences and programs until the battery drops to 20 percent. In our YouTube video streaming test, with the screen brightness and volume set to 50 percent, the handset consumed just 4 percent of its battery after half an hour.\n\nAs for gaming, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus consumed 19 percent of battery on average after playing BGMI, Call of Duty, and Real Racing 3 for 30 minutes each. This suggests the handset is capable of lasting at least a day with moderate to heavy usage. The phone supports an upgraded 50W fast wired charging solution, achieving a full charge from 20 percent to 100 percent in 51 minutes with a compatible PD charger. Note that a charger is not included in the box and needs to be purchased separately.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is priced in India starting at Rs 27,999, which is roughly Rs 4,000 more than the Phone (2a). For the additional cost, you get improved performance, better selfies, and faster charging speeds. Everything else remains practically the same.", "source": {"uri": "91mobiles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "91mobiles.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glyph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modular programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-dynamic-range_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-dynamic-range television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POCO_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "POCO (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_scanner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint scanner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DCI-P3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnTuTu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AnTuTu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereophonic sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nothing-Phone-2a-Plus-review.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Just a day ahead of the official debut, Nothing has given us our first look at the upcoming smartphone through a teaser image. The official image offers a full view of the back and suggests a dual-tone finish for the phone. It has a dual rear camera system as well. Earlier this week, Nothing confirmed that the Phone 2a Plus will come with two 50-megapixel rear cameras and a 50-megapixel front camera. Additionally, alleged images of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus and its retail box have surfaced online.\n\nNothing on Tuesday shared the design of its upcoming Nothing Phone 2a Plus on X. As mentioned, the handset seems to have a silver and grey dual-tone design with two horizontally arranged rear cameras. The image shows a similar design to Nothing Phone 2a which was launched in May this year. The new phone appears to retain the Glyph Interface with LED lights and textured outline.\n\nAdditionally, SmartPrix has shared alleged images of the Nothing Phone 2a Plus and its retail box. The retail package has a boxy design and it looks very similar to the Nothing Phone 2a except the \"Plus\" text.\n\nNothing previously confirmed that the Phone 2a Plus would pack the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset. It is teased to include two 50-megapixel rear cameras at the back and a 50-megapixel selfie camera. It will carry 12GB of RAM and the onboard memory can be virtually expanded up to 20GB with RAM Booster technology. It will pack Mali-G610 MC4 GPU.\n\nAs per past leaks, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus will be offered in black and grey colour options. It is likely to get a 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen and an in-display fingerprint sensor.

The new Plus model has no design change but it comes with a few pluses. The major highlight of the Phone 2a Plus is a new chipset, slightly faster charging, and an upgraded selfie camera. Let's see the price and full specifications of the phone.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus is priced at Rs 27,999 for the 8GB RAM + 256GB variant and Rs 29,999 for the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant. There's no 128GB base option like the regular Phone 2a. As for offers, buyers get a Rs 2,000 discount on all credit and debit card non-EMI and EMI transactions.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus comes in two colour options - Black and Metallic Grey. The device competes with the OnePlus Nord 4, OnePlus GT 6T, Motorola Edge 50 Pro, and others.\n\nNothing Phone 2a Plus comes in two new colours that make the device look slightly different than the Phone 2a. The Metallic Grey colour, especially, gives the device a dual-tone look. The smartphone features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with an FHD+ resolution. The punch-hole panel supports 1.07 billion colours and has a 120Hz refresh rate. It has 2.1mm symmetrical bezels on all four sides and boasts 1300 nits of peak brightness.\n\nThe smartphone has a gets a new selfie camera. It flaunts a new 50MP front camera over the 32MP selfie snapper on the Phone 2a. There's a dual-rear camera system with a 50MP lens and a 50MP ultrawide lens. Both the front and rear cameras are capable of shooting 4K videos. There's Optical Image Stabilization for the main camera on the back.\n\nUnder the hood, there's a new 4nm MediaTek Dimensity 7350 chipset paired with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The device packs a 5,000mAh battery with 50W fast charging support, up from 45W fast charging. The device is advertised to offer up to two days of battery life with moderate usage.

It means there are just three lights at the top of the back of the phone, rather than the more extensive Phone (2) version.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus features the same 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 2.4K (2412\u00d71084) resolution as the Phone (2a), offering stunning colour accuracy and vivid visuals. The 120Hz refresh rate also ensures smooth and responsive navigation, adapting between 30Hz and 120Hz to conserve battery life.\n\nThe screen is flat with a slim, symmetrical bezel, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. The phone also has an IP54 rating against dust and water.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, the Phone (2a) Plus boasts a MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, designed exclusively for Nothing.\n\nWith cutting-edge TSMC 4nm Gen 2 technology and eight cores running up to 3.0 GHz, this phone should deliver strong performance, including when multitasking or gaming. The ARM Mali-G610 MC4 graphics unit should also help with graphic-intensive apps.\n\nThis is a step up from the Phone (2a), which uses a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro. It was a solid performer in our full review but likely not as powerful as the 7350 Pro in the Plus model.\n\nBoth phones offer up to 12GB of RAM, though the Plus has the capacity for an additional 8GB of virtual memory. That could be a significant advantage for power users.\n\nThe (2a) Plus has the same 50Mp main and 50Mp ultrawide rear lenses, but the selfie camera on the front has been upgraded to 50Mp from 32Mp. However, we know by now that a higher megapixel count doesn't automatically equal better photos.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus also brings a new AI Vivid Mode that enhances photos with vibrant colours and higher contrast, while Ultra XDR technology, co-developed with Google, aims for more true-to-life lighting.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus features a 5000mAh battery and 50W wired charging that, according to Nothing, offers \"day of power in under 20 minutes\", though it's not clear what rough percentage it's referring to.\n\nThe Phone (2a) also has a 5000mAh battery but supports slightly slower 45W charging. In our testing of this phone, it performed well in terms of battery life, but there's still no charger in the box or wireless charging support.\n\nRunning on Nothing OS 2.6 and powered by Android 14, the Phone (2a) Plus aims to deliver a smooth, distraction-free user experience. It features the latest Game Mode improvements that block notifications and enhance frame rates for a more immersive experience.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus will cost \u00a3399 via the Nothing website. After a limited release on 3 August, full availability and international pricing will be revealed in September.\n\nThat's \u00a380 more expensive than the regular Phone (2a) was at launch, and there aren't that many differences between the two. Unless you need more performance or a better selfie camera, you might be just as happy with the cheaper phone.\n\nSee how they compare to more alternatives in our guide to the best mid-range phones.", "source": {"uri": "techadvisor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Advisor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "artur_tomala@techadvisor.com", "name": "Artur Tomala", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phone_(Dutch_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Phone (Dutch TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_4_receptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melanocortin 4 receptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer multitasking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_wide_angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultra wide angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.techadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nothing-phone-2a-plus-review-16-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 3256, "textEnd": 3264}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It's an overclocked version of the Dimensity 7200 Pro from the Phone (2a) built in collaboration with MediaTek exclusively for the Phone (2a) Plus.\n\nThe new chip features an eight-core CPU with 2x Cortex-A715 cores clocked at 3.0 GHz alongside 6x Cortex-A510 units @ 2.0 GHz. The GPU uses the same Mali-G610 MC4 unit but is now running at 1.3 GHz. Nothing says you can expect a 10% faster CPU performance and a 30% bump in GPU-intensive tasks.\n\nMoving on to the second major change - Phone (2a) Plus gets a new 50MP front-facing camera which replaces the 32MP front-facing cam on the Phone (2a). The new imager now supports 4K video recording at up to 30fps. It's still located inside the punch-hole cutout on the 6.7-inch AMOLED screen (FHD+ 120Hz). The back houses the same 50MP main cam (24mm) and 50MP ultrawide lens.\n\nPhone (2a) Plus is also equipped with a 5,000 mAh battery with 50W wired charging support, a slight upgrade over the 45W on the Phone (2a).\n\nThe software side is covered by Nothing OS 2.6 based on Android 14 with ChatGPT integration and a new News Reporter Widget which reads news aloud using Nothing CFO Tim Holbrow's voice. That feature is also available to other Nothing phones via the Nothing Widgets app from the Google Play Store.\n\nNothing Phone (2a) Plus starts at $399/\u00a3399 for the 12GB RAM and 256GB storage trim. Pre-orders start today from nothing.tech.\n\nThe Nothing Store in Soho, London will offer the Phone (2a) Plus from 11AM BST on August 3. Buyers in the US can get their hands on the device from August 7 at 9AM ET via Nothing's US Beta Program.", "source": {"uri": "gsmarena.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GSM Arena"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overclocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A510", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM Cortex-A510"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-facing_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front-facing camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_4_receptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melanocortin 4 receptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ampere hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_wide_angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultra wide angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/24/07/nothing-phone-2a-plus-ofic/-728x314/gsmarena_000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1783, "textEnd": 1791}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1849, "textEnd": 1857}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Going into a competitive second half of the year, Nothing today is adding another budget Android phone to its name, the Phone 2a Plus.\n\nAlso: This $350 Android phone nearly made me forget about the flagships\n\nBefore the branding misleads you: no, this isn't a \"Plus\" size option of the standard Phone 2a. The display size is still 6.7 inches, the battery capacity is still 5,000mAh, and just about every dimension of the two models is identical.\n\nInstead, the Phone 2a Plus, at $399 ($50 more than the 2a), offers better specs in subtle but meaningful areas. \"This upgraded variant features a world-exclusive processor, an improved front camera, and a new metallic design. With Phone 3 launching in 2025, Phone 2a Plus is for those who are excited about Phone 2a but are seeking even higher performance,\" said Carl Pei, CEO of Nothing, in a Wednesday press release.\n\nSpecifically, the Phone 2a Plus is powered by an \"exclusive\" MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, which is quite the mouthful and capable of hitting 3.0 GHz clock speeds. In Layman's terms, expect faster app load times, animations, and general use. Here's the spec rundown.\n\nAlso: These transparent earbuds by Nothing made my AirPods look and sound boring\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus also gets a new 50MP selfie camera (up from the Phone 2a's 32MP), allowing users to capture 4K video at 30 frames per second. This is major for content creators, vloggers, and folks who just want sharper, more accurate selfies.\n\nThe new Metallic Grey and Black finishes for the Phone 2a Plus are quite different, too. Previous Nothing phones have had matte/satin-finished components tucked beneath the back cover shell, but the new model features shimmery, aluminum-like coils that establish a presence. ZDNET's Jason Hiner says the aesthetics remind him of gaming phones, and I agree. If you're down for flashy, you won't mind the new design at all.\n\nAlso: The best cheap phones in 2024: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nLastly, there's one software tidbit that's oddly satisfying on the Phone 2a Plus: the AI-powered News Reporter widget. Voiced by Nothing's CFO Tim Holbrow, the widget aggregates daily news based on selected topics (including sports, entertainment, science, and business) and plays a summarized audio track. You can play up to eight one-minute stories per day, and there's no signing up required.\n\nClearly, Pei and Co. see high demand in the mid-range market, and I don't blame them for riding the wave while it's there. I've been testing the Phone 2a Plus for about three days -- enough time to get a sense and feel of its purpose but not for a full review -- and it's an impressive handset, even when stacked beside the $1,900 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and $999 Motorola Razr+ that are also in my pockets.\n\nThe Phone 2a Plus will be available to U.S. customers in only one variant (Grey with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage) for $399 through Nothing's U.S. Beta Program, with availability beginning on August 7. While it's unfortunate that users won't be able to purchase the handset directly from retailers (not for now, at least), if the Phone 2a Plus is anywhere near as good as promised, don't be surprised to find it on ZDNET's recommended buying lists real soon.", "source": {"uri": "zdnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZDNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_size", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Display size"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Pei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Pei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plain English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headphones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Fold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Fold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Razr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorola Razr"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones_and_Telegraphs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones and Telegraphs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/85b0c392bcadd864fde62c95c64ee3b134655578/2024/07/30/6ca35fca-f35e-4115-b64f-ed7974eeac17/dsc02098-2.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3246, "textEnd": 3254}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The latest handset by the Carl Pei-led UK brand comes with upgrades over the Nothing Phone 2a. The Nothing Phone 2a Plus runs on the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G SoC and features two 50-megapixel rear cameras and a 50-megapixel front camera. The new handset sports an AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and retains Nothing's modified Glyph Interface that was seen on the standard Phone 2a. It houses a 5,000mAh battery and has an IP54-rated build.\n\nPrice of Nothing Phone 2a Plus has been set at Rs. 29,999 for the base 8GB + 256GB RAM and storage configuration. The top-end version with 12GB RAM + 256GB storage is priced at Rs. 31,999. It is offered in Black and Grey colour options and will go on sale through Flipkart starting August 7.\n\nThe dual-SIM (nano) Nothing Phone 2a Plus runs Android 14-based Nothing OS 2.6 with the company promising three years of Android updates and four years of security patches for the new phone. It sports a 6.7-inch full-HD+ (1,080x2,412 pixels) AMOLED display with up to 120Hz refresh rate, 394ppi pixel density, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. The screen is touted to deliver 1,300 nits of peak brightness and 240Hz touch sampling rate. It is equipped with an octa-core 4nm MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G SoC paired with Mali-G610 MC4 GPU and up to 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the Nothing Phone 2a is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro SoC.\n\nIn the camera department, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus boasts a dual camera setup. There's a primary 50-megapixel Samsung GN9 1/1.57-inch sensor with f/1.88 aperture, 10x digital zoom, and optical image stabilisation (OIS) with electronic image stabilisation (EIS). The secondary 50-megapixel Samsung JN1 1/2.76-inch sensor offers a 114-degree field of view. On the front, the smartphone has a 50-megapixel Samsung JN1 selfie shooter. This is a notable shift from Nothing Phone 2a's 32-megapixel front camera.\n\nUsers get up to 256GB of inbuilt storage on the Nothing Phone 2a Plus. Connectivity options on the smartphone include 5G, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6 Direct, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, QZSS, 360-degree antenna, and USB Type-C port. Sensors onboard include an accelerometer, electronic compass, ambient light sensor, gyroscope, and proximity sensor. It sports an in-display fingerprint sensor and has a linear haptic motor. Additionally, the phone includes high-definition microphones and dual stereo speakers.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus comes with an IP54-rated dust and water-resistant build. Like Nothing's Phone 2a, and Phone 1, the new device also has a Glyph Interface. This LED-filled array can light up during calls and notifications.\n\nNothing has packed a 5,000mAh battery with 50W fast charging support and 5W reverse wired charging support on the Nothing Phone 2a Plus. The battery is claimed to deliver up to 40.6 hours of music playback time on a single charge. Further, the fast charging feature is said to fill the battery from zero to 100 percent in 56 minutes.

Well, unlike other Plus-branded phones, the 'Plus' moniker in the 2a Plus' name doesn't refer to screen size. Instead, the 2a Plus boasts a slightly more powerful chipset, slightly faster wired charging and a slightly better selfie camera than its sibling, as well as two new colors: metallic Grey and updated Black.\n\nThe repetition of 'slightly' in the above paragraph is intentional, though Nothing is confident that the world-exclusive MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G chipset in the 2a Plus will bring tangible performance improvements over the standard 2a, which uses a Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset. Specifically, Nothing says the newer chipset has a 10% faster CPU and a 30% faster GPU, which should deliver a smoother gaming experience in the 2a Plus.\n\nAlso new is a sibling-beating 50MP front camera and 50W wired charging (the 2a sports a 30MP front camera and 45W wired charging), but the rest of the phone remains unchanged. You'll get the same 6.7-inch AMOLED display, the same 50MP rear wide and ultra-wide cameras, the same 5,000 mAh battery and the same IP54 water resistance rating.\n\nThat's not a problem, by any means - we described the Nothing Phone 2a as \"a breath of fresh air in a market saturated with mundane cheap smartphones\" in our Nothing Phone 2a review - but it does put the 2a Plus in reserve for mobile gaming fans almost exclusively (unless you're desperate to benefit from its superior selfie snapper).\n\nWe say this because the 2a Plus is more expensive than the standard 2a. It costs \u00a3399 in the UK (international pricing will be revealed in September) and comes in one RAM/storage configuration: 12GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. The standard 2a costs a tad less, at $349/ \u00a3349 /AU$675 for the same RAM/storage configuration, though a cheaper 8GB/128GB model is available in the UK for \u00a3319.\n\nIs that \u00a350 (and likely $50) premium for the 2a Plus worth paying for those who aren't keen mobile gamers? The jury is out on that front, though we're currently putting the new device through its paces for a full review, so we'll have a definitive verdict on this potential best cheap phones contender soon.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus will launch via a limited London store drop on August 3, at which point the phone's US Developer Programme will open, too. As mentioned, further pricing and availability will be revealed in September, so stay tuned to TechRadar for the latest.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "axel_metz@techradar.com", "name": "Axel Metz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ampere hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterproofing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterproofing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechRadar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TechRadar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2M93EJezzurnWkq4nBRhj-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 2746, "textEnd": 2754}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

See our ethics statement.\n\nA little more than four months after the Phone 2A's debut, Nothing is already introducing a follow-up with the Phone 2A Plus, which has a handful of performance improvements and a more premium look while maintaining a sub-$400 price tag.\n\nPlus is often used in smartphone naming to delineate a larger model with a bigger screen, but that's not the case here. The Phone 2A Plus has the same 6.7-inch OLED screen up front to go with the same flashing Glyph Interface in the back, the same 5,000mAh battery, and NFC, just like the 2A.\n\nThe biggest upgrade for the Phone 2A Plus is a new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, currently exclusive to Nothing, which the company claims is nearly 10 percent faster than the processor used in the Phone 2A and has a GPU that's 30 percent faster.\n\nWith the original 2A, Nothing demonstrated that a budget phone doesn't have to skimp on design, and the Plus adds two new metallic colorways: an updated black finish and a new gray option that simulates the look of unfinished machined metal.\n\nEven with those performance and style upgrades, the budget phone will sell for \u00a3399 in the UK and $399 in the US, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That's \u00a350 / $50 more than the 12GB version of the Phone 2A, and the company will continue to sell both models.\n\nThere are other improvements, too. The Phone 2A Plus' front-facing camera got a bump in resolution from 32 megapixels to 50 megapixels, and Nothing says an improved portrait algorithm helps enhance facial features like eyes and facial hair. Finally, max wired charging increased from 45W on the 2A to 50W on the 2A Plus, but there's still no wireless charging.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2A Plus will be available first at the company's Soho store in London starting at 11AM BST on August 3rd. Availability in the US will start on August 7th at 9AM ET, but only through Nothing's US beta program and, like the Phone 2A, with limited support for US networks.", "source": {"uri": "theverge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Verge"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_liszewski@theverge.com", "name": "Andrew Liszewski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vox Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-facing_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front-facing camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D_hE0hsoMbhWF7VNvuYGLajUIXE=/0x0:2500x1667/1200x628/filters:focal(1250x834:1251x835)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25552377/nothing_2a_plus1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1877, "textEnd": 1887}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1926, "textEnd": 1936}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The buzz around this new device is growing, and the company has already shared some intriguing details about what to expect.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus will run on the Dimensity 7350 Pro chip, promising strong performance and efficiency. This chip is expected to make the device quick and responsive, aiming to compete effectively in the mid-range smartphone market.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Phone (2a) Plus is its camera setup. It will come with three 50MP cameras- one on the front for selfies and two on the back for versatile photography. While we don't yet have all the technical details, the high-resolution cameras suggest that Nothing is focusing on delivering excellent image quality and flexibility for different shooting situations.\n\nNothing has given us a glimpse of the Phone (2a) Plus' rear design through a recently released image. Though the exact details are still under wraps, the design looks sleek and modern. Another image that's surfaced shows the smartphone's retail packaging, offering a peek at the branding and presentation.\n\nWith the launch event approaching, there's a lot of excitement building around the Phone (2a) Plus. We can look forward to more detailed information about the phone's full specs, features, pricing, and availability as the launch date gets closer. This will include insights into the screen size, battery life, and other key features that will influence its performance in the market.\n\nSo far, the highlights of the Phone (2a) Plus- its powerful Dimensity 7350 Pro chip and impressive 50MP camera setup- suggest that Nothing is aiming to make a strong impact in the mid-range segment. The combination of cutting-edge hardware and advanced camera technology is likely to appeal to those looking for a high-quality smartphone experience without a hefty price tag.\n\nAs we count down to the official launch, tech enthusiasts and potential buyers are eagerly awaiting more news from Nothing. With the Phone (2a) Plus just around the corner, the tech world will soon find out how it stacks up against competitors and if it lives up to the growing hype.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple To Reportedly Launch iPhone 17 Ultra In 2025; Tipped To Be World's Thinnest Smartphone", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Video", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Video", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/76769/76769_emk2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 55, "textEnd": 62, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The Phone 2a hasn't even been on shelves for six months yet, but already has a bigger brother aimed at those wanting a little more gaming oomph. This isn't a successor, though: the new Phone 2a Plus will live alongside Nothing's most popular model.\n\nYou don't need to consult the spec sheets to spot a Phone 2a Plus: it's rocking a new grey colour scheme, with see-through elements that've been given a shiny silver treatment. The overall styling stays the same, with the pared-back glyph lighting system and polycarbonate case first seen on Phone 2a. Those eye-like dual rear cameras have made a comeback, too. I'm in two minds: the silver is a lot more distinctive, but arguably a bit blingy for a firm that prides itself on minimalist design.\n\nThe biggest internal upgrade is a new MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset, which promises more power for both apps and games than the Dimensity 7200 Pro used in Phone 2a. The benchmarks (805,721 in Antutu, 1209 and 2663 in Geekbench 6) put it ahead of the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion and Samsung Galaxy A35, and see it open up much more of a gap to the bargain basement CMF by Nothing Phone 1.\n\nNothing reckons it shouldn't sap the 5000mAh battery any faster, so you can expect all-day life away from the mains. I've not had enough time with my review unit to confirm just yet.\n\nA modest boost to wired charging speeds should mean less time spent tethered, too; Phone 2a Plus can suck down volts at 50W from a compatible power brick, versus 45W in the Phone 2a. Not that either model includes an adapter in the box, mind.\n\nYou're still getting a 6.7in AMOLED with skinny, symmetrical bezels and rounded-off corners. The Full HD+ resolution, 120Hz refresh rate and 1300 nit peak brightness are a match for Phone 2a, which was very easy on the eye for an affordable phone.\n\nThe two 50MP rear snappers are unchanged, but the front-facing selfie cam has been upgraded to a matching 50MP unit, instead of the 32MP one used on Phone 2a. All three sensors come from Samsung, which should mean greater image processing consistency - something the mainstream 2a was hardly lacking. I've been snapping away for a few days, but need more time to deliver a full verdict.\n\nOn the software front, Phone 2a Plus arrives running Nothing OS 2.6; the firm's minimal, widget-based take on Android 14 is still comfortably one of my favourite mobile skins, with its monochrome UI being entirely free from bloat. A new News Reporter widget is available here for the first time, using AI to aggregate daily news from categories including business, entertainment, science, sports and tech. The one minute audio chunks are convenient, but the voice that reads them out sounds incredibly bored; it's not going to be replacing my Feedly RSS reader any time soon.\n\nAt \u00a3399 for a 12GB+256GB variant, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus is still refreshingly affordable. It undercuts the Pixel 8a and OnePlus Nord 4, while leaving enough of a hardware gap to leave the Nothing Phone 2 as the firm's flagship offering. It'll be going on sale in the UK first, with a limited drop at Nothing's London Soho store on the 3rd of August. A US developer programme will also open then, with pricing and availability for the rest of the world set to be confirmed in September.", "source": {"uri": "stuff.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stuff"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_morgan_freelander@stuff.tv", "name": "Tom Morgan-Freelander", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polycarbonate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Phone_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nothing Phone 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geekbench", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geekbench"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_Nord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus Nord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital image processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feedly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News aggregator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.stuff.tv/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Nothing-Phone-2a-Pluis-hot-stuff-lead.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 3231, "textEnd": 3244}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

But like with the CMF Phone 1, the company has decided to drip-feed info about the phone, leading up to its launch tomorrow. In a new post on the company's official account on X, previously Twitter, it has been revealed that the phone will sport three 50MP cameras.\n\nOf course, not all three of them will be sitting at the back of the Nothing Phone (w2) Plus. In the configuration that makes the most sense, two will be at the back, while one will be in front. This does mean that this phone will have a better front-facing camera than the Phone (2), at least in terms of pixel count.\n\nSeparately, the way the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus looks has also appeared online, through unofficial sources this time. As shared by Smartprix, the leaked render of the phone makes it look a lot like its base counterpart. The retail box itself looks to be mimicking the back of the phone as well.\n\nThe report also mentions some alleged specs of the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus beyond its chipset and cameras. This includes a 6.7-inch Full HD+ 120Hz screen, a 5,000mAh battery with 50W charging, and two memory and storage variants, claimed to be 8GB + 256GB and 12GB + 256GB.\n\nOn one hand, the leaked render of the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus is not too unbelievable, as it is after all a variant of the base model. The specs themselves are not too out there either, but it's better to take them both with a pinch of salt, at least until its official reveal at 5PM tomorrow.", "source": {"uri": "lowyat.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lowyat.NET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-facing_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front-facing camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.lowyat.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nothing-Phone-2a-Plus-camera-teaser.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The device features the company's signature transparent design while toning down the Glyph interface.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) is placed below the Nothing Phone (2) and is aimed at users looking for a more affordable option but wanting a similar design and UI. The device's highlights include its design, clean UI and battery life.\n\nI have been using the Nothing Phone (2a) for a few days now, and here is my detailed review of the latest mid-range smartphone from the smartphone maker.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) has been launched in three variants. The base variant, with 8GB RAM and 128GB of internal storage has been priced at \u20b923,999. The mid variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage has been priced at \u20b925,999 and the top-end variant with 12GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage has been priced at \u20b927,999.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) is available in four colour options - Black, Blue, Special Edition and White.\n\nIn the box\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nStarting with the design, Nothing has made several changes to the design of the device when compared to its predecessors, while retaining its transparent design language.\n\nThe device comes in four colour options - Black, Blue, Special Edition and White. I received the Black colour variant of the device, which is also my preferred variant.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) comes with a redesigned camera module, with the cameras placed horizontally and the LED flash placed above the camera module.\n\nThe smartphone comes with a transparent plastic back, showcasing some of the interiors of the device. While you may want to use the device without a case to flaunt the design, it is a dust and fingerprint magnet and you may be forced to slap on a case.\n\nThe company has reduced the number of lights on the Glyph interface to just three for the Nothing Phone (2a) but they look good and add a unique touch to the device. The Glyph interface lights up for notifications, calls and even to show the battery level while being charged.\n\nThe smartphone features a matte black plastic frame with the power button placed on the right side.\n\nYou get two individual volume rockers on the left side.\n\nAt the top, you get a microphone.\n\nAt the bottom, the device features a SIM tray, a microphone, a USB Type-C port and a speaker grille.\n\nComing to the display, the smartphone features a 6.7-inch Full HD+ OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 1300 nits peak brightness.\n\nThe display is quite bright and easy to read outdoors, offering good sunlight visibility. The colours are accurate and you will not face any issues, whether you are gaming, watching movies or just browsing social media.\n\nIt is equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to offer protection to the display.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) runs on Android 14 out of the box with the company's Nothing OS 2.5 on top. The device will get three years of Android updates and four years of security updates, which is fine for a mid-range smartphone.\n\nIf you have used a Nothing phone before, the software remains the same. You get a near-stock Android experience, along with improvements and added customisation options.\n\nNothing is popular for its quirky widgets and that is also the case with the Phone (2a). You get a good collection of widgets with the device and it does not come with any bloatware so you don't have to worry about having to uninstall a ton of apps.\n\nIn terms of performance, the Nothing Phone (2a) is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset coupled with up to 12GB LPDDR4X of RAM and 256GB of UFS 2.2 internal storage.\n\nThe Dimensity 7200 Pro offers good performance and battery efficiency. The chipset, which is coupled with ample RAM and storage can handle multitasking efficiently, without any stuttering.\n\nI played popular titles such as Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty: Mobile on the device and did not notice any stuttering. If you are a casual gamer, you can get the device without any worries. If you plan on using the device for extended gaming sessions, it does heat a little but is manageable.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) is powered by a 5,000mAh battery with 45W fast charging support. The device is power efficient and easily offers over a day's of battery life, with regular usage, streaming and light gaming.\n\nComing to the camera department, the Nothing Phone (2a) features a dual camera setup at the back consisting of a 50MP primary camera with OIS and a secondary 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera.\n\nThe device can capture good photos in daylight conditions, with good colour reproduction and proper saturation. The device can capture a good amount of detail.\n\nIn low light conditions, the images captured are decent but there is some noise. The colours are good and there is minimal noise.\n\nThe device can capture good portraits in daylight conditions, with proper edge detection and subject focus.\n\nWhile there is no telephoto camera offered with the phone, you can capture decent shots using the 2x zoom option.\n\nOn the front, the device features a 32MP selfie camera. The selfie camera works well and is great for capturing selfies and video calls.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) is a well-designed smartphone that stands apart in the crowd while offering decent features. The device comes with a clean UI, good software support and offers decent performance.\n\nThe device does have its share of issues such as a back that attracts fingerprints and lack of a charger in the box.\n\nOverall, the Nothing Phone (2a) is a good option worth considering in the under \u20b930,000 segment.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this website is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a purchasing guide or recommendation.

This time around, it's more than just cosmetic changes, as the phone features improvements in a few crucial areas and a new processor powering the phone. All this comes at a bumped-up price. So let's check out its specifications, and pricing in India below.\n\nTalking about the design, the Phone (2a) Plus has the same polycarbonate exterior as the Phone (2a) that came out in March. Down to the design, button placements, and the Glyph setup. So if you have bought any cases for that phone, it will fit perfectly on this one. The only thing new are the color options: Grey and Black. The metallic strip also stands out more as it has a silver chrome finish.\n\nAt front, you'll be greeted with the identical 6.7-inch Full HD+ display with a 120 Hz refresh rate and 2160 nits of peak brightness. The flat panel still retains the Gorilla Glass 5 protection.\n\nWhat's new is the processor. Nothing this time went with the latest MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro CPU. It's not a major upgrade as it only outputs a 10% boost in performance compared to the Dimensity 7200 Pro used in the Nothing Phone(2a). You can read more about it in our comparison. In short, this should help you with improvements in gaming and better stability.\n\nOther than that, you'll find the same 50 + 50 MP camera setup at the back with no new improvements. However, on the front, the 32 MP selfie shooter is ditched for a new 50 MP sensor. This should help capture better details in selfie and portrait images, and will also allow 4k at 40 FPS video recording from the front camera.\n\nWhile the battery capacity hasn't changed, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus comes with 50-watt fast charging support as opposed to 45-watt in the Phone (2a). But the charger is still missing from the box, and you'll have to purchase separately.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus will have two variants: 8 or 12 GB RAM and 256 GB storage. Yes, there is no 128 GB variant, which is a good thing because even 128 GB doesn't take that long to fill up nowadays. As I mentioned above, it will come in two color options, gray and black.\n\nAs for the price; the Phone (2a) Plus starts at Rs 27,999 for the 8+256 GB variant and Rs 29,999 for the 12+256 GB variant. The phone will get a bank discount of Rs 3,000 which will make its price effectively Rs 24,999, but it will only be available for a limited window. It will be available for sale exclusively from Flipkart.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anshuman_jain@beebom.com", "name": "Anshuman Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polycarbonate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-panel_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flat-panel display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gorilla Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flipkart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nothing-Phone-2a-Plus-vs-OnePlus-Nord-4-Design-6-1.jpg?w=1250&quality=75", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Created by Carl Pei's UK-based startup, this latest model introduces several exciting enhancements, including a more powerful processor, improved cameras, and a vibrant AMOLED display with a higher refresh rate.\n\nAt the heart of the Phone 2a Plus is the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G SoC, which represents a significant upgrade from the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro found in the previous model. This new octa-core processor, combined with the Mali-G610 MC4 GPU, promises better performance for multitasking and gaming. The phone is available in two versions: one with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage priced at Rs. 27,999, and a higher-end model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for Rs. 29,999. It will be available for purchase on Flipkart starting August 7 and comes in Black and Grey.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus features a 6.7-inch full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. This screen is capable of reaching a peak brightness of 1,300 nits and has a touch sampling rate of 240Hz, providing a sharp and fluid visual experience. It's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which helps guard against everyday wear and tear.\n\nThe camera setup on this phone has also seen significant improvements. The rear cameras now include two 50-megapixel sensors: the primary one is a Samsung GN9 with optical image stabilization (OIS) and electronic image stabilization (EIS), while the secondary is a Samsung JN1 with a wide 114-degree field of view. For selfies, the phone offers a 50-megapixel front camera, a noticeable upgrade from the 32-megapixel camera on the Phone 2a.\n\nRunning on Android 14 with Nothing OS 2.6, the Phone 2a Plus will receive three years of Android updates and four years of security patches. It offers up to 256GB of internal storage and supports a wide range of connectivity options, including 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and USB Type-C. The phone also features an in-display fingerprint sensor, high-definition microphones, dual stereo speakers, and a linear haptic motor.\n\nThe device is built to be durable with an IP54 rating, meaning it's resistant to dust and water. The signature Glyph Interface, which lights up for notifications and calls, is retained from the previous model. Additionally, the phone comes with a 5,000mAh battery that supports 50W fast charging and 5W reverse wired charging.

Despite what the name suggests, it's the same size as its predecessor, but it's the upgrades on the inside that count.\n\nNothing is officially launching the phone on July 31, but if you don't feel like waiting, the brand has already shared a teaser revealing the design as well as some key specs on its social media accounts.\n\nThe new phone looks almost identical to the Nothing (2a), aside from a slick new silver color scheme, but more exciting upgrades are found inside. If it wasn't already one of the best mid-range phones around, these new additions make it an even more viable contender.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus is confirmed to run on the MediaTek Dimensity 7350, offering performance gains over the Dimensity 7200 Pro-powered (2a) and potentially making the device a future addition to our list of the best budget gaming phones. Rumors also tell us to expect a 50MP selfie camera (up from 32MP) and 50W charging speeds, rather than 45W.\n\nWhile they're all welcome upgrades, they're all also relatively minor. It's an unusual move to release a slightly upgraded model just a few months after the original, but if you're in the market for a phone like this, you may have just received a free upgrade. We're not sure how welcome news it is for those who already have a Nothing Phone (2a) though, with some presumably wishing they'd held off a bit longer.\n\nOf course, there could be plenty of other changes that Nothing hasn't revealed yet, and we'll know for certain when the phone is unveiled tomorrow. Still, even if it lives up to the original from our solid 8/10 Nothing Phone (2a) review, there's stiff competition on the way with the upcoming release of the new iPhone 16 series and August's Made by Google event introducing the best Google Pixel phones of 2024.", "source": {"uri": "pockettactics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocket Tactics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones_and_Telegraphs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones and Telegraphs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.pockettactics.com/wp-content/sites/pockettactics/2024/07/nothing-phone-2a-plus-design.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 436, "textEnd": 443}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The brand - led by formed OnePlus man, Carl Pei - has gone from strength to strength in the market.\n\nThey've unveiled a boatload of new devices over the last few months. We've got the flagship - though still mightily affordable - Nothing Phone (2). Then, we had the Nothing Phone (2a), and below that even, the remarkable value CMF Phone 1.\n\nJust when you thought there wasn't a gap left in their market, the brand has unveiled the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus. That takes the award-winning Phone (2a) blueprint and gives it a boost. But is it any good? Let's find out.\n\nDespite many suggestions to the contrary, the new model isn't a larger variant of the Phone (2a). We're thankful for that too, as anything larger could have become positively pocket-busting.\n\nInstead, there are a suite of minor upgrades to the spec sheet which come together to offer a resolute package. That kicks off with the front-facing camera, which is boosted up to 50MP from 32MP on the original.\n\nThat's significant for the brand, making this the first ever Nothing handset to feature a triple 50MP camera array. It's also absolutely killer for selfies, with a level of detail that is more than enough for almost every user. You've been warned - this camera will spot the wrinkles you didn't know you had yet.\n\nThere's also a new processor inside. That's called the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro - and if you haven't heard of it before, that's because it's brand new. In fact, this is a world exclusive chip for this handset.\n\nThat's a very exciting prospect, though the specs are quite close to the original handset. It's an 8-core, 3Ghz processor, built on a second generation 4nm process from TSMC.\n\nUsers can expect to get 10% faster CPU speeds and 20% faster GPU speeds from the device. It also adds a couple of features only possible on this chip. That sees an auto-defrag cleaning process happen behind the scenes, while it also boosts file sharing speeds when linking up with Windows PCs.\n\nThe other big news comes in the form of its design language. The model sets itself apart from the rest of the Nothing range with a gorgeous metallic finish, which shimmers against the light.\n\nIt's a really neat touch, and looks great on the back of the handset.\n\nUltimately, the answer to that question is almost certainly yes. Priced at just \u00a3/$399, this device represents exceptional value for money, with killer specs in key areas making it a must-have for most people.\n\nIf you're already a Phone (2a) owner, the incremental nature of the upgrades probably aren't worthwhile. But for everyone else, the better front camera coupled with a hotter processor and a neat design make the extra \u00a350 a worthwhile spend - and mark this down as one of the best value for money handsets on the market today.", "source": {"uri": "t3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "T3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_cross@t3.com", "name": "Sam Cross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flagship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-facing_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front-facing camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "File sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSmaQDxbfgNNcv7hanESEY-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The plucky tech start-up has gone from strength to strength, offering quality Android phones at prices which defy belief.\n\nFrom their top spec Nothing Phone (2) to the ultra-budget CMF Phone 1, the brand has a focus on offering slick styling, great specs and pretty much unbeatable value for money.\n\nThat makes the prospect of a new handset even more appealing. Today, the brand unveiled the design of their hotly anticipated Nothing Phone (2a) Plus handset.\n\nTaking to social media, the device was shown off from the rear side. We see that it uses the same ribbon cable-esque design found on the original Nothing Phone (2a).\n\nHowever, it appears that it is made from a metallic material this time out. That's not just a fancy skin, either.\n\nAs the caption of their post suggests, the metallic design is intended as a tip of the hat to the machinery used to manufacture the device. They say, \"Reminiscent of technical machinery, the metallic finishes on Phone (2a) Plus highlight its cutting-edge upgrades. A new premium expression.\"\n\nThe latter half of that sentence is important, too. The brand has been drip feeding information about the new handset over the last few days, giving us a little idea of what could be coming.\n\nWe already know that the handset is set to enjoy a world exclusive processor called the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro. That's said to run 10% faster than the current Phone (2a) iteration in the CPU, with a 30% boost for the GPU speeds.\n\nAs if that weren't enough of a boost, we've also heard about an upgrade to the camera system. While the rear of the handset looks set to stay as a dual 50MP array, the front-facing sensor is also going to get a 50MP unit. That's a big deal, and should help to ensure that users can selfie and TikTok with exceptional quality.\n\nWith the handset due to release tomorrow (31st July 2024) we don't have long to wait before we'll know all about it.", "source": {"uri": "t3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "T3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_cross@t3.com", "name": "Sam Cross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T3_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T3 (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety_Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety Products and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sdWhhsD8XjXzUe3jTwuvM4-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The cameras are no surprise either, following the official teaser yesterday, but the launch confirms that the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus has a 50MP main + 50MP wide angle camera pair at the back, and a 50MP secondary shooter in a punch hole cutout.\n\nAs part of the unveiling though, the company only announced the price and availability of the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus in the UK and US.

The Phone 2a Plus is a modest upgrade, but still significant, being as how the original 2a was just released back in March.\n\nMost notably, the 2a Plus has a faster chip than the OG 2a. The original's Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro maxed out with a clock speed of 2.8GHz. The 2a Plus boasts a Mediatek Dimensity 7350 Pro that can hit 3.0GHz. Beyond that, the new model features a slightly quicker wired charging speed, at 50W instead of 45W.\n\nThat's about it. Every other aspect is nearly identical to the 2a. It has the same camera system, the same battery, the same display and similar aesthetics. This isn't a bad thing. We loved the Phone 2a in our official review, calling it \"a budget phone that's packed with personality.\"\n\nNow onto the bad news. This phone will technically be available to US customers via the company's beta program, though there are some caveats. American customers can only buy the gray version and not the black one. Even more important, the 2a Plus doesn't offer true 5G connectivity with many of the major US carriers. This includes both AT&T and Verizon.\n\nThe Nothing Phone 2a Plus costs $400 and that gets you 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. Nothing Beta members will be able to order the phone on August 3. UK residents can scoop it up directly from the company on the same day. Nothing says we'll have to wait until September to find out more details regarding global availability.\n\nThe company also released a few tidbits about the upcoming Nothing OS 2.6.

It promises 8.05 lakh+ AnTuTu scores.\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus has an advanced liquid cooling system that includes a large 3,200 mm\u00b2 vapour chamber for faster heat dissipation and 12,000 mm\u00b2 large cooling area, said the company.\n\nThis has a new 50MP front camera with support for 4K video recording compared to 32MP in the Phone (2a), while retaining the dual 50MP sensors for the main camera and the ultra-wide camera.\n\nIt runs Android 14-based Nothing OS 2.6 with more functional widgets for mindful interactions on the home and lock screens with swipeable views and animations. The News Reporter Widget uses AI to aggregate daily news in a simple and intuitive format and read aloud by Nothing CFO Tim Holbrow. This is available on all Nothing smartphones through the Nothing Widgets app.\n\nThe phone offers a metallic finish on the back that uses an innovative fusion of nano-coating, multi-layer printing techniques, proprietary ink formulations, and carefully chosen coating materials. A process which required intricate texturing and extensive technical analysis. An exclusive shine, perfected after over 20 manufacturing methods and numerous sampling rounds, said Nothing.\n\nIt retains LEDs for the glyph on the back with 3 separations, and 26 addressable LED lighting zones. The phone retains the huge, 5000mAh battery, but has support for 50W PD charging, compared to 45W in the Phone (2a), which promises a day's power in 20 minutes of charge.\n\nThe phone can maintain over 90% of its maximum capacity after 1,000 charging cycles, corresponding to over 3 years of daily charging, says the company.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus comes in Grey and Black colours and is price at Rs. 27,999 for the 8GB + 256GB model and the 12GB + 256GB model costs Rs. 29,999.

It has the same transparent design, Glyph interface, but comes with a faster SoC, new metallic design, new 50MP front camera and faster 50W fast charging. Here we have the unboxing and first impressions of the phone.\n\nThe Nothing phone (2a) has a 6.7-inch Full HD+ OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. Since the screen has up to 1300 nits peaks brightness, it is bright when viewing HDR content, and also good for outdoors.\n\nIt is powered by a faster MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro SoC that offers up to 3GHz clock speed, compared to 2.8GHz in the 7200, making it 10% faster, and this also has a faster Mali-G610 MC4 GPU clocked up to 1.3 GHz, which is 30% faster than the GPU in the 7200 Pro that is clocked at up to 1GHz. It has 3,200 mm\u00b2 vapour chamber for faster heat dissipation and 12,000 mm\u00b2 large cooling area.\n\nInside the tiny punch-hole there is a 50-megapixel camera with Samsung JN1 sensor and f/2.2 aperture, an upgrade from 32MP camera in the Phone (2a), and this also supports 4K video recording. The earpiece grill is on the top edge, which doubles as up as a secondary speaker. It has an in-display fingerprint scanner. There is a small chin below the display.\n\nComing to the button placements, the power button is present on the right side and the volume rockers are on the left side. The dual SIM slot, primary microphone, USB Type-C port and the loudspeaker grill are on the bottom. The secondary microphone is on the top.\n\nIt retains the 50MP main camera + 50MP ultra-wide camera from the Phone (2a).\n\nThe phone offers a metallic finish on the back that uses an innovative fusion of nano-coating, multi-layer printing techniques, proprietary ink formulations, and carefully chosen coating materials. It also comes in Black.\n\nA process which required intricate texturing and extensive technical analysis. An exclusive shine, perfected after over 20 manufacturing methods and numerous sampling rounds, said Nothing. It has IP54 ratings for dust and water resistance.\n\nThe phone retains the 5000mAh battery, but has support for 50W PD charging, compared to 45W in the Phone (2a), which promises a day's power in 20 minutes of charge.\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus starts at Rs. 27,999 for the 8GB + 256GB model and doesn't have the 128GB model. It will be available from Flipkart starting from 7th August.

The device will be available in the US as part of Nothing's \"beta program\" for $399 as well as the UK for \u00a3399.\n\nBrits will be able to get the device -- which has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage -- in either black or grey while Americans will be limited to just grey. Those in the UK will also be able to get their hands on it first at a \"limited drop\" at Nothing's London Soho store. Users in the US can place orders starting August 7 at 9 am ET before the rest of the world gets the device in September (with exact worldwide regions and pricing still to be revealed).\n\nUnlike other \"Plus\" phones, the 2A Plus will keep the same 6.7-inch display as the regular 2A that was priced at $349 when it was introduced in March. The improvements for this Plus phone will be in the rest of its specs. It sports a faster MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro 5G processor, improves the front camera to a 50-megapixel Samsung sensor (compared to the 2A's 32-megapixel Sony shooter) and has slightly faster charging speeds (50W versus 45W).\n\nNothing's \"glyph interface\" of lights remains on the rear of the device, with the company also keeping other specs like the 5,000-mAh battery that it says \"can deliver up to two days of use on a full charge and retains over 90% of its full capacity, even after 1,000 charging cycles.\"\n\nThe Phone 2A Plus runs on Android 14 with Nothing promising three years of software updates and four years of security updates.\n\nAs with its prior phones, however, Nothing users in the US should be mindful of limited 5G support. The carrier has confirmed to CNET that \"not all carriers will fully allow Phone (2a) Plus to operate on their network\" and that even the ones that do may be limited.\n\nRead more: Best Phones Under $500\n\nOn AT&T, the Phone 2A Plus is limited to just 4G LTE while Verizon compatibility will be even tighter. Not only is there no 5G support but you will need to contact Verizon prior to using your phone and have them add the IMEI for the Phone 2A Plus to its database. Even then, you'll be limited to only some of the carrier's 4G LTE bands (bands 4/5/66, with similar limitations on AT&T's 4G LTE network).\n\nNothing's new phone will have limited 5G on T-Mobile, though the one 5G band it supports is at least the carrier's N41 -- the integral piece of spectrum for its faster \"Ultra Capacity\" network (also known as \"5G UC\"). While better than the nothing you'll get in 5G support on AT&T or Verizon, the Phone 2A Plus is still missing important pieces of T-Mobile's 5G network like its low-band 5G that's crucial for coverage.\n\nThose concerned about being connected may once again need to look for something else.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cellular network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Mobile Equipment Identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/935ff97512c98b5718f25ce5f38e8fb66ef12560/hub/2024/07/29/f58deab1-df6c-40f6-a593-3a9c8784a2e0/16x9-7.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772639", "eventUri": "eng-9772639", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 676, "textEnd": 684}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Building on the success of the Phone (2a), this upgraded model amplifies three key areas: performance, camera, and design, making it a must-have for those seeking the ultimate smartphone experience.\n\nElevated Performance with MediaTek 7350 Pro 5G Processor\n\nAt the heart of the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus lies the world-exclusive MediaTek 7350 Pro 5G processor. This advanced chipset, paired with cutting-edge TSMC 4 nm Gen 2 technology, ensures a smoother and faster user experience.

This upgraded variant features a world-exclusive processor, an improved front camera, and a new metallic design. With Phone (3) launching in 2025, Phone (2a) Plus is for those who are excited about Phone (2a) but are seeking even higher performance.\"\n\nSuperstar Selfies with a 50 MP Front Camera\n\nThe Nothing Phone (2a) Plus redefines smartphone photography with its new 50 MP front camera sensor, perfect for capturing superstar selfies and high-quality video calls. The triple 50 MP camera system includes a main sensor with an f/1.88 lens, an ultra-wide sensor with a 114\u00ba field of view, and the new front camera. All three sensors support direct 50 MP photo output, HDR photo capture, and 4K video recording, ensuring every shot is vivid and detailed.\n\nSleek Metallic Design\n\nDesign-wise, the Phone (2a) Plus introduces two stunning new colors: metallic Grey and updated Black. The metallic finish offers a premium expression of Nothing's design language, reminiscent of sleek machinery. This design evolution, inherited from Phone (2a), integrates components into the phone's exterior, creating an anthropomorphic appearance with the camera and NFC coil representing eyes and a brain-like hub of intelligence.\n\nPowerful Battery and Fast Charging\n\nFor users on the go, the Phone (2a) Plus features a robust 5,000 mAh battery, offering up to two days of use on a full charge. It also supports rapid 50W Fast Charging, replenishing a day's power in under 20 minutes -- nearly 10% faster than the Phone (2a).\n\nStunning Display and Glyph Interface\n\nThe Phone (2a) Plus boasts a flexible FHD+ 6.7\" AMOLED display with precise color reproduction of 1.07 billion colors and a peak brightness of 1300 nits. The 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate ensures smooth interactions, while the 240 Hz touch sampling rate offers instant responsiveness. The iconic Glyph Interface remains, encouraging users to rely on light and sound patterns for key information, enhancing the phone's sleek metallic aesthetic.\n\nAdvanced Nothing OS and AI Integration\n\nRunning on Nothing OS 2.6, the Phone (2a) Plus expands its library with functional widgets for mindful interactions. The new News Reporter Widget, leveraging AI technology, provides a daily digest of news read aloud by Nothing CFO Tim Holbrow.

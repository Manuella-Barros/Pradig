The Sooners had to rely on a few players who weren't on the team last season.\n\nFreshmen Kasidi Pickering and Ella Parker at the plate, and senior Karlie Keeney in the circle. That trio made sure No. 2-ranked OU did not get swept in Bedlam at Love's Field, helping OU to an 8-2 victory Sunday afternoon.\n\nTied 2-2 entering the bottom of the sixth, Jayda Coleman came through with an RBI single. Then it was time for Parker. The freshman crushed her 10 home run of the season, a three-run bomb that allow Love's Field to celebrate just a little bit more.\n\nIt was Parker that sparked the six-run sixth, after Pickering picked the team up back in the fourth.\n\nScoreless through three innings, Pickering finally came up with the big hit that OU couldn't get in the first two games. An opposite field two-run home run, which was the first of the weekend.\n\nAnd then there was Keeney. She came in relief Friday and Saturday and was the only OU pitcher to not allow a run. So head coach Patty Gasso rolled the dice and had Keeney start.\n\nKeeney trusted her defense and went to work. Super efficient the entire time. Trusting that defense included a diving fielder's choice final out in the top of the fifth by Tiare Jennings.\n\nKeeney pitched five scoreless innings. Kierston Deal came in and allowed three straight singles and got one out. Gasso went back to Keeney, who gave up a two-run single but then shut the door.\n\nKeeney threw 6.2 innings, allowing four hits, four walks and striking out three. She is 5-1 this season.\n\nAfter Parker's home run, Tiare Jennings added a solo shot. Hannah Coor also had an RBI single.\n\nA win that was probably more needed for OU than OSU at this point. Texas had already clinched the outright Big 12 championship earlier in the day. The win puts OU as the No. 2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament. OSU is now the No. 3 seed.\n\nIf everything goes to plan, Round 4 of Bedlam would be Friday evening at USA Hall of Fame Stadium. But we've still got work to get done, first. And OU will have a few more days to see if it can get to that level it knows will be necessary rest of the way, like it did in the sixth.\n\nTime for the Big 12 Tournament. OU (46-6 overall, 22-5 Big 12) is not the No. 1 seed and will have to wait until Wednesday to find out its opponent. No. 7 Kansas plays No. 10 Houston in the first round Wednesday at USA Softball Hall of Fame Stadium. The Sooners will play the winner of that game 1:30 p.m. Thursday in Oklahoma City.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_przybylo@on3.com", "name": "Bob Przybylo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayda_Coleman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayda Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Gasso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Gasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlam_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bedlam Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_University\u2013Stillwater", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiare_Jennings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiare Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Softball_Hall_of_Fame_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Softball Hall of Fame Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/05171432/Rylie-Boone3-e1714947346831.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542088", "eventUri": "eng-9542088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

OU coach Patty Gasso moved quickly down the third-base line to argue the call.\n\nThe Cowgirls got two runners on in the top of the fifth, but OU shortstop Tiare Jennings ended the inning with a diving stop of a Tallen Edwards grounder, reaching to tag second base with her glove to get the force out just before Jilyen Poullard got to the bag.\n\nLexi McDonald led off the inning with her second hit of the day, a long single off the left field wall. She has two of OSU's three hits in the game. But OSU stranded two runners and remains in a 2-0 hole.\n\n-- Scott Wright, Staff writer\n\nBottom 4: OU 2, OSU 0 | Kasidi Pickering opens the scoring\n\nOU freshman Kasidi Pickering lasered a ball to left center field to open the game's scoring.\n\nPickering's two-run shot was the Sooners' first home run of the series.\n\nA leadoff walk was all the Cowgirls could manage in the top of the fourth inning, stranding pinch-runner Taylor Anderson at first base. Through four, the Cowgirls have two hits and two walks.\n\nOU had an opportunity to open the scoring with runners at the corners, two outs and Tiare Jennings up to the plate. But Jennings grounded out, keeping her weekend hitless streak alive.\n\nOSU had runners on the corners with no outs, but couldn't manage a run, keeping the game scoreless.\n\nJilyen Poullard's grounder to first base led to pinch-runner Tia Warsop being cut off at home plate, retreating to third base where she was tagged out. OSU asked for a review, hoping for an obstruction call, but the out was upheld.\n\nThen Tallen Edwards lined into a double play at second base to end the inning.\n\nOSU's Ivy Rosenberry is back in the circle for the third inning, though sophomore Kyra Aycock was throwing in the bullpen last inning.\n\nAlyssa Brito singled to left center field, firing up the Love's Field crowd but OU failed to generate more offense.\n\nClaire Timm got the Cowgirls' first hit of the day with a single to right-center field, but she was stranded after a groundout to end the inning. Still scoreless in the middle of the second.\n\nOU's offensive struggles continued in the top of the first inning Sunday.\n\nJayda Coleman and Ella Parker grounded out. Tiare Jennings, who is hitless this weekend, struck out. The Sooners forced OSU starting pitcher Ivy Rosenberry to throw 17 pitches.\n\nOSU got a one-out walk by Tallen Edwards, but couldn't do anything with it. Caroline Wang grounded into a 5-4-3 double play to end the inning.\n\nBoth coaches have been through their bullpens this weekend, so there are no surprises left, but each team will start a veteran in the circle Sunday.\n\nOU will start super-senior Karlie Keeney, a right-hander who has appeared in both games in relief. She has not allowed a run in 2 \u2153 innings against the Cowgirls.\n\nOSU will return to Saturday's starter, Ivy Rosenberry, who allowed a run on three hits over four innings in the 6-2 win.\n\nPerhaps the most tangible stakes for the Bedlam series finale are in Big 12 Tournament seeding. OSU and OU are tied in the standings at 21-5, and Texas has already claimed the regular season title at 23-4.\n\nHere's how the seeding battle looks:\n\n*Winner finishes second and will play its first-round game at 1:30 p.m. Thursday at USA Softball Hall of Fame Stadium. The No. 2 seed won't know its opponent until Wednesday, but will face the winner of the play-in game between seventh-seeded Kansas and 10th-seeded Houston.\n\n*Loser finishes third and will face sixth-seeded BYU at 11 a.m. Thursday.\n\n*Regardless of the outcome, OSU and OU are locked into the second and third seeds, so they will align for a semifinal matchup if they both win Thursday.\n\n-- Scott Wright, Staff writer\n\nMore: How will OU softball respond to first Bedlam series loss since 1997?

Following Saturday's 6-2 loss, OU head coach Patty Gasso said her team hasn't been playing complete games.\n\nWhile not perfect, OU was better in its regular-season finale.\n\nSenior right-hander Karlie Keeney started and allowed four hits, while striking out three Cowgirl hitters and walking four in 6 \u2154 shutout innings. Sophomore left-hander Kierston Deal entered in the sixth and allowed two runs on three hits while getting just one out.\n\nWhile Deal boasted a dominant 1.32 ERA entering Sunday, she's struggled out of the bullpen all season.\n\nLeft fielder Rylie Boone and designated player Ella Parker each finished with three-hit games. Boone went 3 for 3 at the plate with a run scored, while Parker had three RBIs, a double and a home run.\n\nAfter three scoreless innings, OU freshman Kasidi Pickering lasered a two-run home run to left center field to open the game's scoring. Pickering's home run was the Sooners' first of the series.\n\nThe Cowgirls tied the game with two runs in the top half of the sixth before Oklahoma exploded in the bottom frame. Jayda Coleman singled to left center, scoring Boone.\n\nParker and Tiare Jennings' sixth-inning homers put the game out of reach. Parker smacked a three-run shot to deep center field, scoring Maya Bland and Coleman, while Jennings hit a solo shot that was confirmed after replay review.\n\nClouds covered Love's Field for five innings Sunday before the sun shone through to start the sixth inning as 4,528 looked on. OU's new stadium welcomed 86,581 fans in its debut season.\n\nGasso will seemingly be more pleased with the Sooners' complete effort on Sunday.\n\nHere are some other takeaways from the Sooners' win:\n\nSenior Karlie Keeney earned her fourth start of the season in the circle.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Keeney tossed nine innings and allowed just four hits and zero runs. Entering Sunday's contest, the Liberty transfer had thrown 2 1/3 scoreless innings in the series.\n\nKeeney faced her former teammate this weekend. Oklahoma State catcher Caroline Wang caught for Keeney at Liberty.\n\nSunday's win marked the final regular-season home game for perhaps the greatest senior class in collegiate softball history.\n\nOU's 10 seniors Rylie Boone, Alyssa Brito, Jayda Coleman, Kinzie Hansen, Tiare Jennings, Karlie Keeney, Riley Ludlam, Kelly Maxwell, Nicole May and Alynah Torres were celebrated postgame during a senior day celebration. Entering the contest, group held a .948 winning percentage.\n\n\"I think I take them for granted,\" Gasso told ESPN's Holly Rowe during Sunday's game. \"I think a lot of people take them for granted. But they're the best I've ever coached. Each year they go on, the harder it gets.\"\n\nOne of OU's most memorable senior day traditions is having the senior players' parents toss the first pitches. The parents even joined in on the pregame huddle.\n\nEach senior's numbers lined the left field fence on Sunday.\n\nWith the win, the Sooners clinched the No. 2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament. OU will face the winner of Houston and Kansas for its first game in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Gasso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Gasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlam_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bedlam Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_University\u2013Stillwater", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complete game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norman, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norman, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayda_Coleman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayda Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiare_Jennings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiare Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Rowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holly Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Dominoes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Dominoes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542088", "eventUri": "eng-9542088", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norman, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The Sooners graduate senior got the starting nod in the final game of not only the series vs. Oklahoma State, but also the regular season on Sunday.\n\nShe put together arguably her best performance all year in leading OU to an 8-2 victory to avoid being swept. Keeney pitched a season-high 6.2 scoreless innings, striking out three and allowing just four hits to improve her record to 5-1.\n\nThe only time the Cowgirls scored Sunday was when Kierston Deal came in to relieve Keeney in the sixth inning. However, after quickly giving up two runs, Oklahoma again called on Keeney to re-enter the game. She closed the game out to secure the win.\n\nSooners coach Patty Gasso was elated to see that type of game from Keeney, particularly after the struggles OU had dropped games on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"It was probably the highlight of the game to us because she's been waiting in the wings,\" Gasso said. \"She'll come in and fill a hole here or there, but when we pulled her out we thought, 'it's time.' We haven't let her go a full game. When (Deal) got in trouble, the answer was to bring her back in and see what that looks like.\n\n\"She handled it like a pro. It just makes us really confident going forward that she's ready to go in in the tough moments.\"\n\nKeeney has started in just four games for Oklahoma this season after transferring from Liberty. She leads the team with a 1.40 ERA across 55 innings pitched, the fourth-most on the team.\n\nWith postseason play on the horizon, it was the kind of performance the Sooners will hope to see more of from Keeney moving forward.

That sounds crazy to say for the back-to-back-to-back national champions but stay with me here.\n\nEntering the bottom of the sixth inning against Oklahoma State on Sunday, OU was shook. Still fighting, for sure, but definitely not the super power the softball world has come to know.\n\nA 2-2 game turned into an 8-2 rout for the Sooners. A six-spot to remember? The confidence was back. The mojo, too? That's what we're about to find out as OU heads to the Big 12 Tournament this week in Oklahoma City.\n\nNo. 2-seeded Sooners take on No. 7 Kansas at 1:30 p.m. Thursday in the quarterfinals. OU swept the Jayhawks in Lawrence earlier this season.\n\nBut the road to another Big 12 crown? Could feature No. 3 OSU and No. 1 Texas. Two teams that gave OU four of its six losses this season.\n\n\"I think this team is a team that likes the opportunity to get - whoever might have beaten them - they hope to see them again to make it right or revenge tour or whatever you want to call it,\" head coach Patty Gasso said. \"There are things we can gain from this weekend.\n\n\"If we can win it all, likely going through some really good teams, which would help maybe move us. We honestly don't care if we're No. 1, 2, 4, 5, as long as we're in the eight and home throughout? That's what we're looking for.\"\n\nIt's weird seeing the two seed. It's even stranger seeing a No. 4 overall national ranking in the latest polls. But polls don't mean much this time of year, just how well you're playing.\n\nOU will be in the top eight, staying in Norman and Love's Field and just has to return to that championship form that it knows so well.\n\n\"We've had long conversations about this is the last thing you're going to do as a senior and what you want to remember the most,\" Gasso said. \"Don't try too hard. When they have fun, that's why we were late today. They were having so much fun on the field. They were competing in a way that I hadn't seen them to do in a while. Really love the direction we're going right now.\n\n\"They look to put it all together at the right time. The Big 12 Tournament, of course, we want to win it. But we want to see our steps going in the right direction. Ultimately, we're after winning all of it.\"\n\nLurking in the shadows might not be the right term, but here comes Karlie Keeney for the Sooners. The Liberty transfer was electric in all three Bedlam games.\n\nStopping the bleeding Friday and Saturday and delivering a gem of an outing from the starting and relief role Sunday.\n\n\"She's just a program guy. She's just very in tune with what's going on,\" Gasso said. \"Handles her work like a professional. And she's a team person. She's just always in it. She's not pouting and boo-hooing and I should be this or that, she's just waiting for her turn and she's just a wonderful example of a good team player and a hard worker and everything you would want out of a pitcher or just an athlete.\n\n\"It was almost kind of a matter of time when this was going to be her time and she grabbed it. She shined and gives us some great options going forward.\"\n\nKeeney said the pinkie injury of the fall is officially a thing of the past. She's ready to go out with a bang.\n\nSomebody needs to tell freshman Ella Parker you're supposed to tense up and be tight in this moment. There was no bigger hit in that six-run sixth than Parker's three-run home run.\n\nParker has been brilliant, not just for a freshman. But also her ability to go from one spot in the lineup to another and not blink has been truly impressive.\n\n\"It was interesting when she first came. She was very nervous and shaky somewhat,\" Gasso said. \"She had a lot to learn, and she did. But hitting-wise, that's always been something -- she was heavily recruited for specifically that. But some freshman come in with an attitude like, 'I know how to hit. This is the way I hit.'\n\n\"And they don't want JT's help. But when they surrender and they believe in what he's doing, and she did, they go to another level. So she surrendered that really quickly, as did Kasidi Pickering. And I can't see them not in this lineup with the way they're both swinging.\"\n\nNine, count them, nine all-conference honors for the Sooners.

Each of the Sooners' contests can be heard on 1560 AM/103.3 FM The Franchise 2 and 107.7 FM The Franchise.\n\nThe Phillips 66 Big 12 Softball Championship begins Wednesday evening at OGE Energy Field at Devon Park as No. 7-seed Kansas faces 10th-seeded Houston and eighth-seeded Texas Tech squares off with No. 9-seed Iowa State in the first round.\n\nThursday's quarterfinals pair (3) Oklahoma State and sixth-seeded BYU, No. 4 Baylor and No. 5 UCF, top-seeded Texas and the winner of Texas Tech/Iowa State while OU will meet the winner of Kansas and Houston.\n\nThe semifinals are set for Friday evening at 5 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. with Saturday's championship game scheduled for a 6:30 p.m. CT first pitch.\n\nA brilliant start from graduate right-hander and a six-run sixth inning powered then-No. 2-ranked Oklahoma to an 8-2 win over No. 4/4 Oklahoma State on Sunday afternoon at Love's Field, closing the final Big 12 Bedlam Presented by Phillips 66 series.\n\nThe Sooners punctuated senior day by out-hitting Oklahoma State 13-7 on the day. OU now owns a 103-74 advantage in Bedlam including a 45-23 mark in Norman.\n\nKeeney provided Oklahoma with a gem in her final regular-season start, tossing 6.2 shutout innings while scattering four hits and striking out three. The right-hander improved to 5-1 on the season and needed just 81 pitches to record 20 outs.\n\nSenior left fielder recorded a 3-for-3 day at the plate to join as Sooners with three-hit games.\n\nA league-leading nine Oklahoma Softball players have been named All-Big 12 while graduate catcher earned defensive player-of-the-year honors, the league announced Wednesday.\n\nHansen and senior outfielder were unanimous selections to the All-Big 12 First Team, joined by graduate left-handed pitcher and senior infielders and to provide OU with five first-team honorees, sharing the conference lead with Texas. Senior outfielder , sophomore left-handed pitcher , freshman utility and senior infielder added second-team recognition while Parker and outfielder were named to the All-Big 12 Freshman Team.\n\nOklahoma's nine All-Big 12 members stand as the program's highest mark since 10 Sooners earned all-league honors in 1996. Hansen becomes OU's sixth-straight and ninth overall defensive player-of-the year and is the third Sooner catcher to be crowned the league's top defender, following Heather Scaglione (2004-05) and Lindsey Vandever (2010).\n\nUnder head coach , 250 Sooners have earned All-Big 12 honors, 19 have added all-freshman team accolades and 11 have been named defensive player-of-the-year.\n\nSenior shortstop legacy continues to grow in her final collegiate season. The Sooner captain added two major milestones to her resume last weekend at UCF, recording her 300th RBI and 90th home run. She enters the Big 12 tournament tied for fourth across the NCAA record books with 92 career homers and is sixth in RBIs with 301.\n\nJenny Dalton is the NCAA's all-time leader in RBIs with 328, putting Jennings 27 RBIs away from tying the national career record.\n\nJennings is Oklahoma's career leader in doubles, ranks second in RBIs and extra-base hits while standing third in batting average, hits and home runs.\n\nThe Sooners have won eight Big 12 postseason titles under and own a 52-19 record at the conference tournament. OU earned the tournament crown in 1996, '01, '07, '10, '17, '18, '21 and most recently in '23. Since the conference's first championship in 1996, 94 Sooners have earned all-tournament honors and eight have claimed most-outstanding-player laurels.\n\nNewly-crowned Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year has provided Oklahoma with stellar defense behind the dish in her final collegiate campaign. Hansen owns just three errors over 214.0 innings at catcher while throwing out five runners at a 35.7% caught-stealing rate. The graduate student has allowed only 14 wild pitches this season and did not commit an error in conference play.\n\nGraduate right-hander starred in the circle for Oklahoma in Bedlam, tossing 10.0 shutout innings including 6.2 scoreless frames on Sunday to secure a win. The veteran limited opponents to bat .121 with just four hits, striking out five and walking four.\n\nOklahoma's dangerous lineup has taken its collective approach to another level in 2024, posting some of its best walk and strikeout marks in program history.\n\nThe Sooners are walking in 16.7% of their plate appearances, up from 12.6% in 2023, which would also stand as the program's second-highest clip all-time. OU's walk rate is the highest since it drew walks at a program-record 17.5% rate in 2013.\n\nAs a lineup, Oklahoma strikes out in just 8.1% of its trips, currently standing as an all-time best mark in program history. The OU K rate is down from 8.7% in 2023 as the Sooners hold a 135:279 K:BB ratio at the plate.\n\nSophomore left-hander has enjoyed a phenomenal stretch over her last 12 starts, continuing her rise as one of the Big 12's top young talents in the circle. Deal has won 11 of her last 12 starts, going 11-0 with a miniscule 0.37 ERA across 57.0 innings in that span. She has struck out 57 while walking just 11, holding opponents to a .109 average and a meager four extra-base hits.\n\nThe Sooners enter the week ranked highly across the national leaderboards in multiple statistical categories. OU leads the nation in on-base percentage (.473), is top-three in batting average (2nd, .364), slugging percentage (2nd, .656), shutouts (2nd, 21), OPS (2nd, 1.130), runs per game (2nd, 8.12) and home runs (3rd, 98) while ranking fourth in fielding percentage (.981) and 10th in ERA (1.85).\n\nThe Sooners slid back two spots to No. 4 in both the USA Today/NFCA Coaches Poll and the ESPN.com/USA Softball poll this week, marking the first time since week 2 of the 2021 season that OU has not been ranked as one of the top-two teams in the country.\n\nFor updates and more information on Oklahoma

over to third after a fielder's choice, seized on a wild pitch to score and cap off the three-run inning.\n\nMaxwell had to work out of a jam again in the third.\n\nKansas put two runners aboard with

The Sooners didn't just avoid being swept at home in Bedlam, but they looked like a team its fans recognized again in the 8-2 win over OSU.\n\nIt wasn't enough to win the Big 12, but OU enters this week's tournament as the No. 2 seed. The Sooners will play the winner of the Kansas-Houston matchup at 1:30 p.m. Thursday at OGE Field at Devon Park (formerly Hall of Fame Stadium).\n\nHead coach Patty Gasso was back holding court Tuesday afternoon, recapping what was. And now looking toward what is and will be.\n\n\"Really excited the way we played on Sunday. Much more like Sooner softball style. I think there were a lot of exhales after that. It was late, but it was better than never. Found some great things from Karlie Keeney which was good. And the freshman are just continuing to -- sometimes they're carrying us. But they're pretty elite freshmen. So I like how we finished and we had a really good day today and I'm trusting that we're going to get through finals well enough so on Thursday we can really get focused on what we're trying to do.\"\n\n\"I thought Nicole May last weekend threw pretty dang well. I think KD (Kierston Deal) threw really well out at UCF. Sometimes I don't know that they're used to coming in out of the bullpen or what have you. I knew this was gonna be a big weekend for Kelli. But it's all about trusting what you've got and your confidence. If you're second guessing or, 'I'm not sure. I don't know that I'm ready to throw that pitch,' or whatever it is that you're thinking, you've just gotta be a boss and have that mentality like, 'I'm getting after you.' ... You're-not-beating-me attitude.\n\n\"I think sometimes we try to be very finesse or fine tuning. Sometimes you've gotta rear back and just go after it. I thought Keeney looked that way. You could see it in her face and body language. I think when Nicole May does that, they need to sustain it.\n\n\"What has been happening to us a little bit is say a walk, a ball up the middle, then a ball out of the park. We have to keep the ball in the yard, and we will win games. We have to minimize walks, hit batters. That's something we're really working on. I think sometimes we try to be so perfect that we're not even close to it.\n\n\"I think it's allowing us to kind of exhale to be honest. And just, you're supposed to win every game every day. Every day we play, every team, doesn't matter. Sweep the series. I mean, that's the expectation. I think it's our expectation. It can become smothering at times. And so, I like to see, I'm really anxious to see the response at the Big 12 tournament. What they look like, how hungry they are. And just if they're freed up. They were handcuffed all weekend. And no disrespect, we got flat out beaten. But we definitely were not close to being our best. And that's where we need to be. So, this Big 12 tournament is going to tell a story for our future as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_przybylo@on3.com", "name": "Bob Przybylo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Gasso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patty Gasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Park,_South_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devon Park, South Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Devon Park, South Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlam_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bedlam Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Central_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Central Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/08085922/Jayda-Coleman7-e1715176832426.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542088", "eventUri": "eng-9542088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

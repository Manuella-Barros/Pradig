There\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019d use a baby as a human shield like Martin Sheen in The Dead Zone. However, a specific demographic of Americans \u2014 \u201cdummies\u201d \u2014 still admires him. The Times ran an article Tuesday titled \u2018Antihero\u2019 or \u2018Felon\u2019: 11 Undecided Voters Struggle With How to See Trump Post-Verdict. These geniuses, on which our democracy hinges, aren\u2019t quite sure how to view a man convicted of 34 felony counts and who, a jury determined, repeatedly defamed the woman he sexually assaulted. The word \u201ccriminal\u201d seems an ideal descriptor, but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. When asked \u201cafter the Trump verdict, what word best describes how you feel about Donald Trump,\u201d John, a 58-year-old white man from Pennsylvania, said \u201cmartyred,\u201d because he apparently didn\u2019t get enough love in his childhood. Wendy, a 57-year-old Black woman from New York, said \u201cunpredictable but memorable,\u201d which is how I describe the woman I dated in 2004, who claimed she\u2019d been abducted by aliens. This is gonna be one of those focus groups, isn\u2019t it? From the Times: The idea of voting for a felon for president was unacceptable, un-American or too unreal for several of our participants, including some of those who gave Mr. Trump credit for managing the economy. Others thought Democrats pushed these felony charges to help Mr. Biden politically, saying that the Biden campaign was trying to exploit the verdict. Seems like the whole point of a journalistic enterprise is to correct obvious misinformation. There was no political motive behind Trump\u2019s prosecution. He just kept committing crimes in broad daylight, and America at least tries to have a reasonably fair criminal justice system. (Yes, I know it\u2019s hard to read the last half of that sentence without laughing.) But the Times isn\u2019t in the business of telling people they\u2019re wrong. That\u2019s where I come in. James, a 53-year-old white man from Iowa, complained, \u201cthey\u2019ve been going after Trump since he was elected in 2016.\u201d (Because Trump is a criminal.) \u201cDemocracy is supposed to be about the will of the people. I don\u2019t really think the majority of the people in this country wanted to see him prosecuted on these charges.\u201d (Most Americans agree with the verdict and believe Trump was guilty.) Jorge, a 52-year-old Latino man from California, said, \u201cI think Donald Trump would never have a fair trial in New York because, like many people said, most of the jury was probably Democrat. It\u2019s like if we have a trial for Biden in Houston.\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team agreed to the jury that returned the guilty verdict. Also, Houston is in Harris County, which Biden carried 56 to 42 percent. If he were to falsify business records in Houston to cover up payments to an adult film star, he\u2019d first need to set up a business in Houston. Once he\u2019s done that and shamelessly cheated on his wife and coerced the adult film star into sex, he\u2019d probably get a decent shake in Houston, but that sounds like a lot of work. Defaming Tony Soprano The Times advises that we \u201ccheck out the feisty exchange in the group about Tony Soprano,\u201d who some voters in the focus group compare to Trump. It was once a dealbreaker when presidential candidates reminded voters of famous fictional gangsters, but in Trump\u2019s case, it\u2019s giving him too much credit. Jonathan, a 37-year-old Black man from Florida, said, \u201cTrump is not a moral compass to a lot of his supporters. He\u2019s the bad guy that\u2019ll do things on our behalf. He\u2019s the Tony Soprano or the Walter White \u2014\u201d Ben, a 42-year-old white college adviser, responded, \u201cDon\u2019t bring my Sopranos into this.\u201d That\u2019s a fair point. I should clarify again that Tony Soprano is a gangster and a murderer. Walter White from Breaking Bad is a drug kingpin and a murderer. These characters both have entires in the Villains Wiki. Ruthless killers aren\u2019t ideal models for a US president, but maybe I\u2019m as naive as Kay in The Godfather. Jonathan insisted that Trump\u2019s an \u201cantihero,\u201d leading an exasperated Ben to literally invoke Joe Biden: \u201cCome on, man!\u201d The ironically named Hillary, a 55-year-old white social worker from California, said, \"Jonathan, when you brought up The Sopranos, I got it. He\u2019s the antihero. And that\u2019s why I cast a vote in 2016 for him, though I did expect at the time that a lot of the shtick was just shtick and that once elected, if elected, no grown 71-year-old man would comport himself in the way he did.\u201d It\u2019s bad enough that Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t sweep the \u201cHillary\u201d vote, but this Hillary actually went with the Tony Soprano candidate instead? And even after Trump didn\u2019t live up to her very high New Jersey gangster standards, she\u2019s still willing to consider him again in 2024? This is too absurd for even Camus. Hillary goes on: \u201cWhat does that portend, though, for a democracy if we have nothing but antiheroes, going forward? That these people, these complicated, murky, ambiguous, morally ambiguous people, are the models? And maybe that\u2019s putting it mildly and gently. What does that portend for our system of government?\u201d These are certainly compelling questions \u2026 that an idiot would ask. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Joe Biden are \u201cantiheroes.\u201d They\u2019re just normal Democrats who also aren\u2019t psychopaths. It\u2019s not great TV, but I prefer to keep my Emmy-winning psychopaths safely inside the TV and not in the White House. Antiheroes in fiction are defined by their lack of idealism, courage and morality. That\u2019s great for film noir, but it\u2019s not a good look for the commander-in-chief of the world\u2019s most powerful military. The key difference between an antihero and a traditional villain is that the antihero tries, at least initially, to do the right thing, but goes about it in destructive ways. I\u2019ve seen no evidence that Trump has ever possessed positive motivations. He\u2019s a two-dimensional villain. People often confuse antiheroes with villain protagonists. Henry Hill in Goodfellas is a straight-up villain. He\u2019s somewhat sympathetic and far less sinister than most of the other characters in the film, but he only ever does the right thing when his life literally depends on it and he still regrets it. Antiheroes tend to feel helpless in a world over which they have no control. Think the narrator in Fight Club. Jonathan likely considers himself the antihero in the show no one would watch. Trump appeals to him as the strongman Tyler Durden of his imagination. He says: You have to remember why Trump is the choice of millions of people. Trump represents a shock to the system. His supporters don\u2019t hold him to the same ethical standards. He\u2019s the antihero, the Soprano, the Breaking Bad, the guy who does bad things, who is a bad guy but does them on behalf of the people he represents. The MAGA cult is convinced that Trump gives a damn about them. He doesn\u2019t. Trump does possess the selfishness, cynicism, ignorance and bigotry of most antiheroes, but he isn\u2019t in the same league as Tony Soprano or Walter White. However, I wouldn\u2019t mind if he shares their fate.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/former-u-s-president-donald-trump-afp.jpg?id=25444803&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C5%2C0%2C5\"/><br/><br/><p>Convicted felon Donald Trump has absolutely no heroic qualities.

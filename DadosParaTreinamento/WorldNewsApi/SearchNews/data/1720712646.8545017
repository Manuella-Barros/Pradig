{"id": 232061600, "title": "Why is Lee Mack playing for Soccer Aid World XI team and not England?", "text": "Lee Mack is taking to the pitch today for Soccer Aid 2024 \u2013 but why is he on the World XI team? The comedian and actor is known for jobs such as Not Going Out and presenting ITV's The 1% Club and this year will play alongside the likes of Roman Kemp, Martin Compston, Tommy Fury and Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge today. Since kickstarting in 2006, the event has raised an eye-watering \u00a390 million for the charity, helping those in need in countries such as Cambodia. But while the likes of Tom Grennan, Bobby Brazier, Erin Doherty and Jill Scott will be part of the England team, many will be wondering why Lee is on World XI. However, there is a very simple reason for this. Lee, 55, was born in Southport, Merseyside, he actually has Irish roots. The comic had appeared on the BBC One show, Who Do You Think You Are? which saw him explore his Irish heritage. He had previously played on the England team but ultimately made the move to World XI who are currently the undefeated champions of the match. Speaking about Lee's move to World XI, Roman Kemp previously told the Mirror: \"It's a lot of fun playing on that team and Lee Mack joined us a couple of years ago and it shows how much fun he's had.\" For the upcoming game, the England team will have a specifically designed Euro '96 kit remake, just five days before the Euros 2024 kicks off. Meanwhile, World XI will wear a specially designed and limited edition Adidas kit. Amidst the cost of living crisis, bosses have found ways to make Soccer Aid 2024 affordable for families, with a ticket for a family of four including two children and two adults costing just \u00a360. Co-creator Robbie Williams said of the 2024 match: \"Soccer Aid for UNICEF is one of the biggest sources of joy in my life. It is an amazing event. When we launched this nearly two decades ago, I would never have dreamed it would raise as much money as it has. The main reason the match continues to be such a success is because the great British public continues to be so generous in supporting UNICEF's work helping children around the world have happy, healthy, play-filled childhoods. Once again, I am kindly asking you to buy a ticket to the game on Sunday 9th June at Stamford Bridge \u2013 the line-up is as star-studded as ever! Thank you for all of your continued support.\" Since launching in 2006, England has won five times but their last win was in 2018. Soccer Aid World XI have won seven times and last year saw them take the champion title for the fifth year on the run. Money raised from the event will help Unicef protect children from disease and malnutrition as well as supporting their mental health and assisting during times of crisis in wartorn countries.", "summary": "Soccer Aid is back this weekend with an impressive line-up hoping to raise millions for UNICEF but celebs such as Roman Kemp and Lee Mack are playing for World XI leaving people baffled", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lee-mack-playing-soccer-aid-32950009", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32950237.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Soccer-Aid-for-UNICEF-2024-Launch-tickets-on-sale.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:10:33", "author": "Daniel Bird,Danielbirdwrites", "authors": ["Daniel Bird", "Danielbirdwrites"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.512}

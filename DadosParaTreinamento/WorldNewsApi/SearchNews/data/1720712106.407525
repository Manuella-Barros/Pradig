We're getting that feedback also in relation to the European elections. \"So from that point of view, we're pretty happy at the moment. It's early days yet really. We're getting down to filling the seats now with the third, fourth and fifth counts so there's still a lot to play for,\" said Mr Collins. Turning to the mayoral election, Mr Collins said Dee Ryan, the Fianna Fail candidate, put in a phenomenal performance. \"John Moran is obviously the leader. Helen O'Donnell is one percentage point ahead of Dee Ryan, who's lying in third place. So it's all to play for if Maurice Quinlivan is to be eliminated and if Daniel Butler is to be eliminated - a lot of transfers will come into play. \"It's a big ask, I would think, to see John Moran passed out at this point in time, but look, we don't know. Counts often take a kind of a twist that we don't expect but in any event I think Dee Ryan put in a phenomenal performance for Fianna F\u00e1il. She was new to politics, as a first time candidate, and she campaigned really, really strongly and progressively. \"I think that she really has a bright future on the political landscape and within Fianna F\u00e1il,\" said Mr Collins. Possibly running as a TD in the future, asks Limerick Live. \"Look, who knows, she certainly has all the material to make a really, really fine public representative and she's demonstrated that wholeheartedly. \"She has fabulous ideas, she was a brilliant campaigner and she's exactly the type of candidate that we in Fianna F\u00e1il want, and, indeed, that any party would want. She would make a great public representative for Limerick,\" said Mr Collins.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_09/IMG-3140-1717933262453.jpg--.jpg?1717933263833\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />MINISTER of State Niall Collins said the big trend is that Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael's support is holding up while Sinn Fein voters have switched, predominantly, to Independents. \"That seems to be mirrored here in Limerick and right around the country.

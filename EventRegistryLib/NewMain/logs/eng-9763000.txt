Discovery's \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Harry Potter\". The bundle also includes upcoming premieres such as \"Only Murders in the Building\" season 4 on Hulu, \"Agatha All Along\" on Disney Plus and \"The Penguin\" on Max.\n\nTo support the launch, a comprehensive national marketing campaign has been rolled out, featuring a cross-platform blitz across broadcast, social media, digital channels and each platform's own channels. This campaign will highlight fan-favorite TV shows, movies and characters from the bundle's extensive collection, ensuring that subscribers are well-informed about the wealth of content now at their fingertips.\n\nWith this new bundle, Disney Plus, Hulu and Max aim to provide a more streamlined and cost-effective way for you to access your favorite content from so many different genres and studios.\n\nNew and existing subscribers can now get the combined Disney Plus, Hulu and Max bundle for $16.99 per month with ads or $29.99 per month without ads. The ad-supported option provides a discount of up to 38.8% compared to buying each service individually (Disney Plus basic at $7.99, Hulu with ads at $7.99 and Max with ads at $9.99).\n\nFor the ad-free bundle, subscribers can enjoy nearly 35% in savings compared to the standard monthly prices of $13.99 for Disney Plus premium, $17.99 for Hulu without ads and $16.99 for Max ad-free.\n\nThe new bundle offers plenty of content from the media companies' extensive brand portfolios, including Disney, HBO, Hulu, Warner Bros. Pictures, FX, ABC, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, Star Wars, CNN, DC, Discovery, Food Network and HGTV.\n\nThe media companies aim to increase user engagement and decrease cancellations by providing a discounted bundle. Similarly, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp. are preparing to launch the Venu Sports bundle of live channels this October.\n\nThis Disney Plus, Hulu and Max bundle reflects an effort to replicate the bundled approach of traditional pay TV, which has been declining as more affordable streaming options gain popularity. So, if you're tired of going between different platforms to find your next watch, this bundle could be your savior.\n\nYou can only subscribe to the Disney Plus, Hulu and Max bundle through direct purchases on either of the three websites. Current subscribers can transition from their existing Disney Plus, Hulu or Max plans to this new bundle.

Discovery have partnered to offer a new bundle in the US. Save money by bundling Disney+, Hulu, and Max for $30/month, with ad-supported option at $17/month. Both bundles provide access to a wide range of content from HBO, ABC, Hulu, FX, Marvel, Disney, Warner Bros., Pixar, and Fox.\n\nThe race for the top streaming service is hotter than ever, with fresh content hitting each platform every month. Deciding where to spend your viewing time can be overwhelming. But Disney Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery recently made things easier with their new partnership. Now available in the US, this new streaming bundle includes Disney+, Hulu, and Max, combining their vast and diverse libraries into one convenient subscription.\n\nAccording to Hulu and Disney+'s joint press release, the new offering comes in two options. The ad-free bundle costs $30 per month, saving you $6 compared to buying each service separately. Normally, Disney+ and Hulu together with ad-free Max would cost $36 a month. If you're looking to save even more without missing out on content, there's an ad-supported bundle available for $17 per month, which cuts $10 off your monthly bill.\n\nRelated What is Disney Plus?\n\nEverything you need to know about Disney+\n\nNo matter which subscription you choose, both bundles give you access to a huge content library featuring big names like HBO, ABC, Hulu, FX, Marvel, Disney, Warner Bros., Pixar, and Fox.\n\nThis bundle is a great pick for those already using Disney+, Hulu, and Max, or anyone looking to dive into all their content without paying for each one separately. With recent price increases on these services, getting them all together in one deal is more appealing than ever.\n\nBundles are here to save the day\n\nAs individual streaming subscriptions keep getting more expensive, people are turning to bundles to save money. Besides the new Disney-Hulu-Max bundle, there's also a special Max and Netflix combo available only to Verizon customers. Comcast also has a sweet new offer that bundles Peacock, Apple TV+, and Netflix into one convenient package for a single price.\n\nThe launch of the new bundle is a clever way to bring back the convenience of old-school pay-TV, which has been losing out to cheaper streaming options. If you're tired of switching between apps for your shows and movies, this bundle makes it easy to have everything in one spot.", "source": {"uri": "androidpolice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Police"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery and Disney launched a cross-studio bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and Max on Thursday, bringing the services together at a discounted price as the entertainment giants look to scale their streaming businesses.\n\nThe companies said the bundle of the three services, which was first announced in May, is available to new and returning subscribers for $16.99 a month with ads, or $29.99 a month without ads -- an up to 38% savings over the standalone pricing of each platform.\n\nThe lowest priced Max plan is currently offered at $9.99 a month with ads. Disney+ with Hulu is also available for $9.99 a month with ads.\n\nThe new bundle offers subscribers access to a wider array of programming, including the premium service HBO, and content from ABC, CNN, Discovery, Food Network, FX, HGTV, Hulu, Pixar, and the Star Wars franchise. The collaborative effort also brings together two major comic-book rivals, Warner Bros.' DC and Disney's Marvel, in a single package.\n\nThe launch of the bundle comes as WBD, the parent company of CNN, and Disney, which owns both Disney+ and Hulu, look to woo and retain subscribers in a battle against larger streaming rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\"We have found that when you bundle together with other content that more people in the family like -- on a very basic level -- the more often you watch the product, the more people in the family that watch the product, the lower the churn,\" WBD chief executive David Zaslav said this spring.\n\nThe emergence of the combined services at a discounted rate resembles the traditional cable television bundle that consumers have relied upon for decades, offering up to hundreds of channels for one monthly price. Disney already offers its own streaming bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ at a bargain rate. In December, Verizon announced a new subscription that paired Netflix and Max's ad-supported tiers for $10 a month, a deal that, for an additional $10, also includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN.\n\nSmaller streaming platforms have struggled in recent years to retain subscribers in an increasingly crowded sector that also includes NBC's Peacock, Paramount+, and Apple TV+. Earlier this week, Peacock parent company Comcast announced the service had shed 500,000 subscribers in its most recent quarter.\n\nOthers are also jumping into the already-crowded streaming fray. Earlier this month, Hallmark announced that it, too, will launch its own standalone streaming platform, Hallmark+, ahead of the holiday season.\n\nDisney, WBD and Fox Corp. are also launching the dedicated sports streaming service Venu this fall, which will combine ESPN, TNT, Fox Sports and other assets under a single streaming roof.\n\n\"We've watched for years the decline of the linear bundle on cable and satellite and we've been preparing for a world where that business is not as strong as it used to be,\" Disney chief executive Bob Iger told CNBC in February. \"I'd rather be a disruptor than to be disrupted.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Discovery -- are now available to stream for a reduced monthly price.\n\nStarting Thursday, July 25, the new Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming bundle goes on sale in the U.S. Eligible new and existing subscribers can purchase the three-way bundle for $16.99/month with ads and $29.99/month without ads.\n\nOn the ad-supported side, that's a savings of up to 38.8% compared with the price of the services purchased separately (Disney+ Basic at $7.99, Hulu with ads at $7.99, Max With Ads at $9.99). You can save nearly 35% on the no-ads bundle compared with the regular monthly standalone prices (Disney+ Premium at $13.99, Hulu no-ads at $17.99 and Max Ad-Free at $16.99).\n\nDisney and Warner Bros. Discovery -- who are otherwise fierce competitors -- announced plans for the bundle in early May. Available only in the U.S., the bundle provides content from across each media company's portfolio of brands, including Disney, HBO, Hulu, Warner Bros. Pictures, FX, ABC, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, Star Wars, CNN, DC, Discovery, Food Network and HGTV.\n\nThe strategy for the media companies is to boost engagement and reduce churn (i.e., cancelations), given evidence that consumers who take price-discounted bundles have higher retention rates. In a similar tie-up, Disney, WBD and Fox Corp. are angling to launch the Venu Sports bundle of live channels in the fall.\n\nIn a way, the Disney+-Hulu-Max bundle represents a move to reconstitute the consolidated packaging of pay-TV -- which has been steadily eroding for the past several years amid the surge in lower-cost streaming options.\n\nConsumers can only sign up for the Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle via direct-billed purchases on the web directly through the Max, Disney+ or Hulu websites. Existing subs can switch from their current Max, Disney+ or Hulu subscription to the bundle; however, neither Hulu + Live TV or the Max Ultimate Ad-Free plan are available as part of the bundle offer.\n\nIn support of the launch, a coordinated, cross-platform national marketing campaign kicks off today and is focused on each streamer's collection of fan-favorite TV series, films and characters. The carefully tailored campaign includes a robust blitz across national broadcast, social, digital, and owned-and-operated channels. (Watch the 60-second version of the spot below.)\n\nIn industry lingo, the Disney+-Hulu-Max combo is a \"synthetic\" bundle, meaning the services remain operationally separate (i.e., you access each service in its respective app). That's in contrast to a \"hard\" bundle that fully integrates separate streaming packages into one user experience, as Disney has done in merging Hulu into Disney+ for customers of both.\n\nThe new bundle reflects \"a restructuring of how people view content,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in May. \"I went through a generation of disruption -- not quite as big as this -- but, you know, when my career started, when the cable business was a real disruption,\" he said. \"And as we look at what happens ahead, there likely will be a, you know, a restructuring of how people view content.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix -- in a flex reflecting its market-leading position -- told investors last week in its Q2 shareholder letter that it hasn't entered into direct-bundling deals with other streamers like Disney+ or Max \"because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience.\"\n\nDisney and WBD touted the broad swath of content available from the trio of services in the new bundle. The lineup includes \"Family Guy,\" \"Bob's Burgers\" and \"The Simpsons\"; movie franchises like Disney's Frozen, Marvel's Avengers, Star Wars and Pixar's Toy Story; and Warner Bros. Discovery movie and TV franchises like Batman, the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, \"Game of Thrones\" and \"House of the Dragon.\" Upcoming originals premieres include Hulu's \"Only Murders in the Building\" Season 4 (Aug. 27), \"Agatha All Along\" on Disney+ (Sept. 18) and \"The Penguin\" on Max (September).\n\nSEE ALSO: Streaming Bundles Are All the Rage -- but They Can't Bring Back Pay-TV's Glory Days\n\nWatch the 60-second version of the Disney+-Hulu-Max bundle spot:", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery and Disney launched a cross-studio bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and Max on Thursday, bringing the services together at a discounted price as the entertainment giants look to scale their streaming businesses.\n\nThe companies said the bundle of the three services, which was first announced in May, is available to new and returning subscribers for $16.99 a month with ads, or $29.99 a month without ads -- an up to 38% savings over the standalone pricing of each platform.\n\nThe lowest priced Max plan is currently offered at $9.99 a month with ads. Disney+ with Hulu is also available for $9.99 a month with ads.\n\nThe new bundle offers subscribers access to a wider array of programming, including the premium service HBO, and content from ABC, CNN, Discovery, the Food Network, FX, HGTV, Hulu, Pixar, and the Star Wars franchise. The collaborative effort also brings together two major comic-book rivals, Warner Bros.' DC and Disney's Marvel, in a single package.\n\nThe launch of the bundle comes as WBD, the parent company of CNN, and Disney, which owns both Disney+ and Hulu, look to woo and retain subscribers in a battle against larger streaming rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\"We have found that when you bundle together with other content that more people in the family like -- on a very basic level -- the more often you watch product, the more people in the family that watch the product, the lower the churn,\" WBD chief executive David Zaslav said this spring.\n\nSmaller streaming platforms have struggled in recent years to retain subscribers in an increasingly crowded sector that also includes NBC's Peacock, Paramount+, and Apple TV+. Earlier this week, Peacock parent company Comcast announced the service had shed 500,000 subscribers in its most recent quarter.\n\nOthers are also jumping into the already-crowded streaming fray. Earlier this month, Hallmark announced that it, too, will launch its own standalone streaming platform, Hallmark+, ahead of the holiday season.\n\nBut the emergence of the combined services at a discounted price resemble traditional cable television bundles. Disney already offers its own bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. In December, Verizon announced a new streaming subscription that paired Netflix and Max's ad-supported tiers for $10 a month, a deal that, for an additional $10, includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nThe streaming world just got a little more interesting. Disney+ officially launched its new streaming bundle with Hulu and Max (formerly HBO Max) today, with prices starting at $16.99 a month. The streaming giant first announced this bundling back in May, making for a powerful trio of movies and shows for kids and adults. Disney+ already had some enticing bundle offers with its Duo package of Disney+ and Hulu and the Trio package of the first two streamers with ESPN+. Both the Duo and Trio bundles are still available to shoppers, starting at $9.99 a month and $14.99 respectively.\n\nSign up for the newest Disney+ bundle to watch the latest hit shows and movies.\n\nSign up for the Disney+ bundle\n\nLike the other bundles, the Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle features ad-supported and ad-free tiers. The bundle with ads costs $16.99 a month while the bundle without ads costs $29.99 a month. Disney+ notes that members of both tiers can access \"select Hulu content\" on the Disney+ app while \"select HBO content\" will be accessible on the Hulu app. Members of the ad-free tier can also download titles to their mobile devices for on-the-go streaming of hit shows and movies, though \"select live and linear content\" will still have ads. This is likely referring to live NHL broadcasts and news from CNN.\n\nPricing-wise, it's better to have a bundle. Doing the new ad-supported Disney bundle is 35% cheaper than having individual subscriptions of Disney+ ($7.99 a month), Hulu ($7.99 a month) and Max ($10 a month). Meanwhile, the ad-free bundle is 43% cheaper than having individual ad-free subscriptions of Disney+ ($13.99 a month), Hulu ($17.99 a month) and Max ($20.99 a month).\n\nAbsolutely!

You'll save some money and receive all of the same content and benefits. Plus, some Hulu content will appear in the Disney+ app and some HBO content will be in the Hulu app.\n\nWith so many streaming services on the market, choosing between them all can be exhausting.

Discovery announced plans to create a new bundle that includes their signature streaming services. Now, the first details have been revealed about the Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle.\n\nStarting today, the Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle is available with two pricing options. The cheapest one is the ad-supported tier that will run $16.99 a month, while the ad-free tier is nearly double that price at $29.99 a month. The former offers nearly $10 in savings from the combined price of all three ad-supported streamers. The ad-free tiers for each service would have run $37 a month separately, which means the bundle offers the same deal for around $7 less.\n\nEarly adopters of the Ultimate Bundle will be able to catch Max and HBO's The Penguin on September 19, and Disney+'s Agatha All Along on Disney+ on September 18. Disney+ will also have the new Star Wars series, Skeleton Crew, later this year.\n\nNote that only Disney+ and Hulu are available through the same app or on the Disney+ site. Max will continue to be run as a separate app and streaming service. There is a rival super bundle coming from Comcast that will offer Netflix, Peacock, and Apple TV+. But that deal is only available to Comcast subscribers.\n\nOf those three streamers, Netflix has indicated that it will not seek a similar deal directly with its rivals. Earlier this month, a company representative stated that the streamer's willingness to forgo further bundling was \"because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blair_marnell@gamespot.com", "name": "Blair Marnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The streaming bundle that will offer Disney+, Hulu, and Max together for one price is available to U.S. subscribers starting today, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney Entertainment announced today.\n\nFor $16.99/month, you can get all three streamers with ads, and for $29.99/month you can get all three without ads. The release says it's a savings of \"up to\" 38 percent, which is true for the highest-priced ad-free option should you currently be paying for Disney+, Hulu, and Max each separately. The original Disney bundle, which is the duo of Disney+ and Hulu, is $9.99 for the with-ads plan and $19.99 for the ad-free option, so it's more modestly discounted if you were to add a monthly Max subscription on to one of those.\n\nDisney and WBD announced this partnership back in May, but without a launch date or pricing. We doubt it's a coincidence it's launching the day before Peacock wants you to sign up to watch the Olympics.\n\nBundles are all the rage right now to help streamers reduce churn, or the habit of cycling through signing up and cancelling after you've finished watching the show you care to watch. Comcast is offering a deal that gets you Peacock, Apple TV+, and Netflix for one price. And Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney are also teaming up with Fox on a joint venture sports streaming service called Venu. The hope is that the combo of ABC, CNN, DC, Discovery, Disney, Food Network, FX, HBO, HGTV, Hulu, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, Star Wars, Warner Bros., and more will keep folks around for the long haul.\n\nDisney+ has 117.6 million subscribers, Hulu has 45.8 million subs (50.2 if you include those who pay for Hulu + Live TV), and while Warner Bros. Discovery doesn't disclose how many subscribers each individual service has between Max and Discovery+, collectively they have 99.6 million subscribers.\n\nIf streaming bundles are starting to sound a lot like cable but with things still difficult to find, you're not wrong. But the news also comes as companies like Disney are doing everything they can to chase Netflix, making tweaks to algorithms and promo art and even sending people friendly reminder emails to come back and finish the movie you paused halfway through.\n\nNetflix in its recent earnings call suggested that it wasn't looking to partner with any other streamers individually on a bundle, while others like Paramount+ are certainly looking for a partner.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_welk@indiewire.com", "name": "Brian Welk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

This new package, available to both new and existing subscribers, offers a potential discount of up to 38%.\n\nSubscribers to the bundle will enjoy an extensive selection of content from Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and their respective brands. This includes popular franchises such as \"Star Wars,\" \"Marvel,\" \"The Avengers,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Harry Potter,\" and many more. With access to ABC, CNN, DC, Discovery, FX, HBO, Hulu, Pixar, Searchlight, and Warner Bros., viewers can dive into a vast library of movies and TV shows. Upcoming projects like \"Only Murders in the Building\" Season 4 and \"Agatha All Along\" will also be part of the offering.\n\nExpanding the Streaming Landscape\n\nIn addition to this bundle, Disney and Warner Bros.

This combined trio offers up to 38% savings compared to individual service prices. The bundle provides access to popular shows and IPs from Disney+, Max, and Hulu.\n\nA new streaming bundle from Max, Hulu, and Disney+ has now been revealed, offering a new subscription option. Ever since Netflix popularized the streaming option, the last decade has seen the massive expansion of new streaming services, including Prime Video, Max, Hulu, Disney+, Paramount+, and Peacock, among others. In the past several years, the streaming landscape has seen significant changes in terms of pricing, with many services increasing their monthly cost or adding ad-supported tiers at a lower price.\n\nNow, Hulu, Max, and Disney+ are teaming up with a new bundle that includes all three services. The trio of streaming services can be purchased at a monthly rate of $16.99/month with ads, and $29.99/month for an ad-free experience. The streamers estimated that this pricing model represents savings of up to 38% when compared to buying the three services separately.\n\nWhy This Streaming Move Is Powerful This Streaming Trio Boasts Popular Shows and IPs\n\nPrior to this most recent streaming offering, there had already been existing streaming bundles. This included a Hulu and Disney+ combined bundle, which was a popular option for patrons of both services. Hulu with ads has also been made available for student accounts for Spotify premium, giving users another way to access the platform. With the amount of streaming options increasing and competition resultantly rising for the services, bundling can be an effective tool to offer to customers who might otherwise be tempted to ditch a given service.\n\nThe Hulu, Disney+, and Max bundle may be the most powerful offering yet when it comes to combined streaming packages. While it excludes powerhouses Prime Video and Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Max are three of the more popular streaming services out there right now. The bundle creation is especially well-timed for Max and Disney+, as it arrives at the heels of two popular shows: House of the Dragon (Max) and The Acolyte (Disney+). The Acolyte just ended and HOTD still has two more episodes left, so the services can ride this wave.\n\nRelated The 30 Best TV Shows On Disney+ (July 2024)\n\nDisney's streaming service offers a large library of television shows spanning decades. Here are the best TV shows on Disney+ right now.\n\nAnother powerful part of the bundle is the access it will give subscribers to major existing IPs. Disney+ boasts Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar, while Max is home to the entire Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter franchises. Hulu also produces the original show Only Murders in the Building, whose fourth season is being released at the end of the summer. With access to all these titles, subscribers may have a hard time saying no to this latest streaming option, as it collectively hosts most major IPs.\n\nOnly Murders in the Building season 4 is set to debut on August 27.\n\nSource: Disney+, Max, and Hulu", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_gearan@screenrant.com", "name": "Hannah Gearan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ryan_northrup@screenrant.com", "name": "Ryan Northrup", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "stephen_holland@screenrant.com", "name": "Stephen Holland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sophie_humphrey@screenrant.com", "name": "Sophie Humphrey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Flanagan_(filmmaker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Flanagan (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of the Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-6-27.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763000", "eventUri": "eng-9763000", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-27", "textStart": 3177, "textEnd": 3186}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Discovery's Max, is launching today, with both ad-supported and ad-free options.\n\nDisney, which is taking the lead on implementing the bundle, says that the ad-supported tier will cost $16.99 per month, while the ad-free version will cost $29.99 per month.\n\nIf users were to buy all three services individually, they would cost about $26 per month for their ad tiers, or $20 per month if they combined the Disney Bundle (which includes Disney+ and Hulu)with Max. The ad-free versions would cost about $37 combined.\n\nThe bundle was announced back in May, marking a major team-up from streaming competitors. Until now, most bundles have been facilitated by telecom companies like Verizon or cable companies like Comcast. Netflix, for its part, said last week that while it is happy to work with third-party distribution partners on bundles, it does not plan to develop bundles directly with streaming competitors \"because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience.\"\n\nIn the case of the Disney+-Max-Hulu bundle, Disney and Warner Bros.

The package offers a savings of up to 38% compared to subscribing to each service separately, according to the release.\n\nCurrently, Disney+ offers a basic standalone subscription for $7.99 per month with ads, while the ad-free version costs $13.99.

After all, \"free\" deals now come with catches, extra fees and subscriptions often give you access to content you don't even want, and saving money can be difficult when prices always seem to be on the rise. When it was first announced that Disney/Hulu and Max were teaming up for a streaming bundle earlier this year, I was skeptical, as I'm sure many were, that this was yet another too-good-to-be-true deal. However, now that this bundle is available (in the US only, at least for now) it looks like this is the rare streaming deal that actually might save streamers some money, especially if they already subscribe to Max and either Disney+ or Hulu. Let's break it down:\n\nRelated What do Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and other streaming services cost now?\n\nHere's a rundown of how much you can expect to pay for all the different streaming services as of June 2024.\n\nPricing for the Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming bundle No matter which plan you select, you will save money with this new deal HBO\n\nThis new bundle provides unlimited access to the full Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming catalogs and comes in two price options: $16.99/month with ads and $29.99/month without ads.\n\nStreamers who opt to go for the ad-supported plan can net a savings of 15% when compared with the cost of these services purchased separately (The Disney+ Basic duo with Hulu is $9.99/month and Max With Ads is $9.99/month). Though $3 per month in savings might not sound like a lot, it adds up quickly, as that's almost $40 saved over the course of a year, almost enough to purchase an annual Paramount+ Essentials subscription.\n\nOn the no-ads side, this bundle will save streamers almost 20% compared with the regular monthly standalone prices (The Disney Duo premium costs $19.99/ month and the Max Ad-Free plan costs $16.99) for a total annual savings of $84, more than enough to get an annual Peacock Premium subscription.\n\nRelated How to get Disney+ for as cheap as possible\n\nAll the Disney+ discounts and deals you can try to get the streaming service for less.\n\nHow to upgrade to the Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming bundle The process is fairly easy and only takes a few minutes Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming bundle Subscription with ads Yes Premium Subscription Yes Live TV No Price $16.99-$29.99 Free trial No Disney+, Hulu and Max (Ad-Supported)Disney+, Hulu and Max (No Ads)\n\nIf you don't subscribe to any of these services, getting the Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming bundle is easy, as you can simply navigate to either the Max or Disney+ websites, select the Disney+ bundle and subscribe directly. However, if you subscribe to either of these services, here's how you can upgrade:\n\nSign in to Max or Disney+ on your phone, tablet, or computer. Choose your profile and then Subscription. Choose Change Your Plan Choose Bundles and select either Disney+, Hulu and Max With Ads or Disney+, Hulu and Max with No Ads and continue. Review your plan change and choose Confirm.\n\nIf you currently subscribe to Disney+/Hulu and Max separately, and want to upgrade to the bundle, you'll need to follow the process above on one of your accounts, and then cancel the other account to avoid double billing.\n\nRelated Inside Out 2 expected to start streaming on Disney+ this fall\n\nHere's everything we know about when Inside Out 2 will start streaming on Disney+", "source": {"uri": "pocket-lint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocket-lint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/pocket-lint-featured-images-7-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763000", "eventUri": "eng-9763000", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

(You can grab the bundle right here!) The two companies announced the bundle streaming services availability today. In the United States, users can expect to pay $16.99 a month with ads and $29.99 a month without ads as existing subscribers if they opt for the bundle. All in all, that registers as a 38% savings compared to subscribing to the three independently of each other. (To do the math, Disney+ Basic is $7.99, Hulu with ads is $7.99 and Max's ad-based tier is $9.99.) The ad-free bundle also represents a savings of 35% as well. Disney+ Premium is $13.99, Hulu without ads is $17.99 and the Max ad-free tier is $16.99.\n\nBack in May, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney announced their intention to bundle Max, Hulu and Disney+ in the United States. As the streaming error has continued, the companies decided the best course of action was to employ some cut cooperation, instead of carving out their own kingdoms on separate servers. While the content still lives apart, ease of access is probably the way forward. (And including ads just like cable TV used to.) This cooperative spirit even spread to the movies as Disney+ subscribers can enjoy $10 off a ticket to see Deadpool & Wolverine this weekend.\n\nA previous statement from Disney said, \"On the heels of the very successful launch of Hulu on Disney+, this new bundle with Max will offer subscribers even more choice and value.\" Joe Earley, president of direct-to-consumer for Disney Entertainment wrote, \"This incredible new partnership puts subscribers first, giving them access to blockbuster films, originals, and three massive libraries featuring the very best brands and entertainment in streaming today.\"\n\nNetfix Isn't Joining The Bundle Race\n\nWith all this consolidation swirling around, you might wonder if Netflix has some plans to get in on all this bundling. However, the red brand has no intentions to enter the fray like Disney and Warner Bros. have. In a recent letter, Netflix said that they wouldn't be designing a partnership with other streamers because of their excellent performance on their own already. Take a look right here.\n\n\"From the early days of streaming, we saw partnerships with device makers and pay TV and mobile operators as key to ensuring Netflix was easy to find and use. These partnerships are a win-win -- making it simple for people to discover, sign-up, use and pay for Netflix. In turn, our device and operator partners benefit through increased device sales from consumers seeking devices integrated with Netflix and greater customer acquisition and higher retention as well as the opportunity to upsell higher value data or content packages,\" Netflix wrote to shareholders.\n\nThe letter added, \"We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience. This has driven industry leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers.\"\n\nAre you interested in the bundle?

Disney+ and Hulu, which were already both owned by Disney, are working to combine their two streaming services into a single offering. Now, Max, Warner Bros' streaming offering, has joined with Disney+ and Hulu to offer a single bundle that should come at a discounted price.\n\nAs of July 25, U.S. residents can subscribe to Max, Disney+, and Hulu for $16.99/mo. with ads or for $29.99 with no ads. That's a savings of more than 30% whether you subscribe to the ad-supported version or the ad-free version over subscribing to each of the services separately.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDisney and Warner Bros., who are competitors in most areas of entertainment, announced the plan to bundle their streaming services in early May. The bundle is currently only available in the U.S., and subscribers will have access to the entire range of content available across all three services when they subscribe.\n\nThe goal behind this bundle is to reduce the level of cancellations for each service, as evidence suggests that consumers who get a bundled discount are more likely to continue paying. In reality, though, it seems like the first step toward a model in which customers pay for a bunch of services at once, as they once did with their cable packages. Streaming was supposed to move us toward a bright future, but it has in recent years introduced ad-supported tiers, and bundled services together to make them cheaper and more convenient for the end user.

Discovery and Disney launched their new streaming service bundle on Thursday, which packages Disney Plus, Hulu and Max together for US customers. According to a press release, eligible new or existing subscribers can choose to sign up for an ad-free or ad-supported plan through any of the three platforms. The companies first announced the bundle in May and shared that it would be available this summer.\n\nThe ad-based bundle costs $17 per month, while the ad-free version is $30 a month, and each subscription grants access to content from brands such as HBO, ABC, Hulu, FX, Marvel, Disney, Warner Bros., Pixar and Fox. B/R Sports, the live sports streaming tier which is part of Max's platform, is also currently included at no extra charge.\n\nWhether you have standalone subscriptions for each of these services, or one of the four Disney Bundles, this new offering can save you money each month. Max increased the prices of its ad-free plans in June, which bumped them up to $17 and $21 per month. Here's a look at the current price structures for Hulu, Disney Plus and Max, as well as all the bundles available.\n\nThough all three services are now available through a single subscription, there is not a singular log-in to access the trio of services together. However, MyDisney enables users to sign in to Disney Plus and Hulu with a unified log-in if your streaming accounts share the same email address.\n\nThis is one of several streaming bundles to launch recently, with Comcast's StreamSaver rolling out in May. The package is open to Xfinity customers only and combines Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV Plus for a monthly rate of $15.

Years down the line, many observers believe, the experience of streaming will need to reduce a lot more of the friction that currently exists in order to unlock greater financial returns for media companies.\n\nThe pricing news comes just a week after Netflix dismissed the idea of being part of any bundles, apart from more marketing-oriented packages with what it termed \"operator partners\" like Comcast and Verizon. \"We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience,\" Netflix wrote in its quarterly letter to shareholders. \"This has driven industry leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers.\"\n\nOn WBD's most recent earnings call last May, streaming chief JB Perrette called the three-service bundle \"robust\" and said the company didn't believe it needed \"anybody else in that package to make it incredibly compelling.\" Netflix and Prime Video, which had a decade's head start on most of the streaming field, are viewed as \"utilities,\" Perrette added.\n\nIn support of the launch, the bundle partners said, a national marketing campaign will roll out across broadcast TV, social, digital, and owned-and-operated channels.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dade_hayes@deadline.com", "name": "Dade Hayes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

All qualifying new and existing subscribers can purchase the bundle for $16.99/month with ads and $29.99/month without ads - a savings of up to 38% compared with the price of the services purchased separately.\n\nThe premium offering brings the three popular streaming services together all through a single monthly subscription, while providing a wide selection of content from the biggest and most beloved portfolio of brands in entertainment including ABC, CNN, DC, Discovery, Disney, Food Network, FX, HBO, HGTV, Hulu, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, Star Wars, Warner Bros., and many more.\n\nIn support of the launch, a coordinated, cross-platform national marketing campaign kicks off today and is focused on each streamer's collection of fan-favorite TV series, films and characters. The carefully tailored campaign includes a robust blitz across national broadcast, social, digital, and owned-and-operated channels.\n\nThis new partnership puts subscribers first, giving them access to the incredible breadth and depth of three complementary libraries, including some of the greatest franchises like Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Disney's Frozen, The Avengers, Star Wars, and Toy Story and Warner Bros. Discovery's Batman, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. In addition, subscribers can also enjoy an upcoming slate of must-watch premieres, including Only Murders in the Building Season 4 on Hulu (Aug 27), Agatha All Along on Disney+ (Sept 18) and The Penguin on Max (Sept).\n\nRoger's Take: On one hand, this bundle is great for those already with all three streaming services, since you should be able to get them combined to save money and for those that don't have Max, this could be a great way of getting it cheaper. However, it's still a bit of a clunky way of bundling the streaming services together since they aren't really interacting with one another, since you will have to use both the Disney+ and Max apps separately.\n\nWill you be taking up this bundle?

Here are details on each one:\n\nMax Ultimate Ad-Free is not included with either bundle, meaning video quality is limited to HD 1080P.\n\nEach plan also allows for streaming select Hulu content in the Disney Plus app and select HBO content in the Hulu app. This newer feature for Disney Plus bundle subscribers may be expanded to include even more compatibility across the services in the future.

For all three streaming services, it's $16.99/month with ads and $29.99/month without ads - but how much of a deal is that really? If you're looking at ad-supported, then the savings are more than 38% compared to pricing out each streamer individually (Disney+ Basic: $7.99, Hulu with ads: $7.99, Max With Ads: $9.99). On the no-ads side, you're looking at a collective savings of close to 35% compared to individual streamer pricing (Disney+ Premium: $13.99, Hulu no-ads: $17.99, Max Ad-Free: $16.99). And just to make sure folks know that everyone is just one big happy family moving forward, you can expect to see a huge PR/marketing push for the bundle - beginning with the promo above.\n\n\"On the heels of the very successful launch of Hulu on Disney+, this new bundle with Max will offer subscribers even more choice and value,\" shared Joe Earley, President, Direct to Consumer, Disney Entertainment, when the news was first announced back in May of this year. \"This incredible new partnership puts subscribers first, giving them access to blockbuster films, originals, and three massive libraries featuring the very best brands and entertainment in streaming today.\" JB Perrette, CEO and President, Global Streaming and Games, Warner Bros. Discovery, added, \"This new offering delivers for consumers the greatest collection of entertainment for the best value in streaming and will help drive incremental subscribers and much stronger retention. Offering this unprecedented entertainment value for fans across all the complimentary genres these three services offer presents a powerful new roadmap for the future of the industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ray_flook@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Ray Flook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Here's How to Make the Most of It", "body": "Matt is The Streamable's News Editor and resident Ohio State fan. You can find him covering everything from breaking news to streaming comparisons to sporting events. Matt is extremely well-rounded, having worked for the Big Ten Conference, BroadwayWorld, True Crime Obsessed, and Land-Grant Holy Land before joining TS. He cut the cord in 2014, streams with a Fire TV, and his favorite titles include \"The Bear,\" \"The Great British Bake Off,\" \"Mrs. Davis,\" and anything on the Hallmark Channel.\n\nAs media companies continue to search for ways to remain profitable as cord-cutting continues to wreak havoc on their previously time-tested revenue models, one of the ways that many believe they will be able to combat the tides of consumer cost-cutting is via bundles. The details of the newest inter-streamer bundle were released on Thursday as Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are uniting Disney+, Hulu, and Max into a single bundle for $16.99 or $29.99 per month, what the companies tout as a 38% discount over subscribing to each individually. However, as with all marketing materials, if you look at the particulars a little more closely, it might not actually be that good of a deal.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, the Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle does still provide savings, but in a world in which the Disney Bundle has been the focal point of the House of Mouse's streaming strategy for well over a year, comparing this new bundle's price with subscribing to each service individually feels a tad disingenuous.\n\nNew customers coming to Disney+ are greeted with opportunities to add Hulu on practically every screen, and the same is true for new Hulu subscribers. Disney's goal has been to make the various interactions of the Disney Bundle too good to pass up. So, if someone was going to sign up for either ad-supported Disney+ or Hulu on their own at $7.99 per month, the chances seem pretty good that they would opt to pay $2 more monthly for the Duo Basic ad-supported Disney Bundle tier for $9.99 per month.\n\nSo, if we use that as the baseline for the ad-supported plan on the new bundle with Max, it's looking like less of a slam-dunk deal, and more like a decent, but moderate savings. The ad-supported level of WBD's flagship streamer also costs $9.99 monthly, meaning that if you had all three streamers before this bundle, you were paying $19.98 every month.\n\nTherefore, the $2.99 monthly savings that the Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle offers is nothing to sneeze at, but it is closer to 15% savings than it is 38%. For a full year subscribed to both, the savings would be $35.88.\n\nHowever, the interesting quirk in this new bundle announcement is that it seems to be bucking a recent trend in streaming. Due to the fact that entertainment companies have been able to generate more revenue from ad-supported plans than ad-free (thanks to being able to earn on subscription costs and ad sales), they have been not so slowly, but definitely surely making it less and less attractive to pay to go ad-free. But that does not appear to be the case here.\n\nAgain going back to the existing Disney Bundle for comparison purposes; the company's Duo Premium provides Disney+ and Hulu ad-free. That bundle costs $19.99 per month. On the WBD side, Max's Ad-Free plan runs $16.99 monthly, bringing the price for the two plans to $36.98 -- if you legitimately signed up for each individually, you would pay $48.97. The corresponding ad-free plan on the Disney-WBD bundle costs $29.99 (exactly what The Streamable's expert David Satin predicted in May), meaning that customers will save $6.99 every month (or $83.88 if they remain subscribed for a full year). That savings comes out to just about 19%, less than half of what Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are promoting.\n\nNonetheless, the ad-free deal is notably better, both in terms of percentage and actual dollars. While that might be easily explained as a weird happenstance of how the bundles are constructed, companies like Disney and WBD rarely make moves of this nature without some overarching strategy. Therefore, if they want to push people toward the more expensive ad-free tier, perhaps they are seeing declines on the ad-sales front, making it less profitable to push the ad-supported plans.\n\nOf course, cost is not the only benefit of streaming bundles. Combining subscriptions for multiple streaming services into a single bill and profile makes managing your accounts much easier. While one of the major benefits of streaming is being able to cancel (and resubscribe) to services at any time, having to bounce back and forth between services, remember different emails and passwords, and keep up with individual billing cycles can be increasingly frustrating when you are simply trying to manage your spending habits. Bundles like this one eliminate a significant portion of that headache by putting everything you need to cancel, upgrade, or downgrade your subscription into one convenient location.\n\nSo, if you are looking to sign up for the new Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle and want to get the best bang for your buck, then -- in this increasingly rare occasion -- you will get the best deal by choosing the ad-free option.", "source": {"uri": "thestreamable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Streamable"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_tamanini@thestreamable.com", "name": "Matt Tamanini", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

New streaming bundle just dropped. Like a cursed capitalist hydra, Disney+, Max, and Hulu have emerged from the seas of commerce as one with the launch of their highly touted new streaming bundle. It's hard to resist the siren call of convenience - three services for one monthly charge! - but is the latest streaming bundle worth it? The short answer (unfortunately, for those of us wondering if David Zaslav has a yacht the orcas can overturn) is: Yes.\n\nThe new Disney+, Max, and Hulu streaming bundle officially went live today and is now available with either an ad-supported or ad-free plan. The cheaper ad-supported bundle costs $16.99/month, while the ad-free tier will run you $29.99/month. That still might sound a little pricey, but the announcement promises \"a savings of up to 38%\" for new and existing subscribers - a number so specific it must be true! And it is, surprisingly.\n\nRelated 33 Best Sci-Fi Movies on Max to Watch Right Now\n\nIf your thing is traveling beyond the stars, have we got a treat for you. These are the best sci-fi films you can stream on Max today.\n\nShould You Get the New Disney+, Max, and Hulu Streaming Bundle?\n\nOnly you know what's best for your finances, of course (taxes: bad; little treats: good), but the new streaming bundle is pretty enticing, even if it doesn't fix all those pesky UI problems. The most important thing to note is that the ad-supported bundle of all three services costs as much as the ad-free Max subscription tier. The ad-free Hulu plan is $17.99/month, while a Hulu and Disney bundle costs $19.99/month. I'll spare you the boring math, but basically the equation works out to about $10/month for each service when you get the super-mega-corporate ad-free bundle.\n\nExisting subscribers will need to do a little legwork to consolidate their plans, depending on how and where you subscribe, but the payoff does appear to be worth it. Unlike the Netflix, Peacock, and AppleTV+ \"StreamSaver\" plan (all the money in the world and that's the name you came up with?), which is only available for Xfinity customers and something called Venu (Google says it's a sports thing), the new Warner Bros. and Disney bundle is available to all subscribers, and not just certain consumers.\n\nIt also seems, according to the FAQs, that subscribers will continue to enjoy accessing all three apps separately, unless you're one of those freaks who actually likes browsing Hulu titles on the Disney+ app because it is kind of hilarious to see The First Omen next to Bluey. The only real catch here is that Max's ultimate ad-free plan - which allows subscribers to stream on four devices at once and includes access to select titles in 4K UHD, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR 10 - is not included in the new Capitalist Voltron bundle.\n\nJust last week, we learned that Disney+ is implementing new changes to the streaming app in an effort to keep viewers hooked for longer, including an improved recommendation algorithm and live channels dedicated to streaming various franchise movies and shows (i.e., Marvel) 24/7.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Zaslav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syfy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluey_(2018_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bluey (2018 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omen_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Omen (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Atmos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolby Atmos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/disney-plus-hulu-and-max-bundle.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763000", "eventUri": "eng-9763000", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

There's Plenty of Music, But That's Not The Killer Feature\n\nStreaming services are perpetually unprofitable. So, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are taking a page from cable television. Instead of pitting Disney+, Hulu, and Max against each other, they will offer all three of these services in an affordable bundle.\n\nThe Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle comes in both ad-supported and ad-free varieties. If you're willing to deal with ads, you'll pay just $17 a month for these services ($10 in monthly savings). Opting for an ad-free experience pushes the price to $30 a month ($20 in monthly savings).\n\nBoth membership tiers provide full access to the Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming libraries. This includes Max's live MLB and NBA coverage. That said, the new bundle doesn't include Hulu with Live TV or Max Ultimate.\n\nThis is one of the most significant corporate partnerships of the streaming era. Competitors rarely bundle their streaming services together, and such bundles are usually distributed through cellular providers or ISPs. Disney's decision to place its streaming services alongside Max should be seen as an admission of failure -- standalone streaming ventures are historically unprofitable, so consolidation is the only way forward.\n\nStreaming bundles, like cable bundles, provide stability and mutual benefit for participating media corporations. Consumers are approximately 16% less likely to cancel a bundled subscription. And if one service that's included in a bundle (let's say Max) has a hit show, all the services that are bundled with it (Disney+ and Hulu) will gain new subscribers.\n\nOf course, there are still some major differences between streaming bundles and cable bundles. You won't face a massive cancelation fee when leaving a streaming bundle, for example. And while cable companies are often criticized for bundling popular channels with dozens of useless filler channels (which artificially inflate the price of your cable plan), streaming bundles are comparatively lean.\n\nNote that Disney and WBD are also working to develop a joint sports streaming platform with FOX. This streaming venture has already elicited an antitrust suit from Fubo, which alleges that legacy corporations have intentionally stifled competition in the sports media market.\n\nThe new Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle is available in the U.S. with prices starting at $17 a month. Customers who want an ad-free experience will pay $30 a month.\n\nSource: The Walt Disney Company", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_heinzman@howtogeek.com", "name": "Andrew Heinzman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery announced a rare team-up of two rival entertainment companies. They revealed it would offer a bundle of Disney's Hulu and Disney+ streaming services with Warner Bros. Discovery's Max service. Today, that bundle is officially live and offers solid savings for people who want all three services. At the moment, this bundle is only being offered for US residents.\n\nIn Disney's press release, it stated that all three of the services' websites are now offering the new bundle. The price for the ad-based bundle for all three services is $16.99 a month, which is over 38 percent off compared to getting the services on their own. You can also get an ad-free bundle for all services for $29.99 a month, which is nearly 35 percent off compared to buying each service separately.\n\nThere are a few small limitations to this deal, aside from its US exclusivity. Currently, users cannot sign up for an annual subscription to the bundle. You also can't get the bundle with Hulu's Live TV option. Most notably, the ad-free version of the bundle does not include an option to add Max's Ultimate plan, which offers access to 4K streaming of supported movies and shows.\n\nThe new bundle comes at a time where streaming companies are all chasing after one premium service: Netflix. Last week, the company announced that during the second quarter of 2024, it added over 8 million new subscribers worldwide.\n\nDisney and Warner Bros. Discovery clearly hope that offering all three services at once for a lower price could raise subscriber numbers for all three services, and also showcase its deep library of exclusive and classic content.

Additionally, paying for all the services that include your favorite shows or movies becomes more expensive. However, a new bundle that offers all the content from Disney+, Hulu, and Max has arrived to make things easier for you.\n\nDisney Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery announced an agreement to offer a bundle that will help users save while accessing a wide library of premium content. For some time now, streaming services have been increasing prices. So, if some of the content you like is only available on a particular platform, your monthly bill will grow exponentially. The situation has forced several users to discard some (or most) of their subscriptions.\n\nThat said, the new bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu, and Max seems like an excellent deal for those fans of the content of these platforms. Max is home to many of the best classic and modern shows, such as House of the Dragon. On the other hand, Disney streaming platforms include many classic movies and series (including Pixar content), documentaries, and more.\n\nThe bundle is available in the US in two tiers: ad-free ($30) and with ads ($17). In comparison, paying for all the included platforms separately would cost you a total of $36. So, the price of the ad-free bundle will help you save 16% on your monthly bill. You can also save even more if you don't mind seeing ads from time to time.\n\nIt seems that streaming platforms are resorting to the \"bundles\" strategy to try to attract more users. Verizon customers can pay for one that includes Max and Netflix subscriptions. On the other hand, Comcast customers have the option of paying for a bundle that includes subscriptions to Peacock, Apple TV+, and Netflix. However, the new Disney + Warner bundle has the advantage of being available to everyone without forcing you to be a client of any particular ISP or mobile carrier.", "source": {"uri": "androidheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jean_leon@androidheadlines.com", "name": "Jean Leon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery announced they were officially joining forces to offer a revolutionary new bundle combining their three popular streaming services into a single package.\n\nWhile our initial reaction was that this idea hearkens back to the days of cable channel bundling, it's not entirely a bad idea as long as no one is being forced into it -- and it promised to offer some substantial savings for folks who subscribe to both.\n\nIn other words, while Disney fans are still more than welcome to subscribe to Disney+ on its own (or with ESPN+ and Hulu in any of the House of Mouse's own bundles), those who are also interested in the service formerly known as HBO Max can add it to the mix for less. The reverse is also true for Max fans who are considering -- or are already paying for -- Disney+.\n\nThe only thing missing from the May announcement by the streaming giants was an actual price tag. Executives called it a \"first of its kind\" offering and hinted that the deal would be compelling.\n\nNow, the bundle has arrived in the US, and there are enough savings here that even Disney folks who were on the fence about Max may be tempted to jump in since you're effectively getting three services for the price of two -- although that arguably depends on which two you pick.\n\nBilling it as \"The ultimate bundle for an unbeatable price,\" the new package, dubbed simply the \"Disney+, Hulu, Max Bundle,\" starts at $16.99 for the ad-supported versions of all three services -- a savings of just under $9 per month compared to signing up for them separately, which works out to $25.97 -- if anyone actually did that.\n\nYou see, there's a small catch here that Disney and Warner Bros. aren't talking about. While Disney+ and Hulu each cost $7.99 per month on their own ($15.98 monthly), it's hard to imagine anybody who watches both is paying for them separately since Disney already offers a Duo Basic plan that bundles them for $9.99 per month. With ad-supported Max going for $9.99 monthly on its own, the real-world cost of having all three services is $19.98 per month, so, technically, you're only saving around $3. Still, three bucks is three bucks.\n\nThe deal is only slightly better if you want to opt for an ad-free experience across the board. The new bundle is $29.99 per month, which sounds like a great deal compared to the $48.97 you'd theoretically pay for all three services on their own, but again, Disney's Duo Premium already puts the $13.99 Disney+ and $17.99 Hulu plans together for only $19.99. Stack the $16.99 ad-free Max on top of that, and the fair price comparison is $29.99 versus $36.98 for a savings of $7 rather than $19.\n\nThere are also a few details that Disney isn't sharing that may give you pause until they're sorted out. When The Verge asked Disney for additional information, \"such as the streaming quality and number of simultaneous viewers that are supported for each tier,\" the company refused to answer on the record.\n\nIt's a safe bet that you'll get the features specific to the tier included in the bundle, which for Max means the standard ad-free plan rather than the \"Ultimate Ad-Free.\" In other words, expect 1080p streaming on two devices simultaneously, as opposed to 4K UHD on up to four screens. However, the situation with Disney+ is a bit murkier; since the Basic and Premium plans offered in the US both provide 4K UHD streaming, we're hoping the bundled version will be the same. Disney also offers a \"Standard\" plan in Canada, the UK, and Europe that's limited to 1080p, but it's not available in the US.", "source": {"uri": "idropnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iDrop News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery considers split, NBCUniversal wraps upfront and more\n\nAs major streamers continue to combine sales efforts by packaging themselves into singular subscriptions a la the traditional pay-TV bundle, Netflix has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to streaming's bundle bonanza. The company is not keen on combining sales efforts strictly with other streaming services like in the case of Disney's and Warner Bros. Discovery's Disney+-Hulu-Max bundle.\n\n\"We haven't bundled Netflix solely with other streamers like Disney+ or Max because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination for entertainment thanks to the breadth and variety of our slate and superior product experience. This has driven industry leading penetration, engagement and retention for us, which limits the benefit to Netflix of bundling directly with other streamers,\" Netflix wrote in a letter to shareholders released on July 18.\n\nWith that said, Netflix has put itself into bundles with other streamers. For example, Comcast's StreamSaver bundle includes Netflix's ad-supported tier as well as Apple TV+ and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal's Peacock. And just last week, Verizon introduced a bundle of sorts by offering a free year of Netflix's ad-free tier to annual subscribers of Peacock's ad-supported tier.\n\nBut there are three important callouts when it comes to Netflix's participation in those two bundles. First, they are centered around aggregators -- Comcast and Verizon -- selling the subscriptions to those companies' existing customers. Second, the Comcast bundle sells access to Netflix's ad-supported tier. And third, the Verizon bundle only offers one year of access to Netflix's ad-free tier.\n\n\"By Netflix being a part of the [Comcast] bundle, it will expose Netflix to [Comcast] customers that may not subscribe to Netflix without that. And what that does is simply increase the share for Netflix,\" said Mike Proulx, vp and research director at research firm Forrester.\n\nBy contrast, Netflix abstaining from Disney-WBD-style bundles appears to be the company's way of ensuring the bundles provide incremental subscriber increases -- or, put another way, of making sure the bundles don't cut into its existing subscriber base.\n\nAs subscription research firm Antenna noted in its \"State of Subscriptions\" report released in June, Netflix \"should carefully scrutinize potential bundle offerings.\" The reason being that Netflix has a higher share of longstanding subscribers versus new or previously churned subscribers compared to other streamers.\n\nIn other words, Netflix may be more at risk than other streaming services of bundles cutting into its profit margins. Given that the whole point of a bundle is to give subscribers more for their money, a streaming service like Netflix likely stands to make less money per bundled subscriber than per a direct subscriber.\n\nWhich helps to explain why Netflix would only make its ad-free service available to Verizon's bundled subscribers for a year: The lower per-subscriber revenue could be accounted for as subscriber acquisition costs (assuming enough of these subscribers graduate to direct subscribers after the initial year).\n\nBut then, the Comcast bundle isn't a limited-time offer. Nor is it for Netflx's ad-free tier. It's for the ad-supported tier and for good reason. For starters, Netflix could use the help, considering it doesn't expect to reach \"critical ad subscriber scale\" until next year. But perhaps more notably, advertising raises the per-subscriber revenue cap to potentially more than offset any downward margin pressures.\n\nAnd so, yeah the bundle is back. But Netflix's approach indicates that the bundle's primary value is narrower than being a means of acquiring subscribers, full stop. That's true in the near term. But in the long term -- and as has long been the case for the traditional TV bundle and its value to cable TV networks -- the bundle's big benefit is providing a stable pipeline of ad-supported subscribers that streamers can mine for revenue to the depths of advertisers' pockets.\n\n\"I don't feel like we have enough insight to know what the right price tag is for any of those kind of deals, and I don't think anyone does.\"\n\nNetflix has leapfrogged two TV network owners -- Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery -- to rank as the fourth most-watched media company in terms of TV watch time, according to Nielsen's The Media Distributor Gauge report for June 2024.\n\nAside from Netflix's ascendance, the rankings remained in line with the previous month's report. Disney retained its overall lead, with YouTube maintaining the No. 2 spot, though the gap between the two did close to less than a percentage point.\n\n278 million: Number of paid subscribers that Netflix had as of the second quarter of 2024.\n\n-500,000: Number of subscribers that NBCUniversal's Peacock lost during Q2 2024.\n\n>50 million: Number of global monthly active users that TelevisaUnivision's streaming service ViX had, as of Q2 2024.\n\n$2.2 billion: How much TV network and streaming service owners will pay over 11 years to air WNBA games.\n\n30: Number of employees that Fox Entertainment is laying off.\n\n-3.73%: Percentage year-over-year decline in TV ad impressions in the first half of 2024.\n\nWhat Naylor's exit from Netflix means for streaming overall:\n\nRead more about Netflix here.\n\nHow Revolut's creator strategy is benefitting from YouTube's long-form swing:\n\nThe Comcast-owned conglomerate has wrapped its upfront negotiations for the year and claimed an increase in the amount of money advertisers and agencies committed, according to Variety.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery weighs going separate ways:\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery may become Warner Bros. and Discovery, with the company considering splitting its studio and streaming business into one company and its TV network business into another, according to the Financial Times.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's last-ditch NBA bid:\n\nTNT's parent company (for now at least) has decided to exercise its matching rights to nab NBA games away from Amazon, though the league may not agree to WBD's proposal, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNetflix loses top ad sales exec:\n\nFormer NBCUniversal, Hulu and Snap sales leader Peter Naylor can now add Netflix to his list of former employers, with his departure coming less than a year after Netflix's original ad boss Jeremi Gorman left and was replaced by Amy Reinhard, according to Business Insider.\n\nApple pinches its pocketbook:\n\nThe iPhone maker may be worth more than $3 trillion, but having spent $20 billion-plus on original shows and movies, the company is looking to tighten its budget, according to Bloomberg, which also reported that Apple is interested in licensing more movies from major studios.", "source": {"uri": "digiday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digiday"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_peterson@digiday.com", "name": "Tim Peterson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Last December, Verizon announced a streaming bundle where customers could obtain subscriptions to ad-tiers for both Netflix and Max for $10 per month. In May, Comcast announced a bundle that nets subscribers access to Peacock, Apple TV+, and Netflix for just $14.99 per month.\n\nThis is one of two streaming bundles that Disney and Warner Bros.

On Thursday, July 25, two of the most beloved and enduring entertainment companies in the world have joined forces to offer remarkable savings. After announcing their plans to partner in May, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have made it official, and consumers are now able to bundle Disney+, Hulu, and Max via all three service's websites starting at just $16.99 per month.\n\nAs the streaming industry continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see more and more collaborations of this kind as companies are looking for every advantage to keep customers subscribed. But with this first-of-its-kind bundle, Disney and WBD are hoping that by bringing together three of the most popular streaming services on the market, they can keep their customers engaged enough to make the platforms feel indispensable.\n\nAvailable now, consumers are able to sign up for a bundle of the ad-supported tiers of Disney+, Hulu, and Max for just $16.99 or for the ad-free versions for $29.99. Both of those plans represent a 38% discount over what it would cost if you signed up for each service individually. Hulu normally runs $7.99 or $17.99 for ad-supported and ad-free, while Disney+ is $7.99 and $13.99 and Max is $9.99 or $16.99. The latter service also has an Ultimate Ad-Free tier which runs $20.99 monthly, which is not yet included in this bundle. There is no annual price available for the bundle.\n\nThese totals are almost exactly in line with what The Streamable's David Satin predicted back in May. At the time of the announcement, our expert targeted a $17.99 ad-supported monthly (just $1 off) and a $29.99 ad-free rate, which was exactly right.\n\nFor the first time, this streaming offering brings together the full catalogs of Disney and Warner Bros., meaning that no matter your entertainment persuasion, you have a nearly endless library of options. For one low, monthly price, you are able to bounce back and forth between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Extended Universe. You are able to watch both \"The Bear\" and \"The House of the Dragon.\" You are able to watch \"Dancing With the Stars\" and \"Property Brothers.\" The bundle will bring together the portfolios of some of TV and streaming's biggest brands, including ABC, CNN, DC, Discovery, Disney, Food Network, FX, HBO, HGTV, Hulu, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, Star Wars, Warner Bros., and many more.

Discovery and Disney launch Hulu, Disney+, Max bundle", "body": "Warner Bros. Discovery may not have locked up NBA rights this week - but it has a new bundle with Disney that debuted Thursday.\n\nA bundle of WBD's Max and Disney's Hulu and Disney+ officially launched in the U.S., putting price points to the previously announced trio of services that come together in both ad-supported and ad-free versions. The bundle is priced at $16.99 per month with ads while the ad-free version is $29.99 per month - promising up to 38% savings compared to purchasing the services individually.\n\nOn its own, WBD's Max costs $9.99 per month with ads and $16.99 per month for its lowest-cost ad-free plan (following a $1 price bump last month). Hulu and Disney+ are already offered as a duo bundle from Disney at a price of $9.99 with ads and $19.99 ad-free. Speaking during Q1 earnings about the Disney-WBD bundle, WBD's JB Perrette said the partners were working to price the bundle \"very attractively\" compared to the cost of a standalone Max and the price of the existing Hulu-Disney+ bundle. The new WBD-Disney bundle is about $3 cheaper per month than buying standalone Max and the Hulu-Disney+ combo with ads and about a $7 per month comparative discount for the ad-free bundle.\n\nThe trio bundle - which brings together entertainment brands such as ABC, CNN, DC, Discovery, Disney, Food Network, FX, HBO, HGTV, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, Searchlight, and Warner Bros., among others - is available for purchase direct-to-consumer from any of the three streaming platforms' websites.\n\nThe companies are also launching a concerted, cross-platform national marketing campaign starting today, which features each streamer's collection of popular TV series, films and characters. According to the companies, the campaign includes \"a robust blitz\" of omnichannel marketing including national broadcast, social, digital and O&O channels.\n\nWhen the media companies first disclosed plans to team up together on a bundle of their competing services, WBD executives suggested it's aiming to fulfill consumers viewing needs and has enough breadth of content to be considered a \"must-have\" TV subscription on par with a Netflix or Prime Video.\n\n\"Our bundle plus one or two of those other services... I think can make up the entertainment experience for most consumers very happily,\" Perrette said in May. \"We do think this package can be an anchor tenant of every household's entertainment experience and we don't think there's a need at this point for anything more to it.\"\n\nWBD CEO David Zaslav during Q1 earnings cited modest content overlap among the three services as presenting opportunity for incremental subscriber growth. WBD execs at the time also noted expectations for the bundle to help increase retention and lower churning, in turn supporting higher lifetime value of subscribers, alongside ARPU benefits. And by working together the companies anticipate marketing efficiencies as the bundle gains adoption.\n\nThe companies are also taking a direct-to-consumer route in offering services together, cutting out the middleman, where Zaslav in May noted better ARPU and business benefits of doing it themselves rather than through an aggregator or platform provider.\n\nIt's a different approach to bundling than some, such as Netflix, which in its Q2 earnings letter to shareholders last week explicitly said it hasn't bundled directly with other streamers like Disney+ or Max \"because Netflix already operates as a go-to destination\" due to its wide content slate and product experience. The letter went on to suggest that it's other streamers that need Netflix in a bundle rather than the other way around, where teaming up with competing services has limited benefits for the SVOD giant as it already enjoys high penetration, engagement and retention.\n\nIn the name of making Netflix easy to find and use, it is however, willing to be bundled alongside other streamers in offers provided by operator partners alongside their other services - such as the recent $15 per month StreamSaver bundle of Netflix, Apple TV+ and Peacock from Comcast and an earlier offer of Netflix and Max for $10 per month from Verizon.\n\nBut discounted bundles of streaming services could be attractive as consumers clamp down on their number of services and SVOD spending. According to Parks Associates research, U.S. households that had five or more OTT subscriptions declined from 52% in Q3 2023 to 46% in Q1 2024 and average monthly spending on SVOD services dropped from $73 to $63 during the same period. How much of that spending decline is a result of consumers turning to cheaper or free ad-supported streaming options wasn't immediately clear.\n\nAnd as streamers continue to raise prices and consumers keep an eye on wallets, others have noted the importance of being included in bundles - namely incoming leadership at Paramount as part of a pending acquisition by Skyworks Media.\n\nDuring a call for investors discussing the merger deal, former NBCU exec and incoming president Jeff Shell said the company wants to lead in DTC streaming, where it's exploring all options including partnering with competing services.\n\n\"To be a winner in DTC really means being in the ultimate bundle that's coming,\" Shell said earlier this month, although what shape that eventually takes remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "streamtvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreamTV Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

That's a 53% savings for the popular streaming services. The cost almost doubles for advertising-free versions, though.\n\nThe three are ready to watch on Mac, iPad, iPhone or Apple TV.\n\nThursday's move is part of a recent trend toward bundling. Apple TV+ got on the bandwagon in May, joining in with Netflix and Peacock.\n\nStreaming services have embraced bundles because they reduce churn. Someone might drop a subscription to one service because they don't watch it much, but they are less likely to cancel a bundle with two other services -- they'll have to go through the hassle of subscribing to them separately, possibly at the same price as the original bundle.\n\nDisney+, Hulu and Max announced this spring that they would team up. Starting Thursday, that promise has been fulfilled. They're accepting subscriptions to the bundle now.\n\nThe monthly cost for the services with advertising is $16.99. For comparison, separate advert-supported subscriptions to the three would cost $25.97. And the price rises to $29.99 for the ad-free version of the bundle. The regular ad-free total would be $48.97, so the bundle is a savings of $18.99 or 63%.\n\nDisney+ is the home of all things Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and more.

There are two subscription options: an ad-supported tier at $16.99 per month and an ad-free tier at $29.99 per month. As Max points out, that represents a saving of 38% on the cost of buying the services separately.\n\nThe bundle includes shows and movies from some of the biggest names in entertainment: Disney, of course, but also ABC, CNN, DC, FX, HBO, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, Star Wars, Warner Bros. and more. Imminent new releases that you'll be able to stream include season four of Only Murders in the Building and Max's new Batman spin-off show, The Penguin, which arrives in August and September, respectively.\n\nOf course, you'll also be able to also stream all the best Disney Plus movies, best Hulu movies and best Max movies as well as each streamer's catalog of TV shows. As you'd expect, there's a suitably snazzy promo video, which I've embedded below.\n\nAs we previously reported, this bundle looks very much like the previous future of TV from the pre-streaming days: cable. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, because by bundling services together you get access to much more content without having to spend eye-watering sums of money - provided, of course, that the bundle contains services that you actually want.\n\nIn this particular case, the best streaming services being bundled together are all known for their quality, and the prices aren't as high as we might have feared. When you add together the cost of a Disney Plus subscription ($13.99 per month for Premium), a Hulu subscription ($17.99 without ads) and a Max subscription ($19.99 for Ultimate), you're looking at just shy of $52 per month. So this new bundle is priced pretty aggressively.\n\nThe elephant in the room here is of course Netflix, which for many people is the one subscription service they can't do without. The streamer has outright said that it won't take part in any cash-saving bundles outside of two it's already apart of with network providers. As a result, other streamers are finding it hard to dent Netflix's market share and to reduce churn, which is when subscribers cancel their subs. Bundling can potentially have a positive effect on both, so Netflix shouldn't be surprised when other streamers get the bundling bug too and it's up against a bigger list of rivals that have licensed its content already.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carrie_marshall@techradar.com", "name": "Carrie Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Searchlight Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promo_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promo (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churn rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQHURnkee5ckR9rfDyTAX5-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763000", "eventUri": "eng-9763000", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The add-on package gives viewers access to live sporting events, including NHL, MLB, NBA and NCAA games airing on TNT, TBS and TruTV.\n\nHow Much Does Max Cost?\n\nWith Max, there are three tiers to choose from (along with the new bundles):", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Marvel_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ms. Marvel (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T'Challa_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WandaVision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dropout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dropout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Elementary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbott Elementary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-07/Untitled%20design%20%2823%29.jpg?h=d1cb525d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763000", "eventUri": "eng-9763000", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 368}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The service also offers an ultimate ad-free plan for $20.99 per month, which includes the ability to stream on four devices at once in 4K UHD, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and HDR.

You still get access to all of the content from the three streamers. You also get a bunch of ads. This is likely the most budget-friendly way to get your eyeballs on Game of Thrones and Star Wars content.\n\nSpeaking of, Disney+ is the home to all things Star Wars, including The Acolyte, which has proven to be a pretty big hit for the platform and . The platform is also Marvel HQ, with Agatha All Along and that new Daredevil show premiering in the near future.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Disney+ would be well-served by developing some decent shows outside of its two tentpole franchises, but that's where Hulu comes in. This streamer is home to a little global phenomenon called The Bear, in addition to the cringefest Pen15, and much more. Hulu also streams TV shows the day after they air from networks like FX and ABC. That means you can use it to watch both Sh\u014dgun and Abbott Elementary.\n\nAs for Max, you know the drill. It's HBO that for some reason has been nobody quite understands. That means access to the iconic cable network's entire catalog, including The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wire and so much more.

For $16.99, you can watch Disney+, Hulu, and Max content with some advertising interruptions. That would normally cost you $25.97 if subscribing to all three services individually ($9.99 for Max, and $7.99 each for Disney+ and Hulu).\n\nIf you don't want to deal with ads, you can choose the more expensive \"No Ads\" bundle, which will cost you $29.99 per month. While that certainly isn't \"cheap,\" it is $18.98 cheaper than subscribing to the add-free plans individually, which totals $48.97. ($16.99 for Max, $17.99 for Max, $13.99 for Disney+). This plan also supports downloads, which the \"With Ads\" plan does not, surprisingly.\n\nOn the surface, these aren't terrible deals: If you want to watch content from all three of these services each month, either plan will be less expensive than keeping individual subscriptions going. But there are two caveats here to consider.\n\nMax probably won't stream in 4K\n\nAs reported by The Verge, Disney is being cagey about the video quality of the streams under these specific bundles. The company won't disclose streaming resolutions on the record, which leads The Verge to suspect that the plans will be capped at the resolutions you'd expect for With Ads and basic ad-free services. While that won't be a surprise for With Ads, it's a bummer for Max, whose base ad-free plan only offers 1080p streaming. You normally need to subscribe to the more expensive ad-free plan to access 4K streaming, which doesn't seem to be the plan offered here. If you want to watch shows like House of the Dragon in crispy 4K resolution, you'll need to subscribe to Max individually for $20.99 per month. Yikes.\n\nBundling your streaming services limits your freedom\n\nWhile streaming has changed a lot since its introduction to the market (in many ways for the worse) one major benefit has always remained: You can cancel anytime you want. You can subscribe to Netflix to watch the latest season of Bridgerton, then cancel it immediately after. You have to pay for the month, so you can watch whatever else you want, but after 30 days, you're free -- at least, until you subscribe to watch Bridgerton's next season.\n\nWhen you tie yourself to a bundle, however, you limit your freedom to jump around plans each month. Sure, you can cancel your bundle whenever you want, but you'll have to cut all three services at once. If you find you're not watching enough Disney+, too bad: In order to get rid of one of these services, you have to cancel them all.\n\nSo, bundling really makes sense when you know you're going to watch these services all the time. That's not a farfetched idea: All three have a backlog of excellent shows and movies to watch, as well as a regular stream of new content. But if you know you only sign into streaming services to watch one or two particular shows as they come out, bundling might not be the move.\n\nInterested in subscribing to one or all of these services?

At one point, over a hundred million households paid for bundled CSTV. The bills slowly went up and up and up, even as the hourly ads increased to insane levels -- sometimes 20 minutes per hour. Then one day you wake up and realize you are paying $150 a month to watch four or five networks.\n\nWhether it's streaming or CSTV, bundling is affirmative action for left-wing Hollywood, a way to convince you to pay for a whole lot of content you never watch, which in turn subsidizes content openly hostile to you (CNN, MTV, Comedy Central, etc.).\n\nAt least with streaming, you have a choice. CSTV was a monopoly. You had a handful of providers who all offered you the same lousy choices of overpriced channel packages. No CSTV customer was ever allowed to pay only for the networks watched. You had to pay for dozens of channels you never watched to get the ones you did. People who fall for these streaming bundles are even more gullible.\n\nInstead of paying $17 for three services, why not subscribe to one for a month? The following month you subscribe to another. And so on... You couldn't do that with CSTV. You can, at least for now, with these streamers. If you insist on giving money to people who hate you and who want to sexually groom your kids, at least be smart about it.\n\nHere's what the future of bundled streaming looks like:\n\nWhile the news of the bundle earlier this year made waves, the combined offering falls short of the bolder transformation anticipated by many industry veterans and consumers. Subscribers to the bundle, at least for now, will save money but still will need to visit different apps in order to access the programming. Years down the line, many observers believe, the experience of streaming will need to reduce a lot more of the friction that currently exists in order to unlock greater financial returns for media companies.\n\nThat reads to me like something that will become another big, expensive blob, just like the CSTV package that costs $175 per month just so you can watch Fox News.\n\nHere's a little secret...\n\nIf customers resist these streaming bundles, the product might improve. The reason everything is woke and gay now is because CSTV ensures Hollywood doesn't have to please the customers. Whether or not you watch, you pay for the content anyway. If the bundle moves to streaming, you can expect more of the same. But if you resist the streaming bundle, each of these streaming outlets will have to attract and retain enough customers to stay alive. That means delivering a product people actually want to watch.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/05/starwarsfair1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763000", "eventUri": "eng-9763000", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

CSTV was a monopoly. You had a handful of providers who all offered you the same lousy choices of overpriced channel packages. No CSTV customer was ever allowed to pay only for the networks watched. You had to pay for dozens of channels you never watched to get the ones you did. People who fall for these streaming bundles are even more gullible.\n\nInstead of paying $17 for three services, why not subscribe to one for a month? The following month you subscribe to another. And so on... You couldn't do that with CSTV. You can, at least for now, with these streamers. If you insist on giving money to people who hate you and who want to sexually groom your kids, at least be smart about it.\n\nWhile the news of the bundle earlier this year made waves, the combined offering falls short of the bolder transformation anticipated by many industry veterans and consumers. Subscribers to the bundle, at least for now, will save money but still will need to visit different apps in order to access the programming. Years down the line, many observers believe, the experience of streaming will need to reduce a lot more of the friction that currently exists in order to unlock greater financial returns for media companies.\n\nThat reads to me like something that will become another big, expensive blob, just like the CSTV package that costs $175 per month just so you can watch Fox News.\n\nHere's a little secret...\n\nIf customers resist these streaming bundles, the product might improve. The reason everything is woke and gay now is because CSTV ensures Hollywood doesn't have to please the customers. Whether or not you watch, you pay for the content anyway. If the bundle moves to streaming, you can expect more of the same. But if you resist the streaming bundle, each of these streaming outlets will have to attract and retain enough customers to stay alive. That means delivering a product people actually want to watch.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nolte-Here-Come-the-Streaming-Bundles -- Dont-Fall-for-It.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763000", "eventUri": "eng-9763000", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The bundle is available to new and existing subscribers, though some consumers may need to cancel billing on individual streamers separately.\n\nIt appears to be the first bundling deal forged directly between two major streamers that are owned by different companies and not brokered through a third party.\n\nDisney and WBD did not indicate how revenue will be split between the two companies.\n\nDisney, which owns 80% of ESPN, and WBD are also part of a joint venture between the two companies and Fox Corp. called Venu Sports, which will bundle the linear feeds of ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, SECN, ACCN, ABC, Fox, FS1, FS2, BTN, TNT, TBS and truTV into a single streamer. Venu launches later in 2024.\n\nNetflix is bundled with Max through Verizon's myHome and myPlan feature that lets users add streaming and other subscription services to their broadband or mobile plan for a discounted monthly rate. Verizon's offering requires users to get both Netflix and Max and is not a direct partnership between the streamers. Instead, Verizon is acting a bit like a wholesaler of the two services and opting to sell them together for a single price.\n\nAnother Verizon offering gives users a free year of Netflix with a Peacock subscription. A separate add-on includes Apple TV+ through an Apple One membership, while Paramount+ is available via a Walmart+ plan.\n\nAmazon Prime Video allows users to subscribe to additional streamers through its \"channels\" offering. Comcast bundles Netflix, Peacock and Apple TV+ for eligible Xfinity subscribers.\n\nThe new Disney-WBD bundle brings the three popular streaming services together all through a single monthly subscription while providing a wide selection of content from the biggest and most beloved portfolio of brands in entertainment including ABC, CNN, DC, Discovery, Disney, Food Network, FX, HBO, HGTV, Hulu, Marvel, Pixar, Searchlight, Star Wars, Warner Bros. and many more.\n\nBundling has become a popular offering among streamers and other subscription-based services as a way to both boost revenue

{"id": 243230086, "title": "BeyonCa to establish the first \u2018Made in Hong Kong\u2019 car brand with smart electric vehicle", "text": "BeyonCa, a Chinese premium electric vehicle (EV) start-up, said it will build a factory and establish its global headquarters in Hong Kong as it looks to tap the strong automotive supply-chain and rich international talent pool in the Greater Bay Area and gain a foothold in the industry. It plans to set up a production line and four major centres for research and marketing at the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP)\u2019s advanced manufacturing site at Tseung Kwan O, according to Soh Weiming, founder and chairman of BeyonCa. The company, backed by French carmaker Renault, envisions building itself into a \u201cMade in Hong Kong\u201d brand while creating an EV ecosystem that encompasses design, innovation, production, and marketing, Soh said. \u201cThe approach is not about building what and where,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday. \u201cIn my view, it is about building a brand. Brand is a combination of culture, art, history and technology.\u201d He said that it would take several months to finalise the plans for the construction and staffing of the assembly plant. The government-owned HKSTP provides facilities, office space and support for technology companies. BeyonCa, founded in 2021 by Soh, who had previously served at Volkswagen\u2019s China operation for 16 years, aims to develop electric cars to take on the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz in the luxury segment. Dirk van Braeckel, who has 40 years of automotive design experience and was behind several of Volkswagen\u2019s models, now serves as chief design officer at BeyonCa. The EV start-up expects to launch its first production model \u2013 an electric sedan \u2013 by the end of 2025, Soh said. In October 2022, BeyonCa launched its first prototype model, the GT Opus 1. Its artificial intelligence-powered smart cockpit features the world\u2019s first in-cabin, real-time monitoring of blood pressure and an online \u201ccloud doctor\u201d service. It automatically intervenes by slowing down or stopping the car if the driver shows signs of cardiovascular disease, a stroke or fatigue. \u201cOur focus is building good cars and good AI systems,\u201d Soh said. \u201cWe are not going for volume. We are going for positioning and branding.\u201d Aside from the new assembly line, the other three main production processes \u2013 stamping, body welding and painting \u2013 will be conducted at BeyonCa\u2019s mainland production bases, Soh said. Both left-hand drive and right-hand drive models will be assembled at the Hong Kong plant. BeyonCa will target China and Europe, the two key markets for premium EVs, according to Soh, who is also chairman and CEO of Renault\u2019s China operations. BeyonCa\u2019s investors also include Chinese state-owned carmaker Dongfeng Motor. Hong Kong enjoys an advantage over mainland cities because locally built cars are immune to the punitive measures faced by Chinese EV makers. BeyonCa signed a preliminary investment deal with Riyadh-based AI Faisaliah Group last October to jointly explore opportunities for EV development in the Middle East. Cutthroat competition on the mainland is currently ensnaring nearly all EV players in a price war. It was sparked in February, when BYD, the world\u2019s largest EV assembler, slashed the prices of nearly all of its cars by 5 to 20 per cent. Since then, the prices of 50 models across a range of brands have dropped by 10 per cent on average, according to Goldman Sachs.

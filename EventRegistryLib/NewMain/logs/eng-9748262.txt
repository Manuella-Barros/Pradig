filling Soldier Field with fans to cheer on the hometown Chicago Fire, it does recognize that a player of Inter Miami star forward Lionel Messi's caliber always helps to draw a larger crowd and attract new fans to the beautiful game,' the Fire said in a statement.\n\n\"Despite the injury Messi sustained during Sunday's Copa America final, the Fire are confident that he will be back on the pitch for next month's matchup.\n\n\"To ensure a full stadium and to create an unforgettable experience for all in attendance, the Fire are offering the Fan-First Credit Guarantee.\"\n\nShould Messi be \"unavailable\" for the match, single-game ticket buyers from now until match day will be offered $250 off two or more Fire season tickets or $100 off two or more single-match tickets for Inter's 2025 visit to Chicago.\n\nThose who has already bought tickets for the match, including season-ticket purchasers, can claim two complimentary tickets to the Fire's October 19 home match against Nashville is Messi is unavailable.\n\nThe Fire have scheduled special entertainment for the Miami match, including a post-match concert by singer Jason Derulo.\n\njs/nr", "source": {"uri":

Final.\n\nIn the 64th minute of Argentina's 1-0 victory over Colombia, Messi fell to the ground while chasing down Luis Diaz, who carried the ball.\n\nOn Tuesday, Inter Miami released a statement regarding Messi's status but did not offer details about a potential timeline back to the pitch.\n\n\"The captain's availability will be determined by periodic assessments and the progress of his recovery,\" the team said.\n\nA day after the message from the front office, Messi was seen on Miami's bench in its 3-1 win over Toronto.\n\nFor some Fire fans, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu fills the air.\n\nLast year, the club sold 61,000 tickets -- a team record -- for its home game against Miami, reported by The Guardian.\n\nHowever, when Messi didn't play, the Fire presented season-ticket holders with $250 credit toward the following season alongside $50 credit for single-game viewers who decided not to attend.\n\nOther teams in MLS followed suit.\n\nIn May, the Vancouver Whitecaps made stadium concessions half-off to raise morale after Messi, Sergio Busquets and Luis Su\u00e1rez didn't travel.\n\nIf the two-game timeline accurately matches up with Messi's availability, fans would be able to see him back out on the pitch at two Leagues Cup matches on July 27 and Aug. 3.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

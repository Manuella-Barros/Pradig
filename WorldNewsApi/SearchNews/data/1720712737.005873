The Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Governor Dikko Radda, Ibrahim Kaula, announced this in a statement on Sunday in Katsina. According to him, the figure indicated a 227 per cent increase compared to the N1.79 billion generated during the same period in 2023. He attributed the feat to the administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to plugging leakages in the state\u2019s financial system. Mr Kaula added that Mr Radda\u2019s administration had strategically positioned the state to not only exceed its current capacity but also to shatter revenue projections. \u201cEstimates indicate that the state is poised to surpass the N20 billion mark in internal revenue generation for the year 2024. \u201cA feat that seemed unimaginable in previous years when the range hovered between N10 billion and N14 billion,\u201d he said. Mr Kaula added that at the heart of this financial renaissance lies Mr Radda\u2019s visionary \u2018Building Your Future\u2019 policy document, a blueprint that had paved the way for groundbreaking initiatives. He listed the initiatives to include the State Treasury Single Account (TSA) and the recently implemented E-tax billing system. \u201cThese reforms have not only streamlined tax and revenue collections but have also fostered an inclusive environment, ensuring that no stone is left unturned in the quest for economic growth. \u201cOne of the key catalysts for this extraordinary success has been the administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to plugging leakages in the state\u2019s financial system. \u201cBy identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities, Gov. Radda\u2019s team has effectively stemmed the tide of revenue loss, paving the way for an unprecedented influx of resources,\u201d he said. According to the CPS, Mr Radda\u2019s overarching objective is to empower the state to achieve fiscal self-sufficiency. This will enable it to offset its monthly and annual wage bills solely through internally generated revenue by the year 2027.

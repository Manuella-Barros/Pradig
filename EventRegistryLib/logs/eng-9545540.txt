And more deeply, just how far can the drive for meaning and purpose ultimately take you? The inDrive documentary (www.inDrive.com) sets out to answer these questions.\n\nIn an exclusive premier in Johannesburg, South Africa, the inDrive documentary offered audiences a rare glimpse into the heart and soul of the company, with never-before-seen footage and candid stories from the individuals at inDrive's roots, including founder and CEO Arsen Tomsky.\n\nFar from being a run-of-the-mill corporate film, this narrative delves deep into the butterfly effect of positive impact, illustrating how inDrive's initiatives have rippled through communities, creating waves of change that extend far beyond their initial touchpoints.\n\nIn the frozen Yakutsk winter, a group of people band together against the unfair price collusion of taxi companies that leaves people stranded in the cold. One of them starts a social media group where people can request and offer rides, negotiating prices on their own terms.\n\nIt's a simple enough idea, but it carries the potential to be revolutionary. From this frozen seed, a collective stance against injustice, inDrive takes root. Today, the company has grown to become the world's second largest ride-hailing app, operating in over 700 cities in 46 countries, fuelled by deep-seated ideals and ambitions that extend far beyond profit.\n\ninDrive wants to reimagine capitalism, no less: to put people back in control, restore their freedom to choose, and so make their lives better.\n\nAmong the heartwarming tales shared, the film follows the journey of Obadiah, a young Nigerian boy once enveloped in the despair of his surroundings. inDrive's Beginit initiative is now paving the way for a brighter future for him and many others.\n\nReflecting on the film and its message, inDrive Founder and CEO Arsen Tomsky said: \"We should focus on the path, on the journey. And if you do something important for you, that is very meaningful for you, and you develop an external environment during that journey, you are getting more and more with each step. And that is something which nobody can take from you. Even if you don't reach a peak, you will have something available to you.\"\n\nThe production is directed by Lagos/Nairobi-based, Emmy Award winner Dan McCain, and Greek producer and editor Theo Papadoulakis, each renowned for their talents in portraying everyday individuals facing remarkable situations. Dan is a prolific filmmaker who specializes in locally relevant and impactful storytelling, while Papadoulakis, recognized with over 70 international accolades, particularly excels in showcasing the resilience of the human spirit.\n\n\"In making this film with inDrive, we hope to honor the resilience and determination of individuals whose dreams lead to something profound. It's a privilege to be part of a multi-country international production, collaborating with other talented directors, where we weave together inspiring narratives that add to the epic tale of human potential,\" said Dan McCain.\n\nPerson by person, the documentary tells inDrive's story. From the remarkable individuals in Nigeria, Indonesia, Mexico and beyond, who use the ride-hailing app to take control of their futures, to the communities who take their chance to move forward.\n\nFrom Arsen Tomsky, the company's visionary CEO, who overcomes challenges both personal and social to take an idea to the world, to the employees who come on board to help inDrive evolve and grow, fuelled by shared values and a common goal. It's an epic journey, told by connecting people around the world. And it's far from over.\n\nAbout inDrive:\n\ninDrive is a global mobility and urban services platform. The inDrive app has been downloaded over 200 million times, and was the second most downloaded mobility app in 2022 and 2023. In addition to ride-hailing, inDrive provides an expanding list of urban services, including intercity transportation, freight delivery, task assistance and courier delivery.

On its website, inDrive states its mission by noting it stands to make the world \"a fairer place\" for over a billion people; the company notes it is operational in 749 cities spanning 46 countries worldwide and its app has been downloaded over 200 million times.\n\nMore than trying to make the world a better place, Tomsky told me inDrive thinks of itself as underdogs, largely due to the fact the company traces its origins to the \"coldest city on the planet\" in Yakutsk, Russia. He called Yakutsk as being at the \"edge of the world,\" telling me its remoteness meant inDrive was self-started with no means of external investment or other support; it was, literally and figuratively, Siberia.\n\n\"These things inform inDrive's ethos,\" Tomsky said. \"All our projects are concerned with challenging injustice and the development of something, whether it's businesses or philanthropic endeavors.\"\n\nAccording to Tomsky, inDrive began in 2012 in response to what he described as \"unfair price agreements among a cartel of local taxi companies\" in his hometown. A group of students and car owners started a social networking group wherein anyone could request a ride somewhere. This proved to be the spark for what would become inDrive, with Tomsky telling me rather romantically \"it was our destiny to enter the ride-hailing industry.\" In the years since, inDrive has grow a lot; the company recently announced its first foray into the fintech world with inDrive Money, its loan program for drivers. The company's focus has \"broadened a lot,\" over the years, Tomsky told me, with ride-hailing nowadays representing \"only a part\" of its ever-diversifying business.\n\n\"Establishing fairness and freedom of choice as the non-materialistic foundation of the company, along with high customer retention in our ride-hailing business, enabled us to create a global tech company,\" Tomsky said. \"[We are] one of the worldwide leaders in transportation.\"\n\nTomsky and I share something in common: we're both stutterers.\n\nNormally reticent as I am to use inspirational sentiment towards disability, I believe underdog is apt in this context. As a lifelong stutterer, it's been my experience my speech impediment has caused people to look at me with underestimation. They think, because I oftentimes struggle to get words out, that I'm somehow lesser of a human and someone incapable of conveying cogent, intelligent ideas.\n\nIt turns out that, also like me, Tomsky has had a strong preference for communicating with others via textual means, whether email or text. As inDrive has grown, however, Tomsky quickly realized he needed to venture out of his comfort zone and hone his interpersonal communication skills. To do so, he'd do sing in public or strike up conversation with random strangers at shopping malls. By pushing himself into these activities, Tomsky felt his confidence rise along with his communicative acumen -- all the while not using technology.\n\nNow, Tomsky has accepted his stutter as part and parcel of his existence.\n\n\"I'm okay with it,\" he said of having a speech disability. \"I consider it a gift of destiny now. During my adult life, I've never experienced any negative reactions to my speech, but I know people who stutter whose life has been really troubled or even ruined by this; there are many such people. It can also be a source of pain and a serious problem in childhood, when kids may be bullied because of their stutter.\"\n\nTo help stutterers feel more secure with their speech, Tomsky has a side hustle called FluentaAI. On its website, the startup describes itself as \"a speech converter that helps you to overcome stuttering during online calls.\" The software, available for Windows, Mac, and iOS, works with videoconferencing apps such as Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and others; after recording one's normal voice via headphones and enabling FluentaAI in one's meeting app of choice, users can whisper and the app will \"convert [it] into natural speech without stuttering.\" FluentaAI boasts it's an ideal solution for helping people reduce stress and worry, making them remain calmer during interviews and meetings.\n\nTomsky explained the whispering idea came about because there are times, such as when singing and whispering, when stutterers don't stutter at all. (I personally can confirm this to be true.) FluentaAI can, he said, process a whisper into normal speech in real-time with what he called a \"small delay\" in output. The first working prototype is currently in the pilot phase, with Tomsky telling me he hopes the app will help stutterers everywhere. He added researchers and scientists in the speech pathology space is another source of motivation for building FluentaAI.\n\nWhen asked about the future, Tomsky pivoted to inDrive and said \"we have built an outstanding company [and] we are going to grow to a company of the highest caliber globally\" which positively impacts the lives of \"hundreds of millions people.\" He added inDrive will continue to battle injustice atop what he called a \"non-materialistic foundation.\"\n\n\"We want not only to create significant and lasting positive change in the world, but [be an example] to other entrepreneurs and companies,\" he said. \"We want to reimagine modern business.

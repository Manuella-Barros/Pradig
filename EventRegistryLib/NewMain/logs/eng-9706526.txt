We want to have the ball, not hurt the player.\"\n\nYamal came to Euro 2024 with a bunch of 'youngest' records, and has inevitably set more. He became the youngest player to feature at a men's Euro when he started in Spain's opening 3-0 win over Croatia.\n\nHowever, Yamal has only just finished his first season in professional soccer, with Barcelona. Spain teammate Nico Williams -- who has also been drawing plaudits at age 21 -- has yet to play European club soccer with his team Athletic Bilbao.\n\nGermany also has a young and energetic attack in 21-year-olds Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz.

Not only have they featured regularly in top-level European matches, but they've often been decisive.\n\n\"My focus is not so much on Yamal but on Jamal,\" Nagelsmann said with a smile.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniella_matar@eagletribune.com", "name": "Daniella Matar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Wirtz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florian Wirtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yussuf_Poulsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yussuf Poulsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletic Bilbao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/af/daf09164-4a95-5253-9210-47f44fbd4e90/6686e6a8bff96.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706526", "eventUri": "eng-9706526", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

At just 16, and still within his country's education system, Yamal has been set school homework to do every day. On matchdays, leeway is offered, but his tutors know only too well when study is possible: it's national news.\n\nLast week, Yamal discovered that he had passed his fourth-year exams. A quick phone call home informed his family of the good news. They probably had other questions too, such as whether their son might soon lead his national team to Euro 2024 glory.\n\nMost in Spain saw this breakout coming. Yamal, born to Moroccan and Equatoguinean parents, joined Barcelona's La Masia academy at the age of seven and had always been promoted to teams above his age group. The records set are remarkable and numerous: Barcelona's youngest ever player; La Liga's youngest goalscorer, Spain's youngest goalscorer and now the youngest appearance maker in the history of the European Championship.\n\nWe also knew that Luis de la Fuente, Spain's coach, was a huge admirer. De la Fuente has spoken repeatedly of the need to protect and not overwork a player who will not leave his teenage years until a full year after the next World Cup final, but he compared Yamal's natural talent to \"being touched by the wand of God\". Time out of the limelight can wait, for now. First there is a major tournament to win.\n\nYamal, despite his age, is a ludicrously mature footballer. He plays as a left footer on the right wing, delighting in taking on and beating opponents with raw pace and skills that he honed as a child on the streets of Rocafona, a coastal town 40 minutes north of Barcelona.\n\n\"When you learn to play football in the street, it gives you more resources,\" Yamal told GQ. \"It makes you more mischievous than someone just trained in an academy.\"\n\nThe combination of Yamal and Nico Williams, another young, direct and fabulously talented wide forward, has defined Spain's tournament. With captain Alvaro Morata as the centre-forward presence, demanding central defender attention, Spain's other attack-minded players buzz and fizz. Yamal's party trick at Euro 2024 have been his inswinging crosses from open play. They have provided both of his assists so far.\n\nThe natural environment for young talent to flourish is harmony around them, reducing the onus on the prodigy to produce consistently and allowing for an ease of acclimatisation without deafening noise. Forget the dribbling and crossing for now; Yamal's greatest attribute is ignoring the upheaval around him.\n\nAt Barcelona, with their financial crisis and the levers of creative accounting to postpone outright emergency, it created opportunity. The only transfer fee higher than \u00a33m paid since August 2022 was on Vitor Roque, a Brazilian teenager.\n\nWithout the ability to spend at will, Barcelona leant on La Masia again. Last season in La Liga, Yamal, Pau Cubarsi, Hector Fort, Marc Guiu, Alejandro Balde and Gavi shared 96 appearances. All are 20 or under and all are La Masia graduates; Yamal accounted for more than a third of those appearances.\n\nBut the same is true at international level. The 2022 World Cup campaign was abject, Spain finishing below Japan in the group stage and then losing to Morocco on penalties in the last-16. The following year, Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales was suspended after forcefully kissing forward Jenni Hermoso after the Women's World Cup final. When Rubiales gave a speech lambasting \"false feminism\", De la Fuente was seen in the audience applauding.\n\nThe promotion of Yamal to the senior setup was not a direct response, but you see the point. Spain needed a change of mood, an attempt to seize something new, long-term, sustainable and of great value. The answer was freshness and verve. What better way to forget the past than by offering a glimpse of the future.\n\nIn doing so, Yamal has become the present. He is now favourite to be named the Young Player of the Tournament in Germany and would still be eligible for the same award in 2028. Next comes a quarter-final against the hosts in Stuttgart; each fixture becomes the biggest of Yamal's young life. Maybe go easy off the homework this week, sir.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_storey@inews.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Storey",

Jamaal Bowman had promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories on his blog while working as a public school principal, the New York Democrat maintained it was just a bygone phase, and that his days of marinating in the nether-swamps of online paranoia were long over. But his personal YouTube account, where he continued to follow new channels and create playlists as recently as last month, indicates his taste for fringe content has endured into his tenure on Capitol Hill.\n\nBowman's page, which uses his longtime screen name \"Inner Peace\" and features his image and videos from the middle school he once led, subscribes to dozens of bewildering and bizarre accounts -- including known Russian and Chinese disinfo peddlers, flat earthers, musings about UFOs and \"signs you're being prepared to cross to the new earth,\" a U.S.-born Muslim influencer who killed a German citizen and provoked attacks on American businesses in Egypt, and many arcane online realms in between.\n\n\"This CIA Document Literally Explains Time Travel (practical steps included),\" crows the title of one post on an account the congressman follows called Video Advice, which also frequently shares conspiracy content about the Illuminati and the Catholic Church. Another recording on the same page blares: \"Kanye Exposes the Truth: 'The Secret Codes They Don't Want You to Know.'\"\n\n\"'We use the RIGHT FREQUENCIES' (hidden numerology used by the elite),\" is the name of a video on another account called Be Inspired, which Bowman also follows.\n\n\"'100% Alien Technology' - Something Big Being Hidden From Us,\" alleges a video on a page called Anonymous Official, another Bowman subscription, which frequently also pushes content by serial sex offender and Vladimir Putin-booster Scott Ritter, such as \"What's Coming is WORSE Than a WW3, Iran is Ready.\"\n\nThese follows might seem unusual for a member of Congress -- but less so for a man who published poetry The Daily Beast uncovered that promoted debunked conspiracies about the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Bowman's verse, first published on his blog Relentless-Strongback.blogspot.com in 2011 when he was 35, also urged readers to watch the pseudo-documentaries 'Loose Change' and 'Zeitgeist,' both of which earned the endorsement of arch-paranoia-pusher Alex Jones. Bowman's poem also included an explicit shout-out to William Cooper, an Arizona broadcaster whose anti-government rants made him a pivotal figure in the American militia movement.\n\nAlthough the congressman has since disowned his old heroes as \"cranks,\" his YouTube subscriptions reflect a similar blending of right and left. Anonymous Official, for instance, uses the name and symbols of the anarchist hacker collective -- but shares clips of conservative populist figures such as Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. Bowman also follows Stephen Gardner, a pro-Trump YouTube influencer who also promotes the idea that the federal government is hiding evidence of aliens, while critiquing U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nIn fact, Ritter, Rogan, and Carlson recur across multiple channels Bowman subscribes to, as does former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, as well as claims about alleged government plots to conceal extraterrestrials, an imminent third world war emerging from American support of Ukraine and Israel, and content about inventor Nikola Tesla and his supposed knowledge of mysterious vibrations that pervade the universe and various parallel dimensions. Bowman also follows mainstream and apolitical accounts, such as National Geographic and ESPN, and musical artists like Busta Rhymes and Eminem.\n\nBowman's campaign did not deny the Inner Peace account belonged to him, but supplied a statement from the lawmaker disclaiming even the faintest familiarity with the extreme and outlandish content he subscribed to. Bowman also downplayed the importance of his social media exposures in the face of what he characterized as domestic and international crises.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know these accounts, and I haven't watched any of these videos. There is a war going on that has killed tens of thousands of innocents and people here can't afford rent and groceries, I think people care more about that than some convoluted story about videos that I haven't even watched.\"\n\nFurther, Bowman has publicly identified himself in the past as a frequent YouTube user. At a panel discussion held at an Islamic center in the city of Yonkers in January, the Democrat described himself as \"starstruck\" to introduce the incendiary academic Norman Finkelstein, whom he said he knew from online videos.\n\n\"I watch them all the time on YouTube,\" said Bowman, who subsequently had to denounce Finkelstein's praise of Hamas' bloody raid into Israeli territory on Oct. 7.\n\nSure enough, several of the pages Inner Peace follows -- including DiEM25, Real News Network, Free Will, PoliticsJOE, TRT World -- feature interviews with Finkelstein.\n\nMoreover, a number of the accounts Bowman has subscribed to are of recent vintage: more recent, even, than his own ascent to power in 2020. For instance, one called Afripost -- where recent video titles announce \"Vatican Angry as PUTIN Declares Russia will Only Worship THE BLACK JESUS\" and \"African Historian Reveals hidden Secret: God did NOT CREATE WHITE: The Bible is all about BLACKS\" (capitalization original) -- was created in April of last year, just a few months after Bowman started his second term.\n\nAfripost also frequently shares speeches by controversial Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan, known for his antisemitic rhetoric. The most recent such video asserts, falsely, \"BLACKS ARE THE TRUE J\u00a3WS [sic].\"\n\nBowman also subscribes to an account called Thinkers Forum, created in late 2021, toward the end of his first year representing parts of the Bronx and Westchester County in the House. Thinkers Forum is a project of The China Academy, which bills itself as \"one of China's most influential current affairs and intellectual content outlet [sic],\" and boasts ties to an array of Chinese state-backed institutions. Recent videos posted to the Thinkers Forum channel include \"Why the West 'takes pleasure' in seeing the genocide in Palestine?\" \"Why NATO is collapsing like the Soviet Union, by the same mistake,\" and \"How the US Keeps Fighting China, Knowing It Won't Win?\"\n\nThinkers Forum also recently posted a translation of a Chinese state university professor's evidence-free speculation that the terrorist attack at a Moscow concert hall was the work of Ukraine and Western intelligence services -- even though a faction of the Islamic State took responsibility for the assault.\n\nA few months earlier, in July 2021 -- six months into Bowman's stint on the Hill -- another channel was born called Middle Nation, which the congressman at some indeterminate point followed. Middle Nation belongs to Shahid Bolsen, a Colorado-born Muslim convert who used his prior social media accounts to urge Islamist militants to attack so-called \"corporate crusaders\" that had set up shop in Egypt. Bolsen, previously imprisoned on a manslaughter conviction in the United Arab Emirates for killing a German engineer, uses his new channel to rail against \"The Loud, Hollow American Empire,\" \"The Prison of American Hegemony,\" Western \"materialism,\" the U.S.'s supposedly \"fake ceasefire\" proposals to end the conflict in the Gaza Strip.\n\nOne of the loopiest pages Bowman follows also came into being that same year: Wired Mind, which exclusively promotes the ideas of late New Age icon Dolores Cannon, known for her advocacy of conspiracies about aliens, reincarnation, and the lost island of Atlantis. Wired Mind urges its viewers to prepare for an impending \"shift\" to a higher reality, and offers advice on such dilemmas as \"Are You an Alien Among Us? Signs You Might Not Be from This World\" and \"Think You're Going Crazy? Surprise! You're Actually Awakening Your Spirit!\"\n\nFinally, Bowman also follows BreakThrough News, which established its YouTube presence in early 2020, while the Democrat was on the campaign warpath against then-incumbent Rep. Eliot Engel. As The Daily Beast reported last spring, BreakThrough News draws its staff from Russian state-owned media and cash from Neville \"Roy\" Singham, a U.S. tech mogul ensconced in Shanghai -- and pushes the favorite propaganda narratives of Moscow and Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bowman worked on the since-deleted blog when he was a principal at a middle school, a job he's often constantly reminded people he has had. The Daily Beast, which had unearthed the blog earlier this year, is now reporting that \"Squad Rep's YouTube Page Is a Conspiracy Theorist's Dream.\"\n\nWhereas the blog posts were deleted sometime before February 2016, his personal YouTube account, \"Inner Peace,\" as recently as last month shows the Squad member still has an interest in conspiracy theories.\n\nAs the report mentioned:\n\nWhen The Daily Beast revealed in January that Rep. Jamaal Bowman had promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories on his blog while working as a public school principal, the New York Democrat maintained it was just a bygone phase, and that his days of marinating in the nether-swamps of online paranoia were long over. But his personal YouTube account, where he continued to follow new channels and create playlists as recently as last month, indicates his taste for fringe content has endured into his tenure on Capitol Hill.\n\nBowman's page, which uses his longtime screen name \"Inner Peace\" and features his image and videos from the middle school he once led, subscribes to dozens of bewildering and bizarre accounts -- including known Russian and Chinese disinfo peddlers, flat earthers, musings about UFOs and \"signs you're being prepared to cross to the new earth,\" a U.S.-born Muslim influencer who killed a German citizen and provoked attacks on American businesses in Egypt, and many arcane online realms in between.\n\n\"This CIA Document Literally Explains Time Travel (practical steps included),\" crows the title of one post on an account the congressman follows called Video Advice, which also frequently shares conspiracy content about the Illuminati and the Catholic Church. Another recording on the same page blares: \"Kanye Exposes the Truth: 'The Secret Codes They Don't Want You to Know.'\"\n\n\"'We use the RIGHT FREQUENCIES' (hidden numerology used by the elite),\" is the name of a video on another account called Be Inspired, which Bowman also follows.\n\n\"'100% Alien Technology' - Something Big Being Hidden From Us,\" alleges a video on a page called Anonymous Official, another Bowman subscription, which frequently also pushes content by serial sex offender and Vladimir Putin-booster Scott Ritter, such as \"What's Coming is WORSE Than a WW3, Iran is Ready.\"\n\nThe report also tellingly highlights how Bowman's campaign did not deny the YouTube account belonged to him. What statement that was provided expresses sheer ignorance, though, which is arguably just as bad.\n\nThe rambling statement instead mostly referenced other issues:\n\nBowman's campaign did not deny the Inner Peace account belonged to him, but supplied a statement from the lawmaker disclaiming even the faintest familiarity with the extreme and outlandish content he subscribed to. Bowman also downplayed the importance of his social media exposures in the face of what he characterized as domestic and international crises.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know these accounts, and I haven't watched any of these videos. There is a war going on that has killed tens of thousands of innocents and people here can't afford rent and groceries, I think people care more about that than some convoluted story about videos that I haven't even watched.\"\n\nIt's an awfully bold move for Bowman to claim that people wouldn't care so much about the videos. Regardless, it's not the only strike against him. Given that he's a member of the anti-Israel Squad, he's almost certainly talking about the Israel-Hamas conflict, with a particular focus on empathizing with those in Gaza. The mention about \"tens of thousands of innocents\" being \"killed\" is propaganda. Even Hamas acknowledged last month they inflated the death toll.\n\nHigh prices are indeed a pressing issue in New York and around the country, but Bowman's district is a heavily Democrat one, and the state government is also controlled by Democrats in a trifecta.\n\nBowman may also be coming off as desperate, given that there's a real chance he could lose his primary to Westchester County Executive on June 25. A pro-Latimer poll from last month showed Latimer leading 52-35 percent among Democratic primary voters.\n\nThe congressman has not posted to either of his X accounts about the report, though plenty of other users have, as our sister site of Twitchy covered.\n\nWhat Bowman did post and repost about on Wednesday was a gleeful celebration about the pro-Hamas protests on college campuses and the announcement President Joe Biden himself shared with CNN that he'll continue to block ammunition to Israel if they invade Rafah.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Jamaal Bowman Loves Some Conspiracy Theories", "body": "Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) has a reputation for odd behavior. Earlier this year, he was censured for pulling a fire alarm in the House in an attempt to disrupt a vote on the floor.\n\nPartisan Democrats don't seem to mind his behavior. He's a member of The Squad. Bowman has created a stir by trolling conservative House members and picking a fight with them in the hallways of Congress, always in front of reporters. He raises his voice and yells unhinged as he argues while cameras click and microphones record the debates.\n\nThe Daily Beast has an article today about Bowman's YouTube page. It seems the progressive congressman loves him some conspiracy theories. He said in January that he regretted some of his past support of 9/11 conspiracy theories on his blog. At the time he was a public school principal. Bowman said it was a phase with which he is now finished. However, his YouTube page includes a playlist of fringe content as recently as last month.\n\nBowman uses the screen name of 'Inner Peace\" and he posts images and videos from the middle school where he was principal on his page. He subscribes to dozens of unusual accounts. Some of the accounts are Russian and Chinese disinformation accounts and flat earthers. He follows a U.S.-born Muslim influencer who killed a German citizen. It's a strange list of interests.\n\n\"This CIA Document Literally Explains Time Travel (practical steps included),\" crows the title of one post on an account the congressman follows called Video Advice, which also frequently shares conspiracy content about the Illuminati and the Catholic Church. Another recording on the same page blares: \"Kanye Exposes the Truth: 'The Secret Codes They Don't Want You to Know.'\"\n\n\"'We use the RIGHT FREQUENCIES' (hidden numerology used by the elite),\" is the name of a video on another account called Be Inspired, which Bowman also follows.\n\n\"'100% Alien Technology' - Something Big Being Hidden From Us,\" alleges a video on a page called Anonymous Official, another Bowman subscription, which frequently also pushes content by serial sex offender and Vladimir Putin-booster Scott Ritter, such as \"What's Coming is WORSE Than a WW3, Iran is Ready.\"\n\nYikes.\n\nBowman denies he watches such content online. He also denied pulling the fire alarm in the House, though there is a video of him doing that. So...\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know these accounts, and I haven't watched any of these videos. There is a war going on that has killed tens of thousands of innocents and people here can't afford rent and groceries, I think people care more about that than some convoluted story about videos that I haven't even watched.\"\n\nFurther, Bowman has publicly identified himself in the past as a frequent YouTube user. At a panel discussion held at an Islamic center in the city of Yonkers in January, the Democrat described himself as \"starstruck\" to introduce the incendiary academic Norman Finkelstein, whom he said he knew from online videos.\n\n\"I watch them all the time on YouTube,\" said Bowman, who subsequently had to denounce Finkelstein's praise of Hamas' bloody raid into Israeli territory on Oct. 7.\n\nBowman shares videos by Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. He follows Stephen Gardner, a pro-Trump influencer who claims the federal government is hiding evidence of aliens. Gardner criticizes U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nHe subscribed to some fringe accounts since he was elected in 2020. In other words, his unusual viewing habits aren't necessarily in his past, as he claimed. He shares videos of speeches by Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan, a well-known antisemite.\n\nBowman has an antisemite problem, as do other members of The Squad. This week he hosted a fundraiser at a private residence in Fairfax, Virginia with Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Awad praised the massacres in Israel on October 7, 2023, by Hamas. The White House has condemned him.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) plans to spend millions of dollars to unseat Bowman.\n\nBowman is fundraising off his antisemitism.\n\n\"As a direct result of his call for a Gaza ceasefire, AIPAC has vowed to spend $100 million against progressive members of Congress -- and Jamaal is their top target,\" the flyer for the Bowman event reads.\n\nAIPAC, and other more moderate Democrats are backing George Latimer, the popular Westchester County Executive.\n\nThis guy is a piece of work.

Jamaal Bowman Had Secret YouTube Page Subscribed To Channels That Shared Antisemitic, Flat Earth And Illuminati Conspiracy Videos", "body": "\"Squad\" member Representative Jamaal Bowman has allegedly been linked to a private YouTube account that subscribed to channels promoting controversial conspiracy theories, some of which are tied to antisemitism.\n\nReports from the Daily Beast suggest that the Bronx and Westchester Democrat was actively curating playlists under the alias \"Inner Peace\" as recently as last month.\n\nThe Daily Beast detailed that the Inner Peace channel was following numerous accounts that propagated unconventional beliefs ranging from aliens and flat Earth theory to UFOs and the Illuminati.\n\nThe Daily Beast noted that the channel featured imagery and footage from the Bronx middle school, where Bowman previously served as principal for a decade.\n\nSome of the channels purportedly followed by Bowman, such as BreakThrough News, have been identified for disseminating Chinese and Russian propaganda.\n\nTitles like \"The American Takeover: How 2 Years of War Made Ukraine a US Colony\" from BreakThrough News exemplify the nature of content hosted on these platforms.\n\nBreakThrough News also hosts content critical of Israel, a stance consistent with Bowman's perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nOther channels, including DiEM25, Free Will, PoliticsJOE, and Real News Network, have showcased interviews with figures like anti-Semite Norman Finkelstein, whom Bowman praised during a panel discussion on the Israel-Hamas conflict earlier this year.\n\nAfripost, another channel reportedly followed by Bowman, frequently shares speeches by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, known for his controversial remarks about Jews.\n\nFarrakhan's video titled \"BLACKS ARE THE TRUE J\u00a3WS [sic]\" reflects the propagation of antisemitic conspiracy theories by certain fringe groups.\n\nSome accounts promoted content that delved into speculative topics such as alternate realities and extraterrestrial life.\n\nFor instance, videos like \"6 Signs You're Leaving The Matrix For The New Earth\" from Wired Mind hint at a departure from conventional thought.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Bowman denied familiarity with the accounts or their content, emphasizing pressing issues like war casualties and economic hardships faced by many.\n\nHe stated, \"There is a war going on that has killed tens of thousands of innocents and people here can't afford rent and groceries, I think people care more about that than some convoluted story about videos that I haven't even watched.\"\n\nHowever, Bowman's past statements hinted at his interest in YouTube content, particularly when he introduced Finkelstein at an event in Westchester.\n\n\"I'm a bit starstruck,\" Bowman admitted, indicating his admiration for Finkelstein's work, which he claimed to watch frequently on YouTube.\n\nMany of the channels under scrutiny boast substantial subscriber bases, indicating significant viewership.\n\nEarlier this year, Bowman faced controversy when the Daily Beast uncovered an old blog from the early 2010s containing a poem with conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe congressman later distanced himself from the writings, attributing them to a period of personal exploration.\n\n\"Well over a

The Daily Beast reported that \"Inner Peace\" included images and footage from the Bronx middle school that Bowman founded and served as principal for 10 years.\n\nSome of the channels purportedly followed by Bowman, such as BreakThrough News, have been known to disseminate Chinese and Russian propaganda.\n\n\"The American Takeover: How 2 Years of War Made Ukraine a US Colony,\" one video from that channel is titled.\n\nBreakThrough News is also rife with anti-Israel content, much of which appears to be in keeping with Bowman's views of the Jewish state's war against Hamas.\n\nOther channels, including DiEM25, Free Will, PoliticsJOE, and Real News Network, have featured interviews with pro-terror professor Norman Finkelstein, who Bowman lauded at a panel discussion on the Israel-Hamas war this past January.\n\nStill another channel reportedly embraced by Bowman, Afripost, repeatedly shares speeches by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has referred to Jews as \"termites\" and \"the synagogue of Satan.\"\n\nA recent Farrakhan video is titled \"BLACKS ARE THE TRUE J\u00a3WS [sic],\" referring to an antisemitic conspiracy theory pushed by the fringe Black Hebrew Israelite sect.\n\nOther accounts promoted content that was out of this world.\n\n\"6 Signs You're Leaving The Matrix For The New Earth,\" reads the title on a video from Wired Mind posted some three months ago.\n\n\"Signs You Might Not Be from This World,\" reads another video from that account, which promotes content from the late Dolores Cannon, an author and New Age leader who trafficked in dubious claims about aliens, the mythical island city of Atlantis, and alternate realities.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know these accounts, and I haven't watched any of these videos,\" Bowman claimed in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\n\"There is a war going on that has killed tens of thousands of innocents and people here can't afford rent and groceries, I think people care more about that than some convoluted story about videos that I haven't even watched.\"\n\nHowever, Bowman dropped hints that he was an avid YouTube consumer when he introduced Finkelstein at a Westchester event.\n\n\"I'm a bit starstruck,\" Bowman said of the disgraced prof's work, per Jewish Insider. \"I watch them all the time on YouTube.\"\n\nMany of the channels in question have tens of thousands of subscribers.\n\nEarlier this year, Bowman was engulfed in controversy after the Daily Beast dug up his old blog from the early 2010s, which featured a poem that included a conspiracy theory about the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"2001/Planes used as missiles/Target: The Twin Towers,\" it read. \"Later in the day/Building 7/Also Collaspsed [sic]/Hmm.../Multiple explosions/Heard before/And during the collapse/Hmm...\"\n\nThe congressman later distanced himself from those writings.\n\n\"Well over a decade ago, as I was debating diving into a doctoral degree, I explored a wide range of books, films, and articles across a wide swath of the political spectrum and processed my thoughts in a personal blog that few people ever read,\" Bowman said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nThe Post contacted Bowman's office and campaign for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jamaal Bowman had promoted 9/11 conspiracy theories on his blog while working as a public school principal, the New York Democrat maintained it was just a bygone phase, and that his days of marinating in the nether-swamps of online paranoia were long over. But his personal YouTube account, where he continued to follow new channels and create playlists as recently as last month, indicates his taste for fringe content has endured into his tenure on Capitol Hill.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nBowman has publicly identified himself in the past as a frequent YouTube user. At a panel discussion held at an Islamic center in the city of Yonkers in January, the Democrat described himself as \"starstruck\" to introduce the incendiary academic Norman Finkelstein, whom he said he knew from online videos.\n\n\"I watch them all the time on YouTube,\" said Bowman, who subsequently had to denounce Finkelstein's praise of Hamas' bloody raid into Israeli territory on Oct. 7.\n\nSure enough, several of the pages Inner Peace follows -- including DiEM25, Real News Network, Free Will, PoliticsJOE, TRT World -- feature interviews with Finkelstein.\n\nMoreover, a number of the accounts Bowman has subscribed to are of recent vintage: more recent, even, than his own ascent to power in 2020. For instance, one called Afripost -- where recent video titles announce \"Vatican Angry as PUTIN Declares Russia will Only Worship THE BLACK JESUS\" and \"African Historian Reveals hidden Secret: God did NOT CREATE WHITE: The Bible is all about BLACKS\" (capitalization original) -- was created in April of last year, just a few months after Bowman started his second term.\n\nAfripost also frequently shares speeches by controversial Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan, known for his antisemitic rhetoric. The most recent such video asserts, falsely, \"BLACKS ARE THE TRUE J\u00a3WS [sic].\"\n\nFlashbacks:\n\n\u25cf Three Democrats Attended Private Dinner With Iran's President And Louis Farrakhan.\n\n\u25cf Establishment Media Bury Obama-Farrakhan Photo.\n\n\u25cf The deep meaning of Keith Ellison.\n\n\u25cf Nation of Islam activists on Obama camp payroll.

Jamaal Bowman Is a Subscriber.", "body": "Congressman's 'Inner Peace' account subscribes to anti-Semitic channel\n\nSubscribers to Afripost, a YouTube channel with a purported mission to \"preach black consciousness,\" are regularly met with videos of anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan railing against Jews as \"enemies\" who control black people. One of those subscribers is New York Democratic congressman Jamaal Bowman.\n\nAfripost regularly features video of Farrakhan, who has compared Jews to \"termites\" and praised Adolf Hitler as a \"very great man.\" The channel's host calls Farrakhan a \"minister who really fights and speaks against issues and the ills of society that are targeting black people.\" Bowman subscribes to the conspiracy theory channels via his own YouTube channel, \"Inner Peace,\" the Daily Beast reported Wednesday.\n\nThe thumbnail to one of Afripost's videos from this week, titled \"Minister Louis Farrakhan Exposes Hidden Secret About Black and J\u00a3WS [sic]: TRUTH SETS US FREE,\" says that \"blacks are the true Jews\" and features a Farrakhan speech in which the Nation of Islam minister asks if black people are controlled by \"Jewish leaders.\"\n\n\"You will not lead black people, being controlled by Jews, you will not lead black people being controlled by our enemies. You either come out and stand for us, or you get the hell away from us,\" Farrakhan said in the speech. \"Who is your master? Is it God? Is it Jesus Christ? Or is it the Jewish leaders in America? Who is your master?\"\n\nThe channel's host said at the end of the video that his mission is to find \"the remaining true son of Africa\" and \"preach black consciousness.\" The host said his channel highlights Farrakhan, alongside other leaders, because they have \"really championed issues that matter to the black person in the African continent.\"\n\nNews of Bowman's connection to the channel comes as the congressman has alienated Jewish voters with anti-Israel rhetoric since Oct. 7, accusing Israel of \"mass murder,\" \"genocide,\" and \"ethnic cleansing.\" Far-left groups that excuse Hamas's terrorism are working to boost Bowman's embattled primary campaign, in which the two-term congressman finds himself 17 points behind pro-Israel challenger George Latimer.\n\nOne of the Hamas apologist groups campaigning to get Bowman across the finish line, MoveOn, has defended Linda Sarsour as a \"leader in the fight for justice for all of us.\" Sarsour, who also has ties to Farrakhan, was ousted from the anti-Donald Trump group she helped lead, the Women's March, over her track record of anti-Semitism.\n\nThis is not the first time Bowman has dabbled in conspiracy theories. The New York congressman penned a poem that called the 9/11 attacks a false-flag operation that the government used to wage war in the Middle East, the Daily Beast reported this year. That news prompted harsh backlash from Thomas Von Essen, who was the New York City fire commissioner on 9/11.\n\n\"I've been dealing with these imbeciles for over 20 years now, where I've been accused of planting bombs every 10 floors in the Trade Center and things like that,\" Von Essen told Politico.\n\nBowman has indicated that he spends much of his time surfing the internet, specifically on YouTube.\n\nDuring a Jan. 14 panel discussion titled \"Palestine Oct. 7th and After,\" Bowman gushingly introduced anti-Israel author Norman Finkelstein, who celebrated Hamas's massacre as \"heroic resistance\" that \"warm[ed] every fiber\" of his soul. \"I'm also a bit starstruck, because I watch them all the time on YouTube,\" Bowman said of Finkelstein and two other anti-Israel panelists. \"You have given me the knowledge on YouTube even before coming here.\"\n\nHe later retracted the statement.\n\n\"I had seen a few interviews but was unaware of Norman Finkelstein's completely reprehensible comments before this event,\" Bowman tweeted in January.", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Lefties never do.\n\nA 'Squad' member could be a 9/11 truther who committed a crime in Congress, have praised racists and a cop killer, toured with a Holocaust denier, and they'd still campaign for Rep. Jamaal Bowman.\n\nThe only surprise about the latest chapter of Bowman's career is that the media is digging it up.\n\nIt turns out, unsurprisingly, that Rep. Bowman's personal YouTube channel follows every crazy rabbit hole from UFOs to conspiracy theories to time travel. Among them is black nationalism and straight-up racism.\n\nFor instance, one called Afripost -- where recent video titles announce \"Vatican Angry as PUTIN Declares Russia will Only Worship THE BLACK JESUS\" and \"African Historian Reveals hidden Secret: God did NOT CREATE WHITE: The Bible is all about BLACKS\" (capitalization original) -- was created in April of last year, just a few months after Bowman started his second term.\n\nAfripost also frequently shares speeches by controversial Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan, known for his antisemitic rhetoric. The most recent such video asserts, falsely, \"BLACKS ARE THE TRUE J\u00a3WS [sic].\"\n\nLeast surprising thing ever. This stuff is being taught in colleges now. Multiple members of the Biden administration were into it.\n\nBut there's China which has figured out how to infect woke brains much the way Russia and Hamas did.\n\nBowman also subscribes to an account called Thinkers Forum, created in late 2021, toward the end of his first year representing parts of the Bronx and Westchester County in the House. Thinkers Forum is a project of The China Academy, which bills itself as \"one of China's most influential current affairs and intellectual content outlet [sic],\" and boasts ties to an array of Chinese state-backed institutions. Recent videos posted to the Thinkers Forum channel include \"Why the West 'takes pleasure' in seeing the genocide in Palestine?\" \"Why NATO is collapsing like the Soviet Union, by the same mistake,\" and \"How the US Keeps Fighting China, Knowing It Won't Win?\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, who sees foreign agents everywhere except in his own party, can't be reached for comment.\n\nA few months earlier, in July 2021 -- six months into Bowman's stint on the Hill -- another channel was born called Middle Nation, which the congressman at some indeterminate point followed. Middle Nation belongs to Shahid Bolsen, a Colorado-born Muslim convert who used his prior social media accounts to urge Islamist militants to attack so-called \"corporate crusaders\" that had set up shop in Egypt. Bolsen, previously imprisoned on a manslaughter conviction in the United Arab Emirates for killing a German engineer\n\nWhat does a Squad member's brain look like? Here we get a sneak peek into a horrifying mess of racism, terrorism, antisemitism and treason.\n\nIt's not just Rep. Jamaal Bowman.

Jamaal Bowman Is an Even Bigger Loon Than You Thought", "body": "When the Daily Beast revealed in January that \"Squad\" member Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) used to promote 9/11 conspiracy theories while serving as principal of Cornerstone Academy for Social Action, I had no idea that the Beast was just getting started.\n\nThis week, the Beast's William Bredderman revealed that, despite Bowman's protests that the 9/11 stuff was all in his past, his current YouTube account -- \"Inner Peace\" -- \"subscribes to dozens of bewildering and bizarre accounts -- including known Russian and Chinese disinfo peddlers, flat earthers, musings about UFOs and 'signs you're being prepared to cross to the new earth.'\"\n\nBowman's personal YouTube account, Bredderman wrote, \"indicates his taste for fringe content has endured into his tenure on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nSo what kind of things does \"Inner Peace\" bookmark, follow, and favorite on YouTube? Bredderman has the details:\n\nNone of that seems very inner peaceful to me. But what do I know -- I'm one of those sheeple who usually responds to truthers with, \"Fire melts steel. Shut up.\"\n\nHowever, aside from CIA time travel, secret frequencies, and alien technology -- plus his previously known predilection for terrorists, antisemites, and democratic socialism -- Bowman seems like a perfectly reasonable fellow.\n\nASIDE: Public figures who use YouTube like that are like people who leave comments on pr0n sites -- what the hell are they thinking?\n\n\"Although the congressman has since disowned his old heroes as 'cranks,' his YouTube subscriptions reflect a similar blending of right and left,\" Bredderman noted. So what does Bowman really believe? Aside from saying and doing whatever it takes to advance the career of Jamaal Bowman -- including dropping his affiliations with the Democratic Socialists of America and various antisemites as soon as it became politically expedient -- no one could really say for sure.\n\nKudos, by the way, to Bredderman for doing the hard work on this story. The Beast doesn't often give conservatives reason to praise it, but we ought to reward good acts wherever we find them.\n\nThere's a bigger issue here, and it has to do with the quality of the loons American voters now send to Congress.\n\nWhen Mark Twain remarked, \"It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress,\" he was being uncharacteristically generous in his estimation. \"Suppose you were an idiot,\" he also said, \"and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself.\"\n\nCongress has long been the domain of idiots, thieves, and loons. I believe that's partly because no one else would take the job and partly, as Dave Barry once wrote, sending some idiot, thief, or loon to Congress is a great way to get them to leave town.\n\nBut it seems that we used to elect a better class of idiots, thieves, and loons who could at least sometimes get something positive accomplished. After five decades of Joe Biden and just two terms of Jamaal Bowman, that seems like a very long time ago.\n\nRecommended: Milei Is Absolutely Killing It in Argentina\n\nP.S.

A freelance flack for Hamas! A fire-alarm insurrectionist!\n\nAnd now it turns out -- in the most unsurprising development imaginable -- that Westchester Rep. Jamaal Bowman seems to be an avid consumer of schizoid YouTube conspiracy theory.\n\nIs there anything the man can't do?\n\nThe Daily Beast dug up Bowman's personal YouTube account (ID'd based on the account's use of Bowman's longtime screen name \"Inner Peace\" and the fact that it features his image and videos from the school where he served as principal) and called the Squad member out for the loony stuff he subscribes to.\n\nLike BreakThrough News, a laundry for Russian and Chinese propaganda and viciously antisemitic content (with connections to Maoist millionaire Neville Roy Singham).\n\nOr Afripost, a staunch fan of Nation of Islam muckamuck Louis Farrakhan.\n\nLike Video Advice, which shares content like \"This CIA Document Literally Explains Time Travel (practical steps included).\"\n\nDon't forget actual channels of disinfo like the Thinkers Forum, a seeming cutout for organs of China's government.\n\nThat account amplifies (for example) conspiracist nonsense assigning blame for the Islamic State concert-hall terror atrocity in Moscow to Ukraine and US intelligence services.\n\nThe Beast's been on the case about Bowman's bonkers beliefs for a while, revealing that on his blog in the early Oughts he published a poem about 9/11 reading \"2001/Planes used as missiles/Target: The Twin Towers . . . . Later in the day/Building 7/Also Collapsed [sic]/Hmm.../Multiple explosions/Heard before/And during the collapse/Hmm...\"\n\nCriticisms of his prosody aside, it's abundantly clear what Bowman meant.\n\nWhen that poem surfaced, he tried to pretend he'd somehow moved on (he was in his 30's when he wrote it).\n\nNow that his YouTube shenanigans have come to light, he's falling back on Dems' fave tactic: telling obvious, clumsy lies.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know these accounts, and I haven't watched any of these videos,\" he claimed -- despite his campaign not denying the page was his and the fact that he was creating playlists as recently as April.\n\nOf course, he lied about why he pulled that fire alarm, too -- and video proved it\n\nBowman's been given a pass by his fellow Dems and most of the media so far, so there's a sad, real chance this BS will fly.\n\nBut we suspect the voters he's facing in his bruising primary will feel a bit differently.",

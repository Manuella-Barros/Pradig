He's also running for Senate in Ohio.", "body": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nThe 2015 Aston Martin Vulcan can go from zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds and maxes out at 208 mph. Only 24 of the two-door, two-seater carbon-fiber British speedsters were ever made, each with a $2.3 million price tag.\n\nThey also aren't street legal in the United States. Since the car doesn't comply with the Clean Air Act's emissions standards, importing one requires an EPA exemption. Aston Martin was granted just nine between March 2015 and February 2017, on the condition they be used \"solely for competition.\"\n\nBut on a sunny day in November 2015, Bernie Moreno took a shiny new cherry-red Vulcan -- part of his \"personal collection,\" a local reporter noted -- for a spin outside Cleveland. At least three police cars escorted Moreno down usually busy suburban streets.\n\nAt the time, the flashy outing helped publicize Moreno's massive portfolio of car dealerships in Ohio, where the multimillionaire is currently the Republican nominee for US Senate. Those dealerships, along with others in Florida, Kentucky, and Massachusetts, helped make Moreno a very wealthy man. So far, he's loaned his own campaign $4.5 million of its $10.9 million war chest, according to Federal Election Commission reports.\n\nMoreno's campaign did not respond to questions about the legality of the joyride. Public records from North Olmsted, the suburb Moreno spun through, provide no indication Moreno ever paid it or its police for the escort or road closures. And while the campaign says Aston Martin was responsible for importing the car, and the company insists it did so legally, Moreno once said the opposite.\n\n\"Nobody's here from the EPA, right? Good,\" Moreno winkingly asked a crowd gathered to admire the Vulcan at a 2016 event. \"The car's actually not legally allowed to be in the United States. It is now, but it wasn't back in October when we got the car,\" he boasted in a little-noticed video. \"We shipped it in as car parts,\" he said, explaining that the steering wheel, worth $20,000 on its own, had been imported separately for the purpose of skirting EPA regulations.\n\nFor its part, Aston Martin says a new steering wheel was later sent to replace a faulty one originally imported with the car. But in boasting about such a gambit, Moreno -- a big spender whose holdings include pricey Florida real estate -- displayed a Trump-like belief that following legal requirements is optional, if you're witty or wealthy enough to work around them.\n\nWhile the two businessmen-turned-politicians share a love of expensive cars -- and legal histories that include workplace lawsuits, undisclosed settlements, and attacks on judges -- they didn't always see eye to eye. In 2016 Moreno called Trump a \"maniac\" and said, \"There's no scenario in which I would support Trump.\" In 2021, he said Trump deserved \"lots and lots of blame\" for the January 6 attack on the Capitol. But Moreno didn't hold a grudge. In 2022, his daughter married Max Miller -- a former Trump aide who's now an Ohio congressman -- at Trump's New Jersey golf club. Six months later, Moreno donated $100,000 to Trump's super-PAC. Nine months after that, Trump backed Moreno in a GOP primary packed with competitors who local party officials believed would be stronger candidates. \"I wear with honor my endorsement from President Trump,\" he said in March, just after trouncing them all.\n\nMoreno represents Trump's takeover of the party in more ways than one. Once he favored pathways to legalization for undocumented immigrants; today he supports Trump's mass deportation scheme. Once he backed LGBTQ rights, noting that Modern Family helped him understand his gay son; today, he's accused LGBTQ rights advocates of advancing a \"radical\" agenda of \"indoctrination,\" according to the Associated Press, which recently reported that someone using Moreno's work email created a profile seeking gay sex on a dating site in 2008. (His staff blamed a former intern -- one who gave his campaign more than $6,500 last year.) Moreno, who once bemoaned the homogeneity of Cleveland-area boardrooms and claimed he benefited from diversity initiatives as a Colombian immigrant, now pledges to \"end wokeness.\"\n\nMoreno's contest with incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown -- whom he derides as an \"old commie\" -- is key to Democrats' hopes of holding the Senate. Brown, who lambastes rich executives for decimating American manu\u00adfacturing, union jobs, and the middle class, has a slight polling lead and a long alliance with organized labor; he rallied with United Auto Workers strikers last fall across Ohio as they won major concessions. But none of that has stopped Moreno from claiming he'd be the best advocate for Ohio workers; after all, as he said in a primary debate, he's \"employed thousands\" of them.\n\nBut Moreno's record as a boss could prove to be a liability. \"For him to come out now and say that he's this champion of working-class people -- he's a liar, and we call out liars,\" says Tony Totty, president of UAW Local 14, which represents about 1,400 General Motors employees in northwest Ohio.\n\nIn February 2015, Omar Adem was hired to sell Mercedes-Benzes at a Moreno dealership in Burlington, Massachusetts. According to a complaint Adem later filed, sales team members were regularly required to stay after shifts and report in on days off. But Moreno's company, according to Adem's complaint, refused to pay overtime if they earned commissions that matched or exceeded what they were owed. In November 2022, a judge ordered Adem and another employee be paid $416,160 in damages after a jury found both the dealership and Moreno individually liable for shorting pay.\n\nIn court, Moreno initially defended the pay practices, saying he acted in good faith and \"committed no violation of law.\" But during the trial, he was forced to admit to shredding overtime-\u00adpayment records -- documents the judge ruled he had been \"required to preserve\" and that he and his lawyers \"knew or should have known [were] relevant.\" On the campaign trail, Moreno has slammed that judge, a Republican appointee, as a \"lunatic activist.\" He has also assailed the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld the state's overtime rules in a related case, as \"liberal,\" even though five of its seven justices had been appointed by GOP Gov. Charlie Baker.\n\nBefore launching his 2024 run, Moreno settled more than a dozen other Massachusetts wage theft cases, all for undisclosed amounts. \"When you're stiffing workers out of their well-earned overtime pay, you're a fraud,\" says Totty.\n\nWhile his campaign asserts that, \"as a proud minority businessman,\" Moreno has \"always been committed to giving opportunities to all of his workers, regardless of race, color, gender, or creed,\" several of his Ohio employees have alleged workplace bias and mistreatment. Cara Wilson, an Akron-area mother, sued Moreno for gender discrimination and wrongful termination after spending three months overhauling a \u00adstruggling Acura dealership. Her suit alleged that, unlike \"prior male managers,\" she was \"not permitted to make critical decisions\" yet was nonetheless \"blamed for the dealership's poor performance.\" Moreno told her she was \"a bad leader but a better mother,\" Wilson alleged, and another time angrily told her to \"put your kids in fucking daycare.\"\n\nIn June 2017, Ronell Thompson sued Moreno's companies alleging \"racially discriminatory pay practices\" at an Infiniti dealership. After Thompson complained a white colleague with a lower title earned as much as he did, he received repeated warnings about his own performance based on false data, according to his lawsuit, before being demoted, transferred, given a pay cut, and ultimately fired.\n\nIn a third lawsuit, 67-year-old Dolores Wolfe alleged she was treated differently \"based on her age.\" Her lawsuit says she had an award-winning sales record and that Moreno and his associates repeatedly agreed to promote her, but instead gave more senior titles and professional opportunities to \"younger, male employees.\" Eventually, Wolfe landed a job out of state and furnished a house there, her filing says, before Moreno flew in to meet her with a promise to promote her and pay her more if she stayed. Her complaint says she called off her move, but Moreno \"never provided\" a new position.\n\nMoreno settled these cases for undisclosed amounts, and now calls two of these three plaintiffs -- none of whom responded to requests to comment -- close friends; Wilson even hosted a fundraiser for the boss she once sued.\n\nHe can afford to be generous. Born into a politically powerful Bogot\u00e1 family with what Cleveland.com called \"lavish generational wealth,\" Moreno became one of the largest luxury car dealers in the Midwest. When he sold off most of his dealerships in 2019, he likely made \"a couple hundred million bucks,\" according to Automotive News. Public filings show he's currently worth between $25 million and $100 million, including a stake in Dryver, a chauffeuring app.\n\nAs for the Vulcan, Moreno's Aston Martin dealership put it up for sale in 2016 for $3.4 million -- 90 times what the average Ohio worker makes each year. It's unclear what Moreno is driving these days, but Brown can be found behind the wheel of a Jeep Cherokee -- assembled in Toledo by UAW members.", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType":

We shipped it in as car parts.\"\n\nMother Jones recently profiled Moreno, the GOP hopeful challenging Ohio incumbent Democratic Sen.

Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is running a deceitful ad tying his Republican opponent in Ohio's Senate race, Bernie Moreno, to the idling of a General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown in 2019.\n\nOn the contrary, Moreno, a successful auto dealer, actually proposed a plan that would have kept the plant's doors open for up to another five years, the Detroit Free Press reported.\n\n\"Bernie Moreno proposed a real solution to continue one of the most essential and high-quality plants in General Motors' network and save thousands of jobs,\" Moreno campaign spokeswoman Reagan McCarthy said in a statement to Breitbart News. \"Career politician Sherrod Brown's repeat lies to cover up a Biden-aligned record that has cost Ohio jobs is why voters will retire him in November.\"\n\nBrown's campaign posted the video to his X account on Thursday. In it, a former autoworker said, \"Want to see the cost of Bernie Moreno's lies? It's an empty plant in Lordstown.\"\n\nThe worker went on to say, \"The Chinese cars Bernie Moreno sold are the same cars that led to our plant being shut down,\" and he contended that Moreno did not stand up for autoworkers when he was a car dealer. The vehicle in question was the Buick Envision, according to a Spectrum News article cited in the ad.\n\nHowever, per Detroit Free Press auto industry reporter Jamie L. LaReau in 2019, Moreno was behind a plan that \"would have kept General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, running possibly up to five more years,\" involving a vision for Chevrolet Cruzes: \"He wanted to buy 150,000 to 180,000 Cruze cars to start a global ride-hailing company similar to Uber, various sources say. The company would buy the cars from GM and own the fleet of cars along with employing drivers, say sources.\"\n\nIn November 2018, GM revealed that five North American facilities, including the Lordstown plant, would be idled. The next month, Moreno reportedly engaged in meetings about the plan, which would have kept the factory operating. However, LaReau wrote that \"GM CEO Mary Barra rejected the deal, sealing the plant's fate when the last Cruze rolled off the line\" in March 2019.\n\nOne local union leader estimated that the deal could have preserved some 3,000 jobs at the plant.\n\nWhat is more, Moreno stopped selling GM Envisions because of the plant's closure. McCarthy told Spectrum News that he decided to \"stop any new inventory of Envision's from being sold at his dealership\" in response to the plant's closure, which is supported by email screenshots from the time reported by the outlet.\n\nThe attack on Moreno comes as the Republican has hammered Brown over the substantial loss of \"200,000 manufacturing jobs\" in Ohio since Brown began serving in Congress.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_gilbertson@breitbart.com", "name": "Nick Gilbertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordstown,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lordstown, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lordstown, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Cruze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Cruze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Envision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buick Envision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Barra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Barra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Plants", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Plants", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/05/Bernie-Moreno-and-Sherrod-Brown.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669473", "eventUri": "eng-9669473", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 1758, "textEnd": 1771}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textStart": 2118, "textEnd": 2128}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Sherrod Brown tells Ohio voters not to trust GOP 'car salesman'...", "body": "Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is repeatedly running ads urging Ohioans not to vote for a \"car salesman\" -- while swimming in Big Auto donations himself.\n\nThe campaign commercial has been ubiquitous in the state since May, and all it does is show a man, Republican Bernie Moreno, who happens to sell cars for a living at work -- selling cars.\n\n\"As a car salesman, Bernie Moreno would say anything to sell a car,\" the ad begins before quoting old ads with Moreno saying things such as \"We offer excellent sales guarantees\" and \"52 car washes a year.\"\n\nA voice intones, \"You couldn't trust him as a car dealer. So why would you trust him as your senator?\"\n\nViewers may expect some damning line or strange contradiction from Moreno in the ad -- but no.\n\nHe's just selling cars. He's just doing his job.\n\nThe ad's implication? Ohioans should not vote for Moreno because of his profession.\n\nBut while the Brown campaign may not fully trust the auto business, it sure has benefited from it.\n\nAccording to campaign-finance disclosures:\n\nBrown, previously a fierce opponent of PACs, recently recanted his vow never to take money from one, made while attempting to mount a presidential run that ultimately fizzled.\n\n\"This is a pattern for Brown,\" a senior Republican strategist said. \"For years he's cultivated this image as an honest, pro-worker candidate . . . but taking all this [PAC] money certainly makes that much tougher for people to believe.\"\n\n\"Sherrod Brown, a 50-year career politician, is who Ohio voters should distrust. His despicable ad mocking auto dealers and their tens of thousands of hardworking employees is wildly out-of-touch,\" Moreno said after seeing Brown's ad. The senator \"owes a sincere apology to thousands of hardworking Ohioans for this disgusting, cheap insult.\"\n\nMoreno's fellow salespeople and auto dealers around the state expressed their own outrage, which his campaign circulated.\n\n\"Sherrod Brown has never had a job outside of government and has no idea what it takes. He should apologize to all of us for these despicable comments,\" said Joseph Chapman of Marysville's Chapman Ford.\n\n\"Sherrod Brown's latest ad is as out of touch as a politician can be,\" said David Wyler of Jeff Wyler Automotive Family in Winchester's. \"His comments are insulting to the hundreds of thousands of hardworking employees who work for auto dealers.\"\n\nAsked to confirm or deny taking donations from auto-manufacturer PACs and whether he considers blue-collar workers to make good leaders, Brown's campaign responded: \"No one has fought harder for Ohio auto workers than Sherrod Brown -- who is making sure more cars are made in America, and especially in Ohio, by Ohio workers.\"\n\nThe campaign noted Moreno's record is far from spotless, highlighting a Spectrum News report that found Moreno repeatedly lied about refusing to sell the Buick Envision -- an SUV manufactured in China -- at any of his dealerships.\n\nAuto-futurism is a key issue for Brown, who is one of a very small number of Democratic senators yet to embrace his party's eagerness to hasten America's transition from gas- to electric-powered vehicles.\n\nPolls show Brown leads Moreno by as many as 5 points -- a recent boost many attribute to a steady stream of contradictions the Democrat has highlighted from the Republican's early campaign literature, such as the details of his childhood and immigration from Columbia.\n\nBrown has already spent more than $48.1 million on campaigns ads, according to the real-time advertising-analytics tracker Ad Impact Politics.\n\nThat's more than any other sitting senator has spent so far this election cycle.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"id": 232045680, "title": "Ten Taboo Topics Dividing Psychologists", "text": "Psychology \ufffd and the social sciences more broadly \ufffd seem to be riven with discord of late. Stories abound of censorship, self-censorship, deplatforming, and suppression of uncomfortable findings. Is academic freedom truly at risk? Is ideology supplanting the scientific method in the \"soft\" sciences? And exactly what topics are splitting the social sciences asunder? In a recently published study, a team of social scientists explored these pressing questions. The group's work began in early 2021. The team interviewed 41 scholars with PhDs in psychology or related disciplines to identify taboo research conclusions dividing social scientists. \"Overwhelmingly, the most taboo conclusions involved genetic, evolutionary, biological, or otherwise natural explanations for group differences in socially important outcomes, particularly in domains in which women underperform relative to men or Black people underperform relative to White people,\" the interviewers found. The most taboo conclusions were: 1. \ufffdThe tendency to engage in sexually coercive behavior likely evolved because it conferred some evolutionary advantages on men who engaged in such behavior.\ufffd2. \ufffdGender biases are not the most important drivers of the under-representation of women in STEM fields.\ufffd3. \ufffdAcademia discriminates against Black people (e.g., in hiring, promotion, grants, invitations to participate in colloquia/symposia).\ufffd4. \ufffdBiological sex is binary for the vast majority of people.\ufffd5. \ufffdThe social sciences (in the United States) discriminate against conservatives (e.g., in hiring, promotion, grants, invitations to participate in colloquia/symposia).\ufffd6. \ufffdRacial biases are not the most important drivers of higher crime rates among Black Americans relative to White Americans.\ufffd7. \ufffdMen and women have different psychological characteristics because of evolution.\ufffd8. \ufffdGenetic differences explain non-trivial (10% or more) variance in race differences in intelligence test scores.\ufffd9. \ufffdTransgender identity is sometimes the product of social influence.\ufffd 10. \ufffdDemographic diversity (race, gender) in the workplace often leads to worse performance.\ufffd In late 2021, the researchers sent out this list of topics to 4,603 psychology faculty at some of the top academic institutions in the United States. Faculty were asked to review the conclusions and take an anonymous survey. Chiefly, they were asked to rate their confidence in the truth or falsity of each statement, from 0 to 100. They were also asked various other questions to gauge their opinions on freedom of speech in the social sciences. Roughly one in ten psychological professors responded to the survey. Broadly speaking, there was scant consensus on any of the taboo topics, though academics tended to acknowledge that biological sex is binary (66.1% average confidence) and that men and women have evolved psychological sex differences (65.5%). They also generally disagreed with the notion that demographic diversity worsens performance in the workplace (21.4% confidence) and that genetics accounts for significant differences in IQ (29.1% confidence). Despite the lack of consensus on the taboo topics, the psychologists surveyed generally agreed that scholars should be completely free to pursue research questions without fear of institutional punishment and that scientific truth should take precedence over social-equity goals. A slim majority of professors (52.3%) reported that scholars should be completely free to pursue research questions without fear of institutional punishment for their conclusions. By contrast, 1.6% said scholars should not have this freedom, and 46.0% said it\ufffds complicated. A slim majority of professors (56.5%) reported that scientists should prioritize truth when truth and social-equity goals come into conflict. By contrast, 3.1% prioritized social equity over truth, and 40.5% said it\ufffds complicated. Refreshingly, there was scant support for taking actions against scholars who draw taboo conclusions. Just one in five of those surveyed supported disinviting them from talks and one in ten said that their work shouldn't be published. The findings suggest that, despite wide disagreement amongst prominent psychologists on various controversial topics, belief in academic freedom remains fairly strong, even if it isn't loudly articulated.

But it is losing steam. On the second day, it just marked minimal collections. For two days, it clocked Rs 55 crore share out of Rs 95 crore gross collections being circulated around,\u201d he says and adds, \u201cMany theaters in Rajahmundry, Vizag, Kurnool and Nizamabad and other major centres are having tough time in draw big crowds,\u201d he adds.He claims that Prabhas crowd-pulling prowess is tested once again and box office figures that are floated around are a mix of GST (18 % added) and gross collections (40 to 45% needs to be deducted) and other components. \u201cSome distributors are flashing big numbers and are trying to woo audiences to recover their investments. Actually, distributor share for the last two days is stuck around Rs Rs 55 crore plus without GST and gross collections. It has dented Prabhas crowd pulling prowess a bit,\u201d he adds.With a hard core mass audience in B & C centres failing to turn up in big numbers, the sci-fi action adventure is finding it hard to garner big collections since Prabhas role wasn\u2019t exciting enough for his fans to jump in joy. \u201cFans expected Prabhas to be the protagonist who will lead from the front, but it got diluted and missed its target and collections too,\u2019 he concludes.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/kalki-collections-decline-in-andhra-and-telangana-garners-rs-55-cr-share", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/29/1100363-kalki962024m2.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:48:12", "author": "BVS Prakash", "authors": ["BVS Prakash"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.519}

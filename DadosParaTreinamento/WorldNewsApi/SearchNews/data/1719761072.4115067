According to nutritionist Dr Terry Shintani, who claims he has been \u201creversing chronic diseases for over thirty years\u201d, says that research conducted over the years suggests eating \u201csoy foods at least once a week had a 17% lower risk of heart attack and 18% lower risk of stroke that those who didn't.\u201d View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dr. Terry Shintani (@drshintaniforyourhealth) Debunking the claim with research inputs \u201cWhile soy foods can contribute to cardiovascular health, evidence supporting the claim that consuming them once a week significantly reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke is not robust,\u201d says Shubha Ramesh L, chief dietician at DHEE Hospitals. She further elaborates on this: Isoflavones and Cardiovascular Health: Isoflavones, the phytoestrogens in soy, have been studied for their potential cardiovascular benefits. A review published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition indicated that isoflavones could improve arterial function and lower blood pressure. However, the evidence is mixed, and not all studies have found significant benefits. Soy Protein and Cholesterol: The FDA recognises that 25 grams of soy protein daily can help lower cholesterol levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease. This was based on studies showing a modest reduction in LDL cholesterol. However, more recent reviews and meta-analyses, such as one published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggest that the cholesterol-lowering effect of soy is relatively modest compared to other interventions. Frequency of Consumption: Consuming soy once a week might not be enough to achieve significant cardiovascular benefits. The beneficial effects observed in studies typically involve daily consumption of soy products, amounting to around 25 grams of soy protein per day. Amount of soy required to see the benefits Shubha reveals, \u201cTo achieve the cholesterol-lowering benefits recognised by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an individual would need to consume about 25 grams of soy protein per day. This could be equivalent to about two servings of soy foods, such as a cup of soy milk and a serving of tofu or tempeh.\u201d Consuming soy foods in such quantities daily can be productive if incorporated into a balanced diet. However, she informs that the benefit depends on overall dietary habits and lifestyle. Critical analysis and alternatives Shubha reveals, \u201cA meta-analysis published in Circulation highlighted that while soy protein has a modest effect on lowering LDL cholesterol, the impact is less than previously thought. The cardiovascular benefits of soy may also depend on the individual's overall diet and lifestyle.\u201d Genetic factors might influence how effectively individuals metabolise isoflavones, she states. Research suggests variability in the cardiovascular response to soy based on genetic makeup, which means not everyone will experience the same benefits. Other foods and dietary patterns, such as those high in soluble fibre (e.g., oats, barley), plant sterols, and healthy fats (e.g., nuts, olive oil), have been shown to effectively lower cholesterol and improve heart health. These alternatives might offer similar or greater benefits compared to soy. Potential risks and considerations Shubha warns everyone to consider the following risks before adopting a diet rich in soy foods: Allergies and Hormonal Effects: Some individuals are allergic to soy, and there are concerns about the hormonal effects of isoflavones, particularly in individuals with thyroid conditions or hormone-sensitive cancers. However, moderate consumption is generally considered safe for most people. Processing and Additives: Highly processed soy products, such as soy protein isolates found in some protein bars and shakes, might not offer the same health benefits as whole soy foods and could contain additives and preservatives that are less desirable.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/soy-foods-heart-attack-stroke-health-nutrition-diet-food-9349157/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/soy-foods.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:00:31", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.147}

However, earthquakes east of the mountain range \"are typically felt over a much wider area than earthquakes of comparable magnitude to the west.\"\n\n\"East of the Rockies, the earthquake could be felt over an area 10 times larger than a similar earthquake on the West Coast,\" the USGS said. \"It would not be unusual for a magnitude 4.0 earthquake in eastern or central North America to be felt by a large percentage of the population in many communities more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from its source.\"\n\nIs Illinois on a fault line?\n\nThe USGS notes that scientists who study earthquakes in eastern and central North America \"often work on the hypothesis that modern earthquakes are the result of slippage on pre-existing faults that formed in earlier geologic times and have been reactivated under present-day stress conditions.\"\n\nAccording to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Office of Homeland Security, Illinois is \"at risk from two major seismic zones,\" including the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone and the New Madrid Seismic Zone.\n\n\"The Wabash Valley region is located between southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana,\" the bureau said. \"The Wabash Valley region is located in the central Mississippi Valley and includes parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee. Over any 50-year period, there is a 25% to 40% chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater occurring in this seismic zone.\"\n\nMost of Illinois' earthquakes occur in the southern half of the state near the famous New Madrid fault line. This fault system has caused some of the most powerful earthquakes in U.S. history, temporarily reversing the flow of the Mississippi River and causing tremors felt as far away as Washington, D.C.\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are fault systems in northern Illinois as well, including the \"Sandwich Fault Zone\" that runs from DeKalb to Dixon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nAnother fault known as the Peruvian Monoclinic Fault runs from Dixon to the southeast and crosses the western parts of LaSalle County.\n\nThere is a fault zone north of Chicago in the area known as the Des Plaines Fault Zone, but that area has not caused significant seismic activity.\n\nWhen was the last earthquake in Illinois?\n\nOn average, Illinois experiences five earthquakes a year, but experts say we don't usually feel them.\n\nIn March, Illinois experienced a magnitude 2.8 earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake was recorded north of Germantown, Illinois, a small town in Clinton County, part of the Metro East area outside St. Louis.\n\nIn 2023, the state experienced two earthquakes, according to officials: One was a \"mild\" 3.2-magnitude quake in southern Illinois. The other was a 3.6-magnitude quake, which was rated as the strongest to hit northern Illinois in years.\n\nWhen was the strongest earthquake in Illinois?\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the USGS reported a magnitude 3.6 earthquake at 4:42 a.m. Wednesday with its epicenter in Standard, Illinois.\n\nStandard is located in Putnam County, about 100 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nAccording to a quake map compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, residents of Ottawa, Streeter, Pontiac and Springfield may have felt the impact. Some residents of Aurora and DeKalb County also reported feeling the impact.\n\nThis earthquake turned out to be the strongest to hit northern Illinois in years.\n\nThe title of the strongest earthquake in the northern part of the state belongs to Lockport, which recorded a 5.1 magnitude quake in May 1909.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, this is the only earthquake ever recorded in Will County.\n\nIn total, only eight earthquakes were recorded in the Chicago area:\n\nMay 26, 1909: Magnitude 5.1 earthquake 3 km W of Lockport. (Will County)\n\nJanuary 2, 1912: 4.5 magnitude earthquake 2 km west of Lisbon. (Kendall County)\n\nSeptember 9, 1985: A magnitude 3.0 earthquake struck 3 km south of Lombard. (Dupage County)\n\nFebruary 10, 2010: 3.8 magnitude earthquake 2 km NW of Lily Lake (Qin County)\n\nJanuary 31, 2012: A magnitude 2.3 earthquake struck 1 km southwest of Lakemore. (Lake, McHenry)\n\nJune 10, 2013: A magnitude 2.6 earthquake struck 4 km NE of Virgil. (Kane County)\n\nNovember 4, 2013: A 3.2 magnitude earthquake struck 1 km south of Lyons. (Cook County)\n\nMarch 25, 2015: A magnitude 2.9 earthquake struck 3 km WNW of Lake Hills.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage.\n\nThe quake's epicenter was 45 kilometers (28 miles) southeast of San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, a tourist hub on the edge of the northern desert. The quake's depth was 117 kilometers (72 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which likely underestimated its magnitude. The deeper an earthquake is when it strikes, the less destructive the tremors are at the surface.\n\nChilean President Gabriel Boric said his government was closely examining the area but \"so far there are no reports of injuries or serious damage.\" The quake did not trigger a tsunami warning.\n\nFootage circulated online showing rocks falling on a highway linking the cities of Calama and Tocopila, east of the quake's epicenter, and local authorities reported roadblocks in the area.\n\nExperts say tremors from deep earthquakes are usually felt over a wider area of land. Chile's emergency service said Thursday's quake struck six provinces: Tarapac\u00e1, Antofagasta, Atacama, Coquimbo, Arica and Parinacota. At least a dozen aftershocks have hit the ground since then.\n\n\"Despite its enormous size and the large number of falling objects, it is not considered a very intense earthquake,\" said researchers at the Chilean Geoscience Network, a non-governmental organization, noting \"some minor shocks to infrastructure\" but no buildings falling. \"It was not difficult for the population to stand,\" they added.\n\nChile lies on the so-called Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" and is unusually prone to earthquakes. Chileans still have painful memories of an 8.8 magnitude earthquake in 2010 that triggered a tsunami and killed 526 people.\n\nThe Earth Science Network said Thursday's quake was the strongest to hit Chile since 2016, when a 7.6-magnitude quake struck the south of the country.\n\nThe Canadian Press.

While there were no reports of damage, the quake may have been felt in parts of the Chicago area in the western suburbs, including Yorkville and Oswego.\n\nThe Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of Homeland Security said Illinois is \"at risk from two major seismic zones,\" including the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone and the New Madrid Seismic Zone.\n\n\"The Wabash Valley region is located between southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana,\" the bureau said. \"The Wabash Valley region is located in the central Mississippi Valley and includes parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee. Over any 50-year period, there is a 25% to 40% chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater occurring in this seismic zone.\"\n\nMost of Illinois' earthquakes occur in the southern half of the state near the famous New Madrid fault line. This fault system has caused some of the most powerful earthquakes in U.S. history, temporarily reversing the flow of the Mississippi River and causing tremors felt as far away as Washington, D.C.\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are fault systems in northern Illinois as well, including the \"Sandwich Fault Zone\" that runs from DeKalb to Dixon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nAnother fault known as the Peruvian Monoclinic Fault runs from Dixon to the southeast and crosses the western parts of LaSalle County.\n\nThere is a fault zone north of Chicago in the area known as the Des Plaines Fault Zone, but that area has not caused significant seismic activity.\n\nWhen was the last earthquake in Illinois?\n\nOn average, Illinois experiences five earthquakes a year, but experts say we don't usually feel them.\n\nIn March, Illinois experienced a magnitude 2.8 earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake was recorded north of Germantown, Illinois, a small town in Clinton County, part of the Metro East area outside St. Louis.\n\nIn 2023, the state experienced two earthquakes, according to officials: One was a \"mild\" 3.2-magnitude quake in southern Illinois. The other was a 3.6-magnitude quake, which was rated as the strongest to hit northern Illinois in years.\n\nWhen was the strongest earthquake in Illinois?\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the USGS reported a magnitude 3.6 earthquake at 4:42 a.m. Wednesday with its epicenter in Standard, Illinois.\n\nStandard is located in Putnam County, about 100 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nAccording to a quake map compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, residents of Ottawa, Streeter, Pontiac and Springfield may have felt the impact. Some residents of Aurora and DeKalb County also reported feeling the impact.\n\nThis earthquake turned out to be the strongest to hit northern Illinois in years.\n\nThe title of the strongest earthquake in the northern part of the state belongs to Lockport, which recorded a 5.1 magnitude quake in May 1909.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, this is the only earthquake ever recorded in Will County.\n\nIn total, only eight earthquakes were recorded in the Chicago area:\n\nMay 26, 1909: Magnitude 5.1 earthquake 3 km W of Lockport. (Will County)\n\nJanuary 2, 1912: 4.5 magnitude earthquake 2 km west of Lisbon. (Kendall County)\n\nSeptember 9, 1985: A magnitude 3.0 earthquake struck 3 km south of Lombard. (Dupage County)\n\nFebruary 10, 2010: 3.8 magnitude earthquake 2 km NW of Lily Lake (Qin County)\n\nJanuary 31, 2012: A magnitude 2.3 earthquake struck 1 km southwest of Lakemore. (Lake, McHenry)\n\nJune 10, 2013: A magnitude 2.6 earthquake struck 4 km NE of Virgil. (Kane County)\n\nNovember 4, 2013: A 3.2 magnitude earthquake struck 1 km south of Lyons. (Cook County)\n\nMarch 25, 2015: A magnitude 2.9 earthquake struck 3 km WNW of Lake Hills.

However, earthquakes east of the mountain range are \"typically felt over a much broader region than earthquakes of similar magnitude in the west.\"\n\n\"East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area more than ten times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the west coast,\" the USGS said. \"It would not be unusual for a magnitude 4.0 earthquake in eastern or central North America to be felt by a significant percentage of the population in many communities more than 100 km (60 mi) from its source.\"\n\nThe USGS reports that scientists who study eastern and central North America earthquakes \"often work from the hypothesis that modern earthquakes occur as the result of slip on preexisting faults that were formed in earlier geologic eras and that have been reactivated under the current stress conditions.\"\n\nAccording to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of Homeland Security, Illinois is \"at risk from two major seismic zones,\" which include the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone and the New Madrid Seismic Zone.\n\n\"The Wabash Valley Zone is located between southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana,\" the office said. \"The NMSZ is located in the Central Mississippi Valley and includes portions of the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, and Tennessee. During any 50-year time span, there is a 25% to 40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquake in this seismic zone.\"\n\nMost of Illinois' earthquakes occur in the southern half of the state near the famed New Madrid fault line. That fault system has caused some of the strongest earthquakes in United States history, temporarily reversing the flow of the Mississippi River and causing tremors that were felt as far away as Washington, D.C.\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are fault systems in northern Illinois as well, including the 'Sandwich Fault Zone' running from DeKalb to Dixon, according to the USGS.\n\nAnother fault known as the Peru Monocline runs southeast from Dixon and across the western portions of LaSalle County.\n\nThere is a fault zone north of Chicago in an area known as the \"Des Plaines Fault Zone,\" but that area has not caused significant seismic activity.\n\nOn average, Illinois gets five earthquakes per year, but we don't typically feel them, experts say.\n\nIn March, Illinois saw a 2.8 magnitude earthquake, the USGS said. It was detected just north of Germantown, Ill., a small community located in Clinton County, part of the Metro East region outside of St. Louis.\n\nIn 2023, the state saw two earthquakes, according to officials: one was a \"light,\" 3.2 magnitude earthquake in Southern Illinois. The other was 3.6 magnitude quake, which ranked as the strongest Northern Illinois had seen in years.\n\nNov. 15, 2023, the USGS reported a 3.6 magnitude earthquake occurred at 4:42 a.m. Wednesday with an epicenter in Standard, Ill.\n\nStandard in Putnam County, is approximately 100 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nAccording to a USGS map of the quake, residents in Ottawa, Streator, Pontiac and Springfield may have felt the impact. Additionally, some in Aurora and DeKalb County also reported feeling the impact, the USGS said.\n\nIt turned out to be the strongest earthquake northern Illinois had seen in years.\n\nThe title for the strongest earthquake in the northern part of the state belongs to Lockport, which recorded a magnitude-5.1 quake in May 1909.\n\nAccording to the USGS, that earthquake is the only one ever recorded in Will County.\n\nIn all, only eight earthquakes have ever been recorded in the Chicago area:\n\nMay 26, 1909: 5.1-magnitude quake 3 kilometers west of Lockport. (Will County)\n\nJan. 2, 1912: 4.5-magnitude quake 2 kilometers west of Lisbon. (Kendall County)\n\nSept. 9, 1985: 3.0-magnitude quake 3 kilometers south of Lombard. (DuPage County)\n\nFeb. 10, 2010: 3.8-magnitude quake 2 kilometers northwest of Lily Lake (Kane County)\n\nJan. 31, 2012: 2.3-magnitude quake 1 kilometer southwest of Lakemoor. (Lake, McHenry)\n\nJune 10, 2013: 2.6-mangitude quake 4 kilometers northeast of Virgil. (Kane County)\n\nNov. 4, 2013: 3.2-magnitude quake 1 kilometer south of Lyons. (Cook County)\n\nMarch 25, 2015: 2.9-magnitude quake 3 kilometers west-northwest of Lake in the Hills. (McHenry County)\n\nThe strongest earthquake ever recorded that was centered in Illinois occurred in Nov. 1968, when a 5.3-magnitude quake was recorded near Norris City, in the southeastern part of the state.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey",

While no reports of damage occurred, some parts of the Chicago area in the western suburbs may have felt the quake, including Yorkville and Oswego.\n\nSomonauk, in DeKalb County, is approximately 35 miles west of Aurora.\n\nThe Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of Homeland Security says Illinois is \"at risk from two major seismic zones,\" which include the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone and the New Madrid Seismic Zone.\n\n\"The Wabash Valley Zone is located between southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana,\" the office said. \"The NMSZ is located in the Central Mississippi Valley and includes portions of the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, and Tennessee. During any 50-year time span, there is a 25% to 40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquake in this seismic zone.\"\n\nMost of Illinois' earthquakes occur in the southern half of the state near the famed New Madrid fault line. That fault system has caused some of the strongest earthquakes in United States history, temporarily reversing the flow of the Mississippi River and causing tremors that were felt as far away as Washington, D.C.\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are fault systems in northern Illinois as well, including the 'Sandwich Fault Zone' running from DeKalb to Dixon, according to the USGS.\n\nAnother fault known as the Peru Monocline runs southeast from Dixon and across the western portions of LaSalle County.\n\nThere is a fault zone north of Chicago in an area known as the \"Des Plaines Fault Zone,\" but that area has not caused significant seismic activity.\n\nOn average, Illinois gets five earthquakes per year, but we don't typically feel them, experts say.\n\nIn March, Illinois saw a 2.8 magnitude earthquake, the USGS said. It was detected just north of Germantown, Ill., a small community located in Clinton County, part of the Metro East region outside of St. Louis.\n\nIn 2023, the state saw two earthquakes, according to officials: one was a \"light,\" 3.2 magnitude earthquake in Southern Illinois. The other was 3.6 magnitude quake, which ranked as the strongest Northern Illinois had seen in years.\n\nNov. 15, 2023, the USGS reported a 3.6 magnitude earthquake occurred at 4:42 a.m. Wednesday with an epicenter in Standard, Ill.\n\nStandard in Putnam County, is approximately 100 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nAccording to a USGS map of the quake, residents in Ottawa, Streator, Pontiac and Springfield may have felt the impact. Additionally, some in Aurora and DeKalb County also reported feeling the impact, the USGS said.\n\nIt turned out to be the strongest earthquake northern Illinois had seen in years.\n\nThe title for the strongest earthquake in the northern part of the state belongs to Lockport, which recorded a magnitude-5.1 quake in May 1909.\n\nAccording to the USGS, that earthquake is the only one ever recorded in Will County.\n\nIn all, only eight earthquakes have ever been recorded in the Chicago area:\n\nMay 26, 1909: 5.1-magnitude quake 3 kilometers west of Lockport. (Will County)\n\nJan. 2, 1912: 4.5-magnitude quake 2 kilometers west of Lisbon. (Kendall County)\n\nSept. 9, 1985: 3.0-magnitude quake 3 kilometers south of Lombard. (DuPage County)\n\nFeb. 10, 2010: 3.8-magnitude quake 2 kilometers northwest of Lily Lake (Kane County)\n\nJan. 31, 2012: 2.3-magnitude quake 1 kilometer southwest of Lakemoor. (Lake, McHenry)\n\nJune 10, 2013: 2.6-mangitude quake 4 kilometers northeast of Virgil. (Kane County)\n\nNov. 4, 2013: 3.2-magnitude quake 1 kilometer south of Lyons. (Cook County)\n\nMarch 25, 2015: 2.9-magnitude quake 3 kilometers west-northwest of Lake in the Hills.

It replaces the old Richter scale.\n\nQuakes between 2.5 and 5.4 magnitude are often felt but rarely cause much damage, according to Michigan Tech. Quakes below 2.5 magnitude are seldom felt by most people.\n\nEarthquakes' sudden, rapid shaking can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. They can happen anywhere, but they're most common in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Puerto Rico and Washington, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIf an earthquake strikes, it's best to protect yourself right away. Here are tips from experts:\n\nThe best way to protect yourself during an earthquake is to drop, cover and hold on, officials say.\n\n\"Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy,\" officials say. \"If you're using a wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.\"\n\nBe sure to cover your head and neck with your arms, and crawl under a sturdy table if possible. If no shelter is available, crawl to an interior wall away from windows.\n\nOnce under a table, officials say you should hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it.\n\n\"There can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water lines, or downed power lines,\" officials say. \"Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake. Be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On if you feel an aftershock.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At precisely 2:53 a.m. local time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported the epicenter near Somonauk, a village approximately 64 miles west of Chicago. The early-morning tremor caught residents off guard, awakening many from their sleep.\n\nResidents in western Chicago suburbs, such as Aurora, reported experiencing weak to light shaking. Despite the noticeable tremors, the quake was not strong enough to cause significant damage. According to the USGS, earthquake damage typically does not occur until the magnitude reaches 4.0 or 5.0. However, factors such as the distance from the epicenter and the construction of buildings can influence the extent of damage. While the tremor was alarming for some, it served as a reminder of the Midwest's seismic activity. \"I felt my bed shake slightly,\" said one Aurora resident. \"It was enough to wake me up, but nothing was damaged.\"\n\nMonday's earthquake marks the first in Illinois to measure over a magnitude of 3.0 since December 2023. Although the Midwest is not typically associated with frequent seismic activity, Illinois has experienced its share of earthquakes. The state lies within the New Madrid Seismic Zone, a major seismic zone that extends into several Midwestern states.\n\nIllinois' seismic history includes notable quakes such as the 1968 magnitude 5.4 quake near Dale, which remains one of the strongest recorded in the state.

Here are tips from experts:\n\nThe best way to protect yourself during an earthquake is to drop, cover and hold on, officials say.\n\n\"Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy,\" officials say. \"If you're using a wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.\"\n\nBe sure to cover your head and neck with your arms, and crawl under a sturdy table if possible. If no shelter is available, crawl to an interior wall away from windows.\n\nOnce under a table, officials say you should hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it.\n\n\"There can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water lines, or downed power lines,\" officials say. \"Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake.

This earthquake was so powerful that it sent seismic waves that were felt as far as Metro Manila, located more than a hundred kilometers from the epicenter.\n\nOn the afternoon of July 16, 1990, a Monday, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck northern Luzon with an epicenter located near the town of Rizal in the province of Nueva Ecija. More than 1,500 individuals perished while infrastructure damage was estimated at more than 12 billion Philippine pesos (>USD 200 million).\n\nThe earthquake was generated by the Philippine Fault, feared by many as one that may produce an even larger magnitude earthquake in the future.\n\nIt is an active fault that can be traced for more than 1,200 kilometers from Bangui in Ilocos Norte to Mati in Davao Oriental, running along the longer north-south axis of the archipelago, passing through several islands including the entirety of Luzon, Masbate, Leyte and Mindanao, and the intervening seas.\n\nThis fault is subdivided into segments that are named depending on the location where these have been mapped. The section that generated the July 16, 1990 magnitude 7.8 earthquake is called the Digdig Fault segment, so named after the barangay/village of Digdig (now Joson) in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija, where the geomorphological manifestations of the fault are best preserved.\n\nThis earthquake produced a ground rupture, a deep crack into the earth created by the release of energy from the earthquake's focus located several kilometers underneath the surface (see photo), that was 125 kilometers long. The length of ground rupture is directly proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake - the larger the magnitude, the longer the ground rupture.\n\nOther segments of the Philippine Fault have also ruptured in the last 50 years, inflicting major destruction in the affected areas. On March 17, 1973, southern Luzon was struck by a magnitude 7.4 earthquake, whose epicenter was located in the Ragay Gulf, the body of water between the peninsulas of Bondoc and Bicol. More than 10 individuals were reported killed while infrastructure damage was estimated at more than one hundred million pesos.\n\nMore recently, the Masbate segment produced two major earthquakes within a period of only 17 years, a rather unusual phenomenon given the current state of knowledge in earthquake science. The island was struck by a magnitude 6.3 earthquake on February 15, 2003, then again by a magnitude 6.6 tremor on August 18, 2020. These two earthquakes are believed to have been generated by the same fault, the Masbate segment of the Philippine Fault, which is a very rare occurrence. Theoretically, a fault that breaks releasing stored energy (called strain), should take a considerable length of time, in the order of several hundreds or even thousands of years, to accumulate new strain before releasing it again to generate the next earthquake.\n\nFor the most recent activity of the Philippine Fault, two earthquakes of magnitudes 7.0 (July 27, 2022) and 6.4 (October 25, 2022) were generated by its branches in Abra, occurring within three months of each other and separated by epicentral locations of less than 20 kilometers. Infrastructure damage in both earthquakes was significant, with less than 20 casualties reported.\n\nDuring the July 16, 1990 earthquake, many areas located far away from the epicenter and the trace of the Digdig Fault sustained heavy damage nonetheless, proving that distance from the earthquake fault does not guarantee safety from seismic hazards.\n\nBaguio and Dagupan are both more than 80 km away from the epicenter, but these cities, while located far away from the epicenter, incurred numerous casualties and heavy infrastructure damage including collapsed buildings, bridges and ruptured roads.\n\nIn Baguio City, damage is believed to have been caused by strong ground shaking intensified by the elevation of this mountain city situated at around 1,500 meters above sea level. Imagine how a high-rise building would behave when the ground on which it is built is shaken - the lower floors would move almost in harmony with the ground, but the higher floors would sway more intensely.\n\nIn Dagupan City, infrastructure damage was mainly due to liquefaction, a natural process where saturated sandy material behaves like a liquid when shaken. Imagine scooping moist sand from the beach, putting several scoops into a pail, letting the wet sand settle until the surface dries up. Then start shaking the pail to simulate an earthquake. The surface starts to moisten because the water molecules in between the sand grains below are energized by the shaking and start to rise to the surface as they are now more mobile than the sand grains. When this happens, even a solid object (simulating a building) stuck into the sand will start sinking and tilting. The ground is said to lose its bearing capacity, and any building built on it no matter how sturdy, would fail.\n\nDagupan City is built on sandy material accumulated at the mouth of mighty river systems that include the Bued and Agno Rivers. These rivers and their tributaries deliver sediments from the Cordillera and Zambales mountain ranges. The ground underneath the city is continuously moistened by surrounding estuaries and its proximity to the Lingayen Gulf.\n\nRecently, I was witness to an effective disaster preparedness exercise when Category 5 Hurricane Beryl ravaged several Caribbean island-countries with the strength of more than 215 kilometer-per-hour winds coupled with extended torrential rains. In Jamaica, several days before the forecasted landfall on July 4, 2024, authorities went to work early in preparing for the arrival of the hurricane. No less than the prime minister went on national TV to warn citizens of the impending danger the hurricane would bring and to lay out the national strategy to mitigate casualties and damage.\n\nExcept for frontline agencies, work was suspended in government agencies and international organizations such as the United Nations. Curfew was enforced, everyone was told to stay sheltered, check points were set up for the non-law-abiding citizens. The populace was obedient. The hurricane passed, authorities reported only two dead - one by drowning, the other smashed by a fallen tree.\n\nDisasters from weather disturbances can be relatively well-managed, given the current advancements in atmospheric science and space technology, where hurricanes and typhoons can be tracked and their paths and landfall locations predicted.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not so (yet) for earthquakes. As such, earthquake resilience can best be achieved by preparing well in advance through what some refer to as structural preparedness. It involves knowing the conditions of the ground and the infrastructure in the places that one frequents - places of domicile and work, in particular.\n\nIs the ground prone to intense shaking that can lead to liquefaction? Are there steep and weak slopes around that are prone to landslides? Is it by the sea where tsunamis are expected? Are the buildings constructed according to code?\n\nTo paraphrase a famous quote: He who stays ready does not need to get ready. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news",

The Cascadia subduction zone stretches approximately 1,000 kilometers from northern California to Vancouver Island and is capable of generating earthquakes as large as magnitude 9 on the Richter scale, especially toward its northern end.\n\nResearchers say they know the \"big one\" is coming, but when should we expect it? Predicting when a big earthquake will strike is just a game of chance, scientists say.\n\nIt's like guessing which breath will make a balloon pop, says Ed Nissen, a researcher in earth and ocean sciences at the University of Victoria. Past experience can give you a sense of it, Nissen says, but no two breaths or balloons are the same. It's not an exact science.\n\n\"Tectonic stress builds up gradually along the faults, and eventually the stresses will overcome the friction and the fault will slip in the event of an earthquake,\" Nissen told CTVNews.ca via Zoom.\n\nScientists can't say when these pressures will be enough to cause a sudden slide, but they can produce rough estimates based on probabilities, Nissen said.\n\nWhen is a major earthquake expected?\n\nCamille Brion, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN), says the chance of a strong earthquake off the coast of British Columbia in the next 50 years is between 10 and 15 per cent, with the probability increasing over time.\n\n\"So, sometime in the next 200 years or so, there is likely to be a magnitude 9 or greater earthquake in Cascadia,\" Brion said, adding that scientists are able to make estimates like this based in part on data from previous large earthquakes along the fault.\n\nAccording to NRCAN, there have been 13 major earthquakes along Cascadia in the last 6,000 years, at a rate of one every 500 to 600 years. However, some have occurred as much as 200 years apart, while others have occurred as much as 800 years apart.\n\nThe last time this happened was more than 300 years ago, Nissen says.\n\n\"The next earthquake may not happen for a hundred years or even two hundred years,\" Nissen said. \"But it's also true to say it could happen tomorrow. It wouldn't be a big surprise.\"\n\nHow bad was the last \"big accident\"?\n\nDetails of the recent massive earthquake are \"very well known,\" Nissen said, thanks to oral histories from indigenous people living on Vancouver Island, as well as careful records in Japan.\n\nThe last major earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone occurred at 9 p.m. Pacific time on January 26, 1700. The National and Regional Survey says it was one of the largest earthquakes in the world, estimated to have measured 9 on the Richter scale.\n\nTo provide a sense of scale, Nissen said a magnitude 9 earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 7 earthquake, which NRCAN classifies as a \"major\" earthquake.\n\nThe 1700 earthquake collapsed the homes of the Cowichan people on Vancouver Island and caused numerous landslides, according to the Natural Disaster Monitoring Network of Canada. The quake was so strong that people could not stand, and it lasted long enough to make them sick.\n\nFog rises over the water outside the village of Anacla in Pashina Bay, British Columbia, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2015. The Canadian Press/Jonathan Hayward\n\nOn the west coast of Vancouver Island, a tsunami triggered by the earthquake completely destroyed the winter village of the Pashina Bay people, leaving no survivors. The tsunami swept across the Pacific Ocean, causing widespread destruction as far away as Japan, where recordings of the events allowed the precise time of the earthquake to be known.\n\nThe earthquake also left clear geological signatures consistent with the 12 other earthquakes that preceded it.\n\nWill there be any warning signs?\n\nNissen said there were unlikely to be any signs that a \"big earthquake\" was about to hit the area, because earthquakes happen suddenly.\n\n\"There is nothing fixed that can be reliably used as an indication that an earthquake will occur,\" he said.\n\nSome researchers see promise in studying the tremors that occur before some major earthquakes, but Nissen says even those tremors aren't reliable enough to rely on.\n\n\"It turns out that not every earthquake has a precursor. Most big earthquakes don't actually have a precursor,\" he said.\n\nFortunately, a new technology has emerged that can give people enough time, before the tremors start, to try to get to safety.\n\nBrion explained that earthquake early warning systems use special sensors to detect the first wave of energy radiated from an earthquake, the P wave.\n\n\"By knowing when the P wave arrives, we can quickly determine where the earthquake is, how strong it is, and then when the next shear waves, or S waves, will arrive at a certain point, and how strong the shaking will be,\" she added.\n\nWhile both types of seismic waves can cause vibrations, S waves are known to be more destructive.\n\nThe sensors transmit this information to data centers that use algorithms to determine the earthquake's location and magnitude, and an alert sometimes warns people in the area \"tens of seconds before\" shaking begins, according to NRCAN.\n\nCanada has developed an earthquake early warning system that is scheduled to be launched soon, Brion said, and ongoing efforts to enhance technology over the Cascadia Fault could give people more time to prepare, Nissen said.\n\n\"We're talking about 30 seconds before those seismic waves hit Vancouver Island ... or a little bit longer if you live in Vancouver, which is obviously to the east and further from the fault,\" Nissen said. Such a warning wouldn't prevent damage to buildings and other infrastructure, but it could save lives, he added.\n\n\"It's about giving people a few seconds to hide under the table or run outside if they have enough time...trains stopping safely, elevators getting to the nearest floor and doors opening, heart surgeons putting their instruments away, that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"The most dangerous section\"\n\nMeanwhile, a group of 20 researchers has obtained what they say is the most detailed imaging of the Cascadia subduction zone to date, providing valuable insight into how a massive earthquake might develop in the future.\n\nUsing a research vessel towing an array of geophysical instruments across almost the entire area, scientists have been able to produce what they say is the first comprehensive survey of the complex structure of the fault beneath the seafloor.\n\nThe team published its research in the scientific journal Science Advances last June.\n\nA couple walks along Whiffin Spit Park after a tsunami warning in Sooke, British Columbia, Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chad Hipolito\n\n\"The models currently used by public bodies have been based on a limited set of low-quality, legacy data dating back to the 1980s,\" said Susan Carbot, lead author and marine geophysicist at Columbia University, in a press release. \"The massive thrust has a more complex geometry than previously assumed. The study provides a new framework for assessing earthquake and tsunami risk.\"\n\nAmong the study's findings is that the northern part of the fault, near Vancouver Island and Washington state, is the section most likely to produce a major earthquake.\n\nWhile the terrain of the other parts is relatively rough, with features that may erode the upper plate and limit the extent of any earthquake propagation within the part, the northern part is smooth.\n\n\"This means it may be more likely to rupture along its entire length at one time, making it the most dangerous section,\" the press release said.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

According to the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), the earthquake had updated parameters with a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale.\n\n\"The epicenter of the earthquake was located at coordinates 1.30\u00b0 north latitude; 126.11\u00b0 east longitude, or more precisely in the sea at a distance of 110 km southeast of Bitung, North Sulawesi at a depth of 12 kilometers,\" BMKG's head of the earthquake and tsunami center, Daryono, said in a written statement on Wednesday, July 17, 2024.\n\nBased on BMKG data, the earthquake was strong enough to be felt as far away as Manado, Minahasa, North Minahasa, South Bolaang Mongondow, Bitung, Tomohon, Ternate, Sitaro, East Bolaang Mongondow with an intensity scale of III MMI.\n\n\"The modeling results show that this earthquake has no tsunami potential,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Daryono, based on the location of the epicenter and the depth of the hypocenter, the earthquake that occurred was a shallow type earthquake due to shallow rock deformation activity on the Maluku Sea Plate.\n\n\"The results of the source mechanism analysis show that the earthquake had an upward motion mechanism or thrust fault,\" Daryono said.\n\nAs of 07:10 Jakarta time, Daryono said that the BMKG monitoring results had not detected any aftershock activity.\n\nTEMPO.CO", "source": {"uri": "en.tempo.co", "dataType":

Could it happen again?", "body": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- The United States Geological Survey released a report at the beginning of this year looking at the risk of earthquakes around the country. The hazard map was colored in red along the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii, showing that these areas have the highest risk of earthquakes in the country.\n\nThe risk levels are lower in the middle of the country, except for one big red spot in the middle of the country -- in Missouri.\n\nThe town of New Madrid, which sits in the southeast corner of Missouri an hour away from Cape Girardeau, is home to fault lines where hundreds of unnoticeable earthquakes happen yearly, according to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.\n\nBut they might not always go unnoticed. The USGS says that the region has a 25%-40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 or higher earthquake happening in the next 50 years, and as much as a 10% chance of a repeat of the damaging quakes that happened more than 200 years ago. And governments are starting to prepare for the possibility.\n\nMissouri's earthquake history\n\nThe Missouri Department of Natural Resources reports that from Dec. 16, 1811, to Feb. 7, 1812, three major earthquakes believed to be magnitude 7.0 or greater occurred in what's now the New Madrid Seismic zone. These earthquakes were felt as far away as Louisville, Kentucky, and Cincinnati.\n\nThe earthquakes dropped the town of New Madrid 15 feet. Approximately 5,500 square miles, or about 3.5 million acres, of the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys were impacted by landslides, fissures, sandblows, lateral spreads, subsidence, submergence and uplift.\n\nSingle-story log buildings, which are an earthquake-resistant type of construction, shifted or sunk as parts of the areas submerged and flooded. Most of the area became unusable for the subsistence-type agriculture of that day.\n\nIs there a tectonic plate in Missouri?\n\nScientists say there aren't any tectonic plate boundaries in Missouri, but rather there are fault lines that can cause earthquakes. It's one of the things that makes the natural disaster happening in the region so odd, said Eric Sandvol, a seismologist at the University of Missouri.\n\n\"Most earthquakes occur at the edge of these plates, like in California where we find the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates,\" he said.\n\nBut faults are a tough area for researchers to study since the faults that produce earthquakes aren't easy to see at the surface in the region, the USGS says.\n\nThe faults that produce earthquakes in the New Madrid region have been eroded by river processes and buried 100 to 200 feet deep by river sediment.\n\nThe seismic zone is located in southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas, western Tennessee, western Kentucky and southern Illinois. Cities that are most likely to be affected include Memphis and St. Louis, as they are in the \"splash zone\" that could feel tremors.\n\nAn earthquake in this area can be more dangerous than what's recorded on the West Coast, the Missouri department said.\n\n\"Due to the nature of the bedrock in the earth's crust in the central United States, earthquakes in this region can shake an area approximately 20 times larger than earthquakes in California,\" the Missouri Department of Natural Resources said in a blog post.\n\nIt's not likely that Kansas City would suffer significant damage since the city is six hours away from New Madrid, but Sanoval said, that there's a possibility it could be felt within the city. It's documented that a bell was rang in Charleston, South Carolina, a 12-hour drive from New Madrid, as a result of the earthquake 200 years ago.\n\nWhat kind of damage could an earthquake do in Missouri?\n\nResearchers say you can't predict when an earthquake is coming, but they have estimations on the damage an earthquake could do in the New Madrid seismic zone.\n\nChris Cramer, a geophysicist who works on earthquake hazard at the Center for Earthquake Research and Information at the University of Memphis, spoke to Undark, a nonprofit science news organization about the potential cost. He estimated that a major earthquake near New Madrid would cost the U.S. an average of $10 billion a year for 100 years from damaged buildings and lost infrastructure\n\nThe main cause of damage and injuries during an earthquake is the destruction of manmade structures.. These structures are prone to damage, according to the state department:\n\n*Tall structures like buildings, bridges and dams\n\n*Large open structures like auditoriums, classrooms, factories, hospitals and churches\n\n*Brittle structures like unreinforced masonry buildings and unreinforced concrete\n\n*Complex structures with odd shapes and lots of corners\n\n*Unanchoredlarge objects in buildings like bookshelves, file cabinets, storage racks, pipes, fire sprinkler systems, water heaters and mechanical equipment.\n\nNational Guard task forces in the area of the New Madrid Fault in Missouri are training for an earthquake for the first time ever, according to Spectrum News in St. Louis. Cities in the seismic zone, like Memphis and St. Louis, have started to retrofit bridges in preparation. Newer buildings, especially taller ones, are built with shaking in mind, Undark says.\n\nUndark reports that states in the New Madrid seismic zone -- like Arkansas, Illinois and Kentucky -- only included earthquake provisions in their building codes in the early 2000s, meaning anything built prior to that is prone to collapse.\n\nIn Tennessee, jurisdictions can decide whether to opt in to building codes with earthquake provisions.\n\nIn contrast, Missouri doesn't have statewide building codes, although a bill was introduced this year to try and change that.", "source": {"uri":

These posts contain links to supposed references providing more information about the looming quake.\n\nOn the Facebook page \"Metro Headlines,\" a July 15 post contained a link after the text \"Mga lugar na dapat mag-ingat\" (places that should exercise caution). As of writing, it has 6,100 reactions, 1,600 comments, and 17,000 shares.\n\nThe facts: The links in the Facebook post are clickbait and do not lead to credible references about the supposed earthquake warning.\n\nThree posts from \"Metro Headlines\" link to products on e-commerce sites Shopee and Lazada, instead of the supposed list of danger zones or a source for the earthquake warning.\n\nOther Facebook posts with similar inaccurate links pointing to products from online selling platforms came from pages like \"Breaking News\" (July 15), \"Mayor Benjamin Magalong supporters\" (July 12), \"Trending Viral\" (July 12), \"trendnewsph\" (July 12 and June 28), \"Balitang Headline\" (June 30), and \"Surigao News Update\" (June 28).\n\nMagnitude 8 earthquake warning: The misleading Facebook posts falsely implied that the strong earthquake was imminent. Bacolcol indeed expressed the possibility of earthquakes stronger than magnitude 8 hitting the Philippines, but this should be placed in context: the Phivolcs director made the remarks following a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan last April. In this GMA News article dated April 4, 2024, Bacolcol explained that the Philippine Trench and Manila Trench are capable of generating magnitude 8.1 and magnitude 8.3 earthquakes, respectively.\n\nThe misleading posts cited Bacolcol to imply a prediction or forecast of a looming earthquake. However, Phivolcs has previously said that it is not yet possible to know when and where a future earthquake will hit.

Scientists weigh in", "body": "A \"swarm\" of earthquakes off the coast of British Columbia has forced many to remember something they'd probably rather forget: at any moment, the \"Big One\" could hit about 100 kilometres west of Vancouver Island.\n\nIn the context of Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the \"Big One\" refers to a megathrust earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate meets the North American tectonic plate. The Cascadia spans about 1,000 kilometres from Northern California to Vancouver Island and is capable of producing earthquakes as powerful as magnitude 9, especially toward its northern end.\n\nResearchers say they know the \"Big One\" is coming, but when should we expect it? Scientists say predicting when a megathrust earthquake will hit is a game of probability.\n\nIt's like guessing exactly which breath will be the one to make a balloon pop, says Ed Nissen, University of Victoria earth and ocean science researcher. Past experience might give you a feeling for it, Nissen said, but no two breaths, or balloons, are the same. It's not an exact science.\n\n\"The tectonic strain is kind of gradually building up along the faults, and eventually the stresses will overcome friction and the fault will slip in an earthquake,\" Nissen told CTVNews.ca in an interview over Zoom.\n\nNissen said scientists can't pinpoint exactly when those stresses will be enough to cause a sudden slip, but they can produce rough estimates based on probability.\n\nWhen is the big earthquake expected?\n\nCamille Brillon is a seismologist at Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) who says the probability of a megathrust quake off the coast of B.C. in the next 50 years is between 10 and 15 per cent, with the likelihood rising over time.\n\n\"So, sometime in the next 200-or-so years, there likely will be a (magnitude) 9+ Cascadia earthquake,\" Brillon said, adding that scientists are able to make estimates like this partly based on data from past megathrust quakes along the fault.\n\nAccording to NRCAN, 13 megathrust earthquakes have occurred along the Cascadia in the last 6,000 years, at an average rate of one every 500 to 600 years. However, some have been as close together as 200 years and some have been as far apart as 800 years.\n\nNissen says the last one was more than 300 years ago.\n\n\"The next one might not be for another 100 years or even 200 years,\" Nissen said. \"But it's also true to say it could happen tomorrow. It wouldn't be a huge surprise.\"\n\nHow bad was the last 'Big One'?\n\nThe details of the last megathrust quake are \"actually remarkably well known,\" Nissen said, thanks to the oral histories of Indigenous people living on Vancouver Island as well as accurate recordkeeping in Japan.\n\nThe last megathrust earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone occurred at 9 p.m. PT on Jan. 26, 1700. Estimated to have been a magnitude-9 quake, NRCAN says it was one of the world's largest.\n\nTo provide a sense of scale, Nissen said a magnitude-9 earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 7, the latter of which NRCAN classifies as a \"major\" earthquake.\n\nThe 1700 quake collapsed the houses of the Cowichan people on Vancouver Island and caused numerous landslides, according to NRCAN. The shaking was so violent that people couldn't stand, and it lasted long enough to make them sick.\n\nMist rises off the water outside the village of Anacla in Pachena Bay, B.C., Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2015. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward\n\nOn the west coast of Vancouver Island, a tsunami generated by the quake completely destroyed the winter village of the Pachena Bay people, leaving no survivors. The tsunami swept across the Pacific, causing destruction as far away as Japan, where recordkeeping made it possible to know the exact time of the quake.\n\nThe earthquake also left unmistakeable geological signatures consistent with the 12 other megathrust earthquakes before it.\n\nWill there be any warning signs?\n\nNissen said there probably won't be any telltale signs the \"Big One\" is about to hit, since earthquakes happen so abruptly.\n\n\"There's nothing consistent which you could reliably use as a signal that an earthquake is going to happen,\" he said.\n\nSome researchers see promise in studying the foreshocks that occur before some large earthquakes, but Nissen said even those aren't reliable enough to count on.\n\n\"It turns out not every earthquake has a foreshock,\" he said. \"Most big earthquakes actually don't.\"\n\nFortunately, a new technology has emerged that can buy people enough time, before the shaking starts, to try and get somewhere safe.\n\nEarthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems use special sensors to detect the first wave of energy that radiates from an earthquake, the P-wave, Brillon explained.\n\n\"Knowing when the P-wave arrives, we can quickly locate where the earthquake was, how big it was, and then when the following shear waves, or S-waves would reach a certain point, and how strong the shaking would be,\" she said.\n\nWhile both types of seismic waves can cause shaking, S-waves are known to be more destructive.\n\nSensors transmit this information to data centres that use algorithms to detect earthquake's location and magnitude, and an alert warns people in the area sometimes \"tens of seconds before\" shaking begins, according to NRCAN.\n\nCanada has developed an EEW system that Brillon said is due to launch imminently, and Nissen said ongoing efforts to bolster the technology over the Cascadia fault could give people even more time to prepare.\n\n\"We're talking about 30 seconds-ish before those seismic waves hit Vancouver Island ... a little bit longer if you live in Vancouver, which is obviously further to the east and further away from the fault,\" he said. Such a warning wouldn't prevent damage to buildings and other infrastructure, Nissen added, but it could save lives.\n\n\"This is about giving people a few seconds to get under a table or run outside if they have long enough ... trains to come to a safe halt, lifts coming to the closest floor and opening the doors, heart surgeons putting down their tools, that kind of thing.\"\n\n'The most dangerous section'\n\nMeanwhile, a group of 20 researchers has obtained what it says is the most detailed imaging of the Cascadia subduction zone yet, providing valuable insight into how a future megathrust earthquake might unfold.\n\nUsing a research vessel towing an array of geophysical instruments along almost the entire length of the zone, they produced what they say is the first comprehensive survey of the complex structure of the fault beneath the seafloor.\n\nThe team published its research in the scientific journal Science Advances in June.\n\nA couple walk along Whiffin Spit Park following a tsunami warning in Sooke, B.C., on Tuesday, January 23, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chad Hipolito\n\n\"The models currently in use by public agencies were based on a limited set of old, low-quality 1980s-era data,\" Suzanne Carbotte, lead author and a marine geophysicist at Columbia University, said in a media release. \"The megathrust has a much more complex geometry than previously assumed. The study provides a new framework for earthquake and tsunami hazard assessment.\"\n\nOne of the study's findings is that the northern part of the fault, close to Vancouver Island and Washington state, is the section most likely to produce a major earthquake.\n\nWhile the topography of other segments is relatively rough, with features that might erode the upper plate and limit how far any quake may spread within the segment, the northern portion is smooth.\n\n\"This means that it may be more likely to rupture along its entire length at once, making it potentially the most dangerous section,\" reads the media release.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Around 2:00 am on Dec. 16, 1811, New Madrid -- a small frontier settlement of 400 people on land now located in Missouri -- was jolted awake. Panicked townsfolk fled their homes as buildings collapsed and the smell of sulfur filled the air.\n\nThe episode didn't last long. But the worst was yet to come. Nearly two months later, after dozens of aftershocks and another massive quake, the fault line running directly under the town ruptured. Thirty-one-year-old resident Eliza Bryan watched in horror as the Mississippi River receded and swept away boats full of people. In nearby fields, geysers of sand erupted, and a rumble filled the air.\n\nIn the end, the town had dropped at least 15 feet. Bryan and others spent a year and a half living in makeshift camps while they waited for the aftershocks to end. Four years later, the shocks had become less common. At last, the rattled townspeople began \"to hope that ere long they will entirely cease,\" Bryan wrote in a letter.\n\nWhether Bryan's hope will stand the test of time is an open question.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey released a report in December 2023 detailing the risk of dangerous earthquakes around the country. As expected on the hazard map, deep red risk lines run through California and Alaska. But the map also sports a big bull's eye in the middle of the country -- right over New Madrid.\n\nThe USGS estimates that the region has a 25 to 40 percent chance of a magnitude 6.0 or higher earthquake in the next 50 years, and as much as a 10 percent chance of a repeat of the 1811-1812 sequence. While the risk is much lower compared to, say, California, experts say that when it comes to earthquake resistance, the New Madrid region suffers from inadequate building codes and infrastructure.\n\nCaught in this seismic splash zone are millions of people living across five states -- mostly in Tennessee and Missouri, as well as Kentucky, Illinois, and Arkansas -- including two major cities, Memphis and St. Louis. Mississippi, Alabama, and Indiana have also been noted as places of concern.\n\nIn response to the potential for calamity, geologists have learned a lot about this odd earthquake hotspot over the last few decades. Yet one mystery has persisted: why earthquakes even happen here in the first place.\n\nThis is a problem, experts say. Without a clear mechanism for why New Madrid experiences earthquakes, scientists are still struggling to answer some of the most basic questions, like when -- or even if -- another large earthquake will strike the region. In Missouri today, earthquakes are \"not as front of mind\" as other natural disasters, said Jeff Briggs, earthquake program manager for the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBut when the next big shake comes, \"it's going to be the biggest natural disaster this state has ever experienced.\"", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors":

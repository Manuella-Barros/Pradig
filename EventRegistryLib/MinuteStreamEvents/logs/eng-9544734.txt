A 3-3 game reached the Cardinals' bullpen, which has been the teams rocksteady presence through the offensive struggles, but all it took was one swing and the Mets got that swing. Nimmo's fourth home run of the season put the Mets ahead, and Mets relievers assured that it stayed that way. Edwin Diaz pitched an expedient ninth inning with two groundouts and a strike out to secure his fifth save and send the Cardinals to their third consecutive loss and their fifth in the past six games.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Washington University faculty placed on leave, students 'houseless' after Gaza protest Busch Stadium needs renovations.

They'll appear by early next week in the St. Louis area. Media Views: Battlehawks dominate spring football in attendance, but no longer in TV ratings BenFred: Here's why it just got harder to recruit against Eli Drinkwitz and Mizzou\n\nAt least it didn't take long.\n\nWith a pace set by Mets lefty Sean Manaea (2-1) and permitted by the Cardinals' pedestrian offense, the game was over in 2 hours, 24 minutes.\n\n\"Frustrating as can be,\" manager Oliver Marmol said of the lack of scoring.\n\nHe said that before the game.\n\nKyle Gibson allowed three runs (two earned) on seven hits through six innings. He struck out the first two batters of the game before allowing a first-inning run. An error complicated his fifth inning and allowed the Mets to take a 3-0 lead. That has been the Cardinals' outer limit for scoring over the past several weeks, and they got just that many with an answer in the sixth inning. The offense stalled from there and finished 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position. Over their past eight games they are 10 for 55 with runners in scoring position.\n\nFermin sparks rally\n\nUnable to do much or sustain anything for five innings against Mets lefty Manaea, the Cardinals stirred for their customary three runs in one, sixth-inning gulp.\n\nThe began from the top, with Jose Fermin.\n\nInfielder Fermin received his first ever start at leadoff hitter in the majors, as Marmol said before the game, because of the \"the quality of his at-bats.\" Fermin opened the game with a hotshot grounder down the third-base line that forced third baseman Brett Baty and umpire Doug Eddings to collide in foul territory. Fermin didn't need Eddings' pick and roll to arrive at first base safely. And that is also where the inning ended.\n\nThree Cardinals teammates failed to advance him from first.\n\nThings went better the next time Fermin reached base.\n\nHe threaded a single to left that put the game-tying rally in motion. Fermin's single was followed Willson Contreras' double to score Fermin and seize the Cardinals first run. A walk to Paul Goldschmidt and two quick flyouts brought the inning around to Ivan Herrera, the designated hitter against the lefty Manaea. Herrera drilled a pitch to the left-center gap and scored both of his teammates for a 3-3 game. Goldschmidt slid home ahead of the throw, and Herrera attempted to do the same at third. He was not as successful.\n\nThe tag applied to Herrera at third drew a replay challenge from the Cardinals, but officials in New York confirmed Eddings' call in real time.\n\nError allows Mets to widen lead\n\nIn all but one of his first six innings, Gibson had to sidestep a runner on base, and while the Mets did their fair share of threatening to increase the lead it wasn't until a misstep by the Cardinals that they did.\n\nAfter Jeff McNeil's leadoff single to start the fifth inning, leadoff hitter Brandon Nimmo lashed a line drive to right field. Right fielder Lars Nootbaar played the liner tight, and he either lost it in some glare or got handcuffed by the pace of the bounce. The ball got past him and all the way to the right field wall. That allowed both McNeil and Nimmo to advance a base, putting both into scoring position with no outs.\n\nBy the time Gibson got two outs, the Mets had two more runs.\n\nThey didn't make the most of the opportunity by turning it into a runaway inning, but they made sure they didn't let it pass without producing what the Cardinals offered with a couple of outs. A groundball to the right side brought home McNeil to double the Mets' lead, and Nimmo scored on a sacrifice fly to Nootbaar in right field, and that brought the Mets lead up to 3-0. One of the runs was unearned due to the error. Both could have been avoided.\n\nIt was unproductive, but also quick\n\nFor the first five innings of the Mets visit, the Cardinals lineup continued its seasonlong search for runs, but didn't waste much time coming up empty.\n\nWith a pace of game usually reserved for the Grapefruit League, Mets lefty Sean Manaea breezed through the Cardinals lineup with both swift and unproductive outs. On his 18th pitch of the game, Manaea got his fourth out, while Gibson needed 40 pitches to get his first six. It took Manaea 51 pitches to get the first 12 outs, and through the Cardinals' first 16 batters they had only two hits. It was a continuation of the lack of offense they had Sunday against the White Sox or this past week in Detroit or last month at home.\n\nJust quicker.\n\nManaea got help from McNeil with a diving catch in left-center field, and he got help from the Cardinals in other spots with runners in scoring position. Innings ended on soft line drives and groundouts with runners watching from second base at two-out doubles.\n\nThe Mets' lefty trimmed his ERA beneath 3.00 for a moment in the game before allowing the three runs. He struck out only one Cardinal in his six innings, but he was able to get quick-contact outs to limit them to the six hits, three of which came in the sixth inning.\n\nFoiled by former Cardinals\n\nA week that began with Jack Flaherty's 14 strikeouts and seven consecutive to start a game against his former team continued to find new ways for old Cardinals to play key roles against their former team. Former Cardinals All-Star Paul DeJong had two doubles and scored two runs in the White Sox win Sunday at Busch. Tommy Pham had an RBI for the Sox in their extra-inning win Saturday, and it was former Cardinals reliever John Brebbia with two key outs with the bases loaded in extra innings that allowed the Sox to win that game.\n\nOn Monday, with the Cardinals' former Gold Glove-winning center fielder Harrison Bader a midgame replacement for the Mets and a late-game double against his club, it was a first-round pick by the Cardinals, like Flaherty, who foiled them.\n\nAdam Ottavino pitched around a single in the eighth inning to preserve the Mets' one-run lead and carry it to one of the top closers in the game. Cue the trumpets.\n\nThe dirge continues.\n\n0 Comments Tags Pro-baseball St. Louis Cardinals Derrick Goold Cardinals Kyle Gibson Sean Manaea Harrison Bader Edwin Diaz", "source": {"uri":

But that is also where the inning ended.\n\nThree Cardinals teammates failed to advance him from first.\n\nThings went better the next time Fermin reached base.\n\nHe threaded a single to left that put the game-tying rally in motion. Fermin's single was followed Willson Contreras' double to score Fermin and seize the Cardinals' first run. A walk to Paul Goldschmidt and two quick fly outs brought the inning around to Ivan Herrera, the designated hitter against the lefty Manaea. Herrera drilled a pitch to the left-center gap and scored both of his teammates for a 3-3 game. Goldschmidt slid home ahead of the throw, and Herrera attempted to do the same at third. He was not as successful.\n\nThe tag applied to Herrera at third drew a replay challenge from the Cardinals, but officials in New York confirmed Eddings' call in real time.\n\nError allows Mets to widen lead\n\nIn all but one of his first six innings, Gibson had to sidestep a runner on base, and while the Mets did their fair share of threatening to increase the lead, it wasn't until a misstep by the Cardinals that they did.\n\nAfter Jeff McNeil's leadoff single to start the fifth inning, Nimmo lashed a line drive to right field. Right fielder Lars Nootbaar played the liner tight, and he either lost it in some glare or got handcuffed by the pace of the bounce. The ball got past him and all the way to the right field wall. That allowed both McNeil and Nimmo to advance a base, putting both into scoring position with no outs.\n\nBy the time Gibson got two outs, the Mets had two more runs.\n\nThey didn't make the most of the opportunity by turning it into a runaway inning, but they made sure they didn't let it pass without producing what the Cardinals offered with a couple of outs. A ground ball to the right side brought home McNeil to double the Mets' lead, and Nimmo scored on a sacrifice fly to Nootbaar in right field, bringing the Mets lead up to 3-0. One of the runs was unearned due to the error. Both could have been avoided.\n\nIt was unproductive but also quick\n\nFor the first five innings of the Mets' visit, the Cardinals lineup continued its season-long search for runs but didn't waste much time coming up empty.\n\nWith a pace of game usually reserved for the Grapefruit League, Mets lefty Manaea breezed through the Cardinals lineup with both swift and unproductive outs. On his 18th pitch of the game, Manaea got his fourth out, while Gibson needed 40 pitches to get his first six. It took Manaea 51 pitches to get the first 12 outs, and through the Cardinals' first 16 batters, they had only two hits. It was a continuation of the lack of offense they had Sunday against the White Sox or this past week in Detroit or last month at home.\n\nJust quicker.\n\nManaea got help from McNeil with a diving catch in left-center field, and he got help from the Cardinals in other spots with runners in scoring position. Innings ended on soft line drives and ground outs with runners watching from second base.\n\nThe Mets lefty trimmed his ERA beneath 3.00 for a moment in the game before allowing the three runs. He struck out only one Cardinal in his six innings, but he was able to get quick-contact outs to limit them to the six hits, three of which came in the sixth inning.\n\nFoiled by former Cardinals\n\nA week that began with Jack Flaherty's 14 strikeouts and seven consecutive to start a game against his former team continued to find new ways for old Cardinals to play key roles against their former team. Former Cardinals All-Star Paul DeJong had two doubles and scored two runs in the White Sox win Sunday at Busch. Tommy Pham had an RBI for the Sox in their extra-inning win Saturday, and it was former Cardinals reliever John Brebbia with two key outs with the bases loaded in extra innings that allowed the Sox to win that game.\n\nOn Monday, it was the Cardinals' former Gold Glove-winning center fielder Harrison Bader, a midgame replacement for the Mets, coming up with a late-game double against his club, it was a first-round pick by the Cardinals, like Flaherty, who foiled them.\n\nAdam Ottavino pitched around a single in the eighth inning to preserve the Mets' one-run lead and carry it to one of the top closers in the game. Cue the trumpets.\n\nThe dirge continues.\n\n0 Comments Tags Pro-baseball St. Louis Cardinals Derrick Goold Cardinals Kyle Gibson Sean Manaea Harrison Bader Edwin Diaz Paul Goldschmidt Willson

LOUIS (AP) -- Brandon Nimmo hit a tiebreaking homer in the seventh inning that sent the New York Mets to a 4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night.\n\n\"Honestly, the home run I hit was a good pitch,\" Nimmo said. \"That's something that really gives you confidence.\"\n\nSean Manaea (2-1) pitched six effective innings and Edwin D\u00edaz rebounded from a rare blown save Sunday as the Mets bounced back from a weekend sweep at Tampa Bay.\n\n\"He was aggressive with all of his pitches,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said about Manaea. \"He just threw strikes. That was the plan. He attacked the hitters.\"\n\nIv\u00e1n Herrera had a two-run double for the Cardinals, who have lost five of six.\n\nD\u00edaz worked a 1-2-3 inning for his fifth save in six opportunities. The star closer gave up Randy Arozarena's tying solo homer on a full-count pitch with two outs in the ninth Sunday, and the Rays went on to win 7-6 in 10 innings.\n\nBefore that, D\u00edaz had converted 26 consecutive save chances dating to 2022 -- which was the longest active streak in the majors.\n\nManaea allowed three runs, six hits and one walk in his first career start against the Cardinals. He became the first Mets starter to earn a win since Luis Severino beat Pittsburgh 9-1 on April 17.\n\n\"I was just attacking guys,\" Manaea said. \"I felt good. My fastball and cutter were really, really good. I thought my changeup was OK. My sweeper was good. All in all, it was a pretty good outing.\"\n\nNimmo went deep off Andrew Kittredge (0-1) with one out in the seventh, putting the Mets up 4-3 with his second go-ahead homer this season. New York's leadoff man finished with two hits and scored twice. He is 13 for 41 (.317) with two home runs and seven RBIs over the last 11 games.\n\n\"I felt like, hey, it's coming around,\" Nimmo said. \"I still feel like there's more in the tank that I can get better at. I got some good pitches to do something with tonight. I just try and keep my head down and battle.\"\n\nIt was the first homer allowed by Kittredge this year.\n\n\"It's tough. If it's not one thing, it's another,\" he said. \"Our goal when we toe the mound is to put up zeros. It's a long season. Right now, we're trying to hang in there.\"\n\nSt. Louis tied the score with three runs in the sixth. Willson Contreras doubled in Jos\u00e9 Ferm\u00edn, who led off with a single. Paul Goldschmidt walked and Herrera doubled home two runs with two outs, but was thrown out stretching at third.\n\nThe clutch swing gave Herrera his first RBIs since April 17 and his first extra-base hit since April 10.\n\n\"We had a good inning there and then we ran into a pretty good bullpen,\" Cardinals manger Oliver Marmol said. \"It's hard to score on that back end.\"\n\nThe Mets scored twice in the fifth for a 3-0 lead. Tom\u00e1s Nido led off with his second single and went to third on Nimmo's single and an error by right fielder Lars Nootbaar. Starling Marte drove in a run with a groundout, and Francisco Lindor added a sacrifice fly.\n\nDJ Stewart had a two-out RBI double in the first off Kyle Gibson, who allowed three runs (two earned) and seven hits in six innings. Gibson has pitched six or more innings in all seven starts this season.\n\n\"My location wasn't good,\" Gibson said. \"My changeup wasn't good. We haven't played like we want to play and we're not where we want to be.\"\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nMets: Claimed RHP Yohan Ram\u00edrez off waivers from Baltimore. Ram\u00edrez began the season with the Mets before they traded him to the Orioles for cash on April 11. RHP Max Kranick was designated for assignment.\n\nCardinals: Selected RHP Chris Roycroft from Triple-A Memphis. The 6-foot-8 Roycroft posted a 1.38 ERA in 11 games at Memphis. INF Tommy Edman (right wrist surgery) was transferred to the 60-day injured list.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: C Francisco Alvarez (left thumb surgery) had stitches removed.\n\nCardinals: Placed RHP Giovanny Gallegos (right shoulder impingement) on the 15-day injured list. Gallegos is 2-1 with a 12.00 ERA and one save in 13 appearances. ... INF/DH Matt Carpenter (right oblique strain) will head to Triple-A Memphis on Tuesday to continue his rehab assignment.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMets: RHP Jos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 (0-2, 2.57 ERA) took the loss April 26 against St. Louis when he allowed four runs over 5 2/3 innings.\n\nCardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas (2-4, 5.68) threw a season-high 101 pitches in his last start, a 4-1 defeat in Detroit.", "source":

They had won the day before, but had gone ten of fourteen before that, and another series win would both provide a salvo to some of the bad vibes and make the road trip seem like not a total disaster. Jos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 was taking the mound for the Mets, and while he was a little uneven as of late, one could reasonably hope the below-average Cardinals offense would allow him to regain some of his mojo. Miles Mikolas was starting for the Cardinals, and while his season thus far has left something to be desired, he'd always been pretty good when facing the Mets.\n\nIn the top of the first, Starling Marte got a one-out single, but otherwise the Mets went down quietly. In the bottom of the inning, Butt\u00f3 had quite a go of it. Brendan Donovan led off with a solo home run for the Cardinals, giving them the lead immediately. A Lars Nootbaar walk was followed by a Willson Contreras double that was misplayed in left field by DJ Stewart, who definitely showed his defense deficiencies. Nolan Arenado hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Nootbar, and Alec Burleson hit a two-out single to drive in Contreras. Butt\u00f3 cut the bleeding by getting Nolan Gorman to fly out and leaving the lead at three runs.\n\nThe top of the second inning was similarly action-packed, but terribly so. With one out, J.D. Martinez swung at a Mikolas pitch that Contreras was reaching for and Martinez swung his bat right into Contreras' forearm. Contreras was writhing around in pain and after a few minutes he came out of the game, to be replaced by Iv\u00e1n Herrera. Later in the evening it was revealed that Contreras had a left arm fracture, so he will be out for a decent stretch of time, a crushing blow to the Cardinals for the immediate future. A two-out single by Jeff McNeil put two runners on but nothing ended up coming of it. In the bottom of the inning, Butt\u00f3 gave up a walk and a single to put himself in immediate trouble with no outs, but a strikeout and two force outs ended the inning before the Cardinals could score again.\n\nThe next couple of innings were quiet. With the exception of a two-out single from Lindor, the Mets did nothing in the top of the third. In the bottom of the third, Arenado got a single but a fly out from Paul Goldschmidt and a double play courtesy of Alec Burleson shut down any sort of trouble that could stem from that. In the top of the fourth, the Mets went down in order, and the Cardinals did the same in the bottom of the inning, which also included a beautiful diving catch by Brandon Nimmo.\n\nThe Mets went unexpectedly bonkers in the top of the fifth. McNeil led off with a lucky single to Arenado, a ball Arenado has turned into an out countless times in his career but didn't this time, and a ball that turned into a rolling snowball of runs for the Mets. Nido followed with a well-struck single, and Nimmo struck a monster three-run home run to center field to tie the game. Marte doubled,a dn a Lindor single moved him to third. Pete Alonso then hit a much-needed (for him, especially) double to drive in Marte and Lindor and put the Mets up by two runs. This drove Mikolas from the game, with the Cardinals calling on Kyle Leahy to try and stop the Mets torrent of offense. DJ Stewart grounded out for the first out, and moved Alonso to third, which allowed him to score on the Martinez single that followed. That was it for the scoring for the Mets this inning, but a double play ball that turned into a force out for Baty allowed the Mets to bat around in the inning, and McNeil to get his second hit of the inning before all was said and done.\n\nIn the bottom of the fifth, the Mets made some changes to help shore up the defense and try to hold onto their three run lead. Nimmo moved from center field to left field, and Harrison Bader came in to play center field, knocking Stewart out of the game. With the exception of a Lars Nootbaar walk, the Cardinals went down without much of a fight. A leadoff walk for Nimmo in the top of the sixth didn't lead anywhere, and the Mets went down quietly after their offensive explosion. The Mets brough Cole Sulser in to relieve Butt\u00f3, and while he did give up a one-out, solo home run to Burleson, he did keep the scoring to that single run, leaving the inning with a two-run lead.\n\nRyan Fernandez came in for the Cardinals in the top of the seventh, and other than a Brett Baty two-out single, he kept the Mets from doing any more damage. Sean Reid-Foley came in for the bottom of the seventh, and after getting pinch-hitter Jos\u00e9 Ferm\u00edn to ground out, a Donovan single and Nootbar walk drove Reid-Foley from the game after his requisite three batters. In came Jorge L\u00f3pez, and a Herrera single loaded the bases with only one out and threatened the Mets lead. But Arenado hit a pop up that induced the infield fly rule, and Goldschmidt struck out to keep the Cardinals off the board in maybe the best chance they had to score since the first inning.\n\nFernandez stayed in for the Cardinals in the eighth, and Dylan Carlson came in to play center field after Ferm\u00edn pinch-hit for Michael Siani. The Mets went down in order in the top of the inning, with three ground outs in a row. In the bottom of the inning Reed Garrett came in for the Mets. Burleson led off with a single, then Gorman struck out. A Brandon Crawford force out left a runner still on first but with two outs, and Reed Garrett struck Carlson out looking to get the Mets through the eighth. Only three outs stood between the Mets and a series win.\n\nThe Cardinals brought in Chris Roycroft to make his major league debut and keep the game at only two runs for the Cardinals to attempt a ninth inning comeback. He struck out Lindor, but Alonso hit a solo home run to stretch the lead to three runs again. That was it for the scoring for the Mets in the top of the ninth, and they turned to Adam Ottavino to close the game out. Donovan grounded out for the first out, then Nootbaar hit a solo home run (this game's specialty, it seems like) to cut the lead to two. Herrera hit a single to bring up Arenado with a runner on and one out. Arenado walked to bring up Goldschmidt as the winning run. Goldschmidt struck out and the Cardinals fate was left in Alec Burleson's bat. But Burleson struck out swinging to end the game, and the Mets won the series against the Cardinals.\n\nThe Mets won the series after being swept in disheartening fashion against the Rays. Pete Alonso looked to be starting to break out of his horrific slump, and Nimmo continued to be hot. Butt\u00f3, despite early woes, stuck around in the game to keep the Cardinals scoreless after the first, an effort that will likely go unpraised despite it being a big part of the win. The bullpen once again was stellar, keeping the Cardinals from scoring more when they had the baserunners to do so. There are some usage concerns with the bullpen at this point, and the team still has some pretty glaring flaws, but for the moment, a win is a win.", "source": {"uri": "amazinavenue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amazin' Avenue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_carbone@amazinavenue.com", "name": "Grace Carbone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Mikolas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miles Mikolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starling Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

LOUIS -- Most of Brandon Nimmo's first month was about as dreary as the New York weather, but May flowers have arrived.\n\nThe Mets were in need of a jolt offensively after flushing a three-run lead Monday night, and Nimmo was there to deliver a haymaker that disappeared into a sea of red.\n\nNimmo's seventh-inning home run was the difference for the Mets in their 4-3 victory over the Cardinals at Busch Stadium.\n\nThe Mets snapped a three-game losing streak, playing in a ninth straight contest that was decided by two runs or fewer.\n\nNimmo, who entered with a .919 OPS over his previous 10 games after slumping for much of April, handled the heavy lifting on a night Pete Alonso was on the bench amid a 1-for-28 slump that was extended after he entered this game as a defensive replacement.\n\nAfter two straight letdowns from their bullpen, the Mets (17-18) received three innings of scoreless relief from Jake Diekman, Adam Ottavino and Edwin Diaz.\n\nIn pitching a perfect ninth, Diaz rebounded from his first blown save of the season a day earlier, when he allowed a game-tying homer at Tampa Bay.\n\nSean Manaea lasted six innings for his longest start since his Mets debut and allowed three earned runs on six hits with one walk and one strikeout over 89 pitches.\n\nIt marked only the second time this season the lefty allowed more than two earned runs in a start.\n\nDJ Stewart's RBI double in the first inning gave the Mets a 1-0 lead. Francisco Lindor drew a two-out walk against Kyle Gibson before Stewart -- starting at first base with Alonso on the bench -- delivered for his 16th RBI this season.\n\nManaea received defensive help with Jeff McNeil's diving catch in left field in the second inning.\n\nThe play looked even better after Brendan Donovan's ensuing double, but Masyn Winn was retired to end the inning.\n\nThe Mets scored twice in the fifth inning on outs to extend their lead to 3-0.\n\nAfter Lars Nootbaar misplayed Nimmo's single to put runners on second and third with nobody out, Starling Marte's ground out brought in the inning's first run.\n\nLindor followed with a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe rally started with Tomas Nido's second hit of the game, a leadoff single.\n\nManaea retired nine straight batters before Winn smacked a two-out double in the fifth.\n\nBut Manaea rebounded to retire Nootbaar and preserve the Mets' three-run lead.\n\nThe Cardinals jumped on Manaea in the sixth. Willson Contreras stroked an RBI double and Paul Goldschmidt walked to continue the rally.\n\nManaea recorded two straight outs before Ivan Herrera delivered a two-run double that tied it 3-3.\n\nNimmo homered in the seventh to reclaim the lead for the Mets at 4-3.\n\nNimmo crushed a high breaking ball from Andrew Kittredge, who had allowed only one earned run over his previous 14

LOUIS -- Brandon Nimmo hit a tiebreaking homer in the seventh inning that sent the New York Mets to a 4-3 victory Monday night against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\"Honestly, the home run I hit was a good pitch,\" Nimmo said. \"That's something that really gives you confidence.\"\n\nSean Manaea (2-1) pitched six effective innings and Edwin D\u00edaz rebounded from a rare blown save Sunday as the Mets bounced back from a weekend sweep at Tampa Bay.\n\n\"He was aggressive with all of his pitches,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said about Manaea. \"He just threw strikes. That was the plan. He attacked the hitters.\"\n\nIv\u00e1n Herrera had a two-run double for the Cardinals, who have lost five of six.\n\nD\u00edaz worked a 1-2-3 inning for his fifth save in six opportunities. The star closer gave up Randy Arozarena's tying solo homer on a full-count pitch with two outs in the ninth Sunday, and the Rays went on to win 7-6 in 10 innings.\n\nBefore that, D\u00edaz had converted 26 consecutive save chances dating to 2022 -- which was the longest active streak in the majors.\n\nManaea allowed three runs, six hits and one walk in his first start against the Cardinals. He became the first Mets starter to earn a win since Luis Severino beat Pittsburgh 9-1 on April 17.\n\nNimmo went deep off Andrew Kittredge (0-1) with one out in the seventh, putting the Mets up 4-3 with his second go-ahead homer this season. New York's leadoff man finished with two hits and scored twice. He is 13-for-41 (.317) with two home runs and seven RBI in the past 11 games.\n\n\"I felt like, hey, it's coming around,\" Nimmo said. \"I still feel like there's more in the tank that I can get better at. I got some good pitches to do something with tonight. I just try and keep my head down and battle.\"\n\nIt was the first homer allowed by Kittredge this year.\n\n\"It's tough. If it's not one thing, it's another,\" he said. \"Our goal when we toe the mound is to put up zeros. It's a long season. Right now, we're trying to hang in there.\"\n\nSt. Louis tied the score with three runs in the sixth. Willson Contreras doubled in Jos\u00e9 Ferm\u00edn, who led off with a single. Paul Goldschmidt walked and Herrera doubled home two runs with two outs, but was thrown out stretching at third.\n\n\"We had a good inning there and then we ran into a pretty good bullpen,\" Cardinals manger Oliver Marmol said. \"It's hard to score on that back end.\"\n\nNotes: Mets RHP Jos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 (0-2, 2.57 ERA) took the loss April 26 against St. Louis when he allowed four runs in 5\u2154 innings. Cardinals RHP Miles Mikolas (2-4, 5.68) threw a season-high 101 pitches in his last start, a 4-1 defeat in Detroit.", "source": {"uri": "fultonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fulton Sun, The"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kittredge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Kittredge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Herrera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelvin Herrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Mikolas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miles Mikolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2024/05/07/cardinals_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544734", "eventUri": "eng-9544734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1234, "textEnd": 1242}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2432, "textEnd": 2440}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It was his fourth round-tripper of the season and second time he's gone deep in his last eight contests since April 29.

LOUIS (AP) -- Brandon Nimmo hit a three-run homer to spark a six-run fifth inning, and the New York Mets rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-5 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Cardinals not only dropped their fourth straight game, but also lost catcher Willson Contreras to a broken left forearm in the second inning after he was hit by J.D. Martinez's swing. Contreras, a three-time All-Star, is hitting .280 with a team-leading six home runs and 12 RBIs.\n\nJos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 allowed three runs in five innings as the Mets won their second consecutive game. All three runs he permitted came in the first, but Butt\u00f3 (1-2) retired nine of his last 10 batters. He yielded five hits, struck out three and walked three.\n\nCole Sulser gave up a solo homer to Alec Burleson in the sixth, Jorge L\u00f3pez pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh and Reed Garrett worked a scoreless eighth for New York. Adam Ottavino allowed a solo homer to Lars Nootbaar, but earned his first save of the season.\n\nNimmo's three-run homer off Miles Mikolas, a 440-foot drive to straightaway center field, tied it 3-all in the fifth. Nimmo, who hit a go-ahead homer Monday, also made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Nolan Gorman of a hit in the fourth.\n\nNimmo's dinger was the third of six straight hits to start the inning as the Mets sent 11 batters to the plate in the fifth. Pete Alonso ended slumps of 1 for 32 and 2 for 39 with a two-run double and scored on Martinez's single to give New York a 6-3 lead.\n\nAlonso added a solo homer off Chris Roycroft, who was making his major league debut, in the ninth.\n\nBrendan Donovan drove Butt\u00f3's fourth pitch 407 feet over the right-center wall. It was Donovan's second career leadoff homer.\n\nThe Cardinals plated two more in the first inning on Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Burleson to take a 3-0 lead.\n\nMikolas (2-5) allowed six runs and nine hits in four-plus innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: RHP Tylor Megill (right shoulder strain) pitched four scoreless innings, striking out seven and walking just one on 62 pitches during a rehab start at Triple-A Syracuse. ... RHP Kodai Senga (right shoulder capsule strain) is expected to throw a bullpen Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nCardinals: INF/DH Matt Carpenter (right oblique strain) had a pair of hits, including a two-run homer, in his first rehab game at Triple-A Memphis.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Cardinals will send out RHP Sonny Gray (4-1, 0.89 ERA) against LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA) and the Mets in the finale of the three-game series on Wednesday. Gray's ERA is the lowest by a Cardinals pitcher in his first five starts with the team since 1910.

Will former Cardinal Jose Quintana lead New York to an upset win today at Busch Stadium? Or is there a better play in the finale of the Mets vs. Cardinals series?\n\nMets vs. Cardinals: Public Bettors Leaning Towards New York\n\nAs of this writing, our MLB Public Betting Page shows that 66% of bets are on the Cardinals' moneyline. That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nAlonso hits homer, double in win\n\nPete Alonso went 2-for-5 with a homer, double, and three RBI in the Mets' win over the Cardinals on Tuesday night. Alonso broke out in a big way against Miles Mikolas and the Cardinals after a 2-for-44 lull. His two-run double gave the Mets the lead and his eighth inning homer added a valuable insurance run as Adam Ottavino ran into trouble in the ninth. All three of the balls Alonso put in play were hit over 105 MPH exit velocity.\n\nContreras to miss 6-8 weeks with fractured forearm\n\nWillson Contreras will miss 6-8 weeks after undergoing surgery later this week on his fractured left forearm. It's a significant development for the Cardinals as Contreras will wind up requiring surgery to repair a fractured left forearm that he suffered during Tuesday's game against the Mets when he was struck by a swing from J.D. Martinez. The 31-year-old backstop should be ready to return sometime around the All-Star break, barring any setbacks. It'll be Iv\u00e1n Herrera and Pedro Pag\u00e9s handling the catching duties in his absence.\n\nMets vs. Cardinals MLB Betting Trends\n\nThe total has gone OVER in 10 of NY Mets' last 14 games on the road\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 10 of St. Louis' last 14 games at home\n\nOver/Under has gone UNDER in 5 of NY Mets' last 7 games against an opponent in the National League\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 12 of St. Louis' last 17 games against an opponent in the National League\n\nMets vs. Cardinals MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake New York.

LOUIS -- Pete Alonso sure resembled Pete Alonso on Tuesday, with two big swings that might have signaled he's back.\n\nAfter Brandon Nimmo's mammoth home run tied the game in the fifth inning and hits from Starling Marte and Francisco Lindor followed, Alonso launched a shot to right-center and was soon standing on second base thumping his chest and gesturing toward his Mets teammates in the third-base dugout.\n\nAlonso's double had knocked in the go-ahead runs.\n\nFor good measure he smashed a ninth-inning homer for insurance, helping the Mets to a 7-5 victory over the Cardinals at Busch Stadium.\n\nAlonso, who entered in a 1-for-30 skid, snapped a hitless streak of 17 at-bats with his double.\n\nThe Mets scored all but one of their runs in that frantic fifth inning in which they sent 11 batters to the plate.\n\nAlonso's homer was his ninth of the season and first since he slugged No. 200 in his career on April 27 against the Cardinals.\n\nThe Mets can complete a three-game sweep that would even the road trip when they face the Cardinals in Wednesday's series finale.\n\nThe Mets (18-18) survived the late innings, as Cole Sulser, Sean Reid-Foley, Jorge Lopez, Reed Garrett and Adam Ottavino combined to allow two runs over four frames behind Jose Butto.\n\nOttavino allowed a homer to Lars Nootbaar in the ninth and put the tying runs on base before striking out Paul Goldschmidt and Alec Burleson to end it.\n\nLopez escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh by retiring Nolan Arenado before striking out Goldschmidt to preserve the Mets' two-run lead.\n\nButto survived a rocky first inning to get the Mets through the fifth.\n\nOverall he allowed three earned runs on five hits with three walks and three strikeouts.\n\nThe right-hander was coming off an appearance against the Cubs in which he allowed one earned run over six innings.\n\nButto got pounced on in the first inning, when the Cardinals sent seven batters to the plate and scored three runs. But he allowed only three base runners over the next four innings.\n\nBrendan Donovan homered leading off the game for the Cardinals before Nootbaar walked and Willson Contreras hit a drive to left field that deflected off DJ Stewart's glove for a double.\n\nArenado's sacrifice fly brought in a run before Burleson delivered an RBI single that placed the Mets in a 3-0 hole.\n\nContreras left the game in the second inning after crumpling to the ground in agony as J.D. Martinez's swing struck his left arm.\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on catcher's interference and Contreras was diagnosed with a fractured left arm.\n\nButto walked Brandon Crawford to begin the second and allowed a single to Michael Siani before getting three straight outs to escape.\n\nCrawford's diving stop on Alonso's grounder and flip to second ended the top of the third inning after Lindor had delivered a two-run single.\n\nNimmo unleashed a 440-foot rocket to center field in the fifth for a three-run homer against Miles Mikolas that tied it 3-3.\n\nThe blast came a night after Nimmo's seventh-inning homer delivered the Mets' decisive run.\n\nJeff McNeil hit a bloop single leading off the fifth on this night before Tomas Nido's shot off Arenado's glove went for a single.\n\nNimmo followed with his fifth homer of the season.\n\nA new rally in the inning began with Marte's double off the left-field fence before Lindor singled.\n\nAlonso followed with a two-run double that gave the Mets a 5-3 lead. Martinez's RBI single -- the Mets' seventh hit of the inning -- brought in Alonso.\n\nThe six runs for the Mets were their most in any inning this season.\n\nMcNeil's third hit of the game extended the inning before Nido, the 11th batter in the inning, was retired for the final out.\n\nSulser surrendered a homer to Burleson in the sixth that brought the Cardinals within 6-4.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starling Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Nootbaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lars Nootbaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Sulser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Sulser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interference (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Mikolas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miles Mikolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez's bat swing while the Cardinals were enduring their fourth consecutive loss and sixth defeat in seven games.\n\n\"It's a tough one,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"(Contreras) was doing such a phenomenal job. He's a great competitor, he brings so much to the club, performance-wise but also his competitive nature. To see him go down was definitely tough.\"\n\nIvan Herrera, St. Louis' backup catcher, went 2-for-4 after replacing Contreras in the second inning. Catcher Pedro Pages, who was sent to the minors on Sunday, likely will return to fill Contreras' roster spot.\n\nIn the other dugout, New York's Brandon Nimmo went 3-for-9 with two homers, three runs and four RBIs as the Mets won the first two games of the series.\n\n\"I have felt like it's coming around,\" Nimmo said. \"I still feel like there's more in the tank I can get better at, but I also believe we have just stayed the course and been trying to make small adjustments along the way and not change too much.\"\n\nPete Alonso, who was 1-for-29 in his previous nine games, hit a two-run double and a solo homer on Tuesday.\n\nThe Mets will give the ball Wednesday to left-hander Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA), who will look to rebound from his worst outing of the season. He allowed eight runs on 10 hits in 2 2/3 innings against the Tampa Bay Rays as the Mets lost 10-8 on Friday.\n\n\"I felt great,\" Quintana said after the game. \"I just need to get more sharp. I'm going to keep competing. I just have to turn the page and get focused. When you get that support, it's very frustrating to not take advantage of that.\"\n\nPrior to that outing, Quintana allowed two runs or fewer in four of six starts. He held the Cardinals to one run on three hits over eight innings on April 28 in a game the Mets eventually won 4-2 in 11 innings.\n\n\"He has been giving us five, six innings,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said after Quintana's loss to the Rays. \"He has always kept us in the game. Today, it got out of hand and he didn't have it. But overall, he has been that guy who's going to keep us in games. Today, it wasn't the case.\"\n\nQuintana is 6-4 with a 3.95 ERA in 14 career starts against the Cardinals.\n\nThe Cardinals will turn to right-hander Sonny Gray (4-1, 0.89 ERA) while trying to pause their free fall.\n\nGray threw seven scoreless innings in his latest start, a 3-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Friday. He allowed three hits while striking out six batters and walking one.\n\n\"He's a real one,\" Marmol said. \"I can't say enough about the way he prepares and his ability to execute. He just does a phenomenal job. ... He knows what he's good at, but he also knows what the opposition is not good at and he attacks it extremely well.\"\n\nGray earned a 7-4 victory over the Mets on April 27. He allowed four runs, one earned, on four hits, including a two-run homer by Alonso, in six innings. He struck out nine and walked three.\n\nIn his career, Gray is 4-0 with a 2.31 ERA in four starts against the Mets.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Herrera", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelvin Herrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

LOUIS (AP) -- Brandon Nimmo hit a three-run homer to spark a six-run fifth inning, and the New York Mets rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-5 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Cardinals not only dropped their fourth straight game, but also lost catcher Willson Contreras to a broken left forearm in the second inning after he was hit by J.D. Martinez's swing. Contreras, a three-time All-Star, is hitting .280 with a team-leading six home runs and 12 RBIs.\n\n\"I'm in pain pretty good, but I'm really upset missing,\" Contreras said. \"I know that it's going to be tough for me to watch the games and not out there with the guys, but I'm going to do my best to stay present, pick each other up and cheer for them because that's the best thing I can do.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 allowed three runs in five innings as the Mets won their second consecutive game. All three runs he permitted came in the first, but Butt\u00f3 (1-2) retired nine of his last 10 batters. He yielded five hits, struck out three and walked three.\n\n\"It was a struggle for him, especially with the fastball command, that two-seamer,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"He couldn't find it. But he kept making pitches. I thought the secondaries kind of kept him in the game -- the changeup, the breaking ball.\"\n\nCole Sulser gave up a solo homer to Alec Burleson in the sixth, Jorge L\u00f3pez pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh and Reed Garrett worked a scoreless eighth for New York. Adam Ottavino allowed a solo homer to Lars Nootbaar, but earned his first save of the season.\n\nNimmo's three-run homer off Miles Mikolas, a 440-foot drive to straightaway center field, tied it 3-all in the fifth. Nimmo, who hit a go-ahead homer Monday, also made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Nolan Gorman of a hit in the fourth.\n\n\"He's continued to put together good at-bats, controlling the strike zone and doing damage with the pitches he can do damage with,\" Mendoza said.\n\nNimmo's dinger was the third of six straight hits to start the inning as the Mets sent 11 batters to the plate in the fifth. Pete Alonso ended slumps of 1 for 32 and 2 for 39 with a two-run double and scored on Martinez's single to give New York a 6-3 lead.\n\nAlonso added a solo homer off Chris Roycroft, who was making his major league debut, in the ninth.\n\n\"It's really nice to be able to help in the manner that I did tonight, and I just want to continue to have good, quality at-bats and keep hitting the ball hard,\" Alonso said.\n\nBrendan Donovan drove Butt\u00f3's fourth pitch 407 feet over the right-center wall. It was Donovan's second career leadoff homer.\n\nThe Cardinals plated two more in the first inning on Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Burleson to take a 3-0 lead.\n\nMikolas (2-5) allowed six runs and nine hits in four-plus innings, but after the game the focus was on Contreras.\n\n\"It's a tough one, man,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"He's been doing such a phenomenal job. He's an extreme competitor. He brings so much to the club performance-wise, but also with just his competitive nature, so to see him go down is tough. I feel for him, I really do. He was putting together a really nice year and helping us in a lot of ways, so it's a tough one.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: RHP Tylor Megill (right shoulder strain) pitched four scoreless innings in a rehab start at Triple-A Syracuse, striking out seven and walking one on 62 pitches. ... RHP Kodai Senga (right shoulder capsule strain) is expected to throw a bullpen Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nCardinals: INF/DH Matt Carpenter (right oblique strain) had a pair of hits, including a two-run homer, in his first rehab game at Triple-A Memphis.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSt. Louis RHP Sonny Gray (4-1, 0.89 ERA) opposes LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20) in the finale of the three-game series Wednesday. Gray's ERA is the lowest for a Cardinals pitcher in his first five starts with the team since 1910. Quintana threw a season-high eight innings against St. Louis on April 28.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

It's the third straight game the Mets have scored in the first inning.\n\n- Sean Manaea started the game strong, allowing a leadoff single before settling in to get three straight outs. The left-hander allowed a two-out double in the second, but escaped the inning without any damage thanks to a diving catch from Jeff McNeil that'll be seen later on SportsCenter's Top 10 Plays.\n\nManaea kept it going with back-to-back 1-2-3 innings in the third and fourth. The lefty retired two more Cardinals in the fifth inning to give him nine straight outs, but Masyn Winn hit ground-rule double to snap the streak. He started to cool down on the mound in the sixth, allowing a leadoff single and an RBI double to Willson Contreras to make it a 3-1 game. After two straight outs, Ivan Herrera doubled off Manaea to tie the game at 3-3, but was thrown out at third to end the side.\n\nManaea's night ended after six innings, allowing the three runs on six hits with just one strikeout and one walk over 89 pitches. His season ERA now sits at a 3.31. He's the first Mets starter to earn a win since April 17.\n\n- The New York bats woke up in the fifth inning. Tomas Nido recorded his second hit of the night and advanced to third base on Brandon Nimmo's line drive that was misplayed by the right fielder Lars Nootbaar, allowing him to go to second. Starling Marte drove in Nido on a groundout and Francisco Lindor hit a sacrifice fly to score Nimmo as the Mets took a 3-0 lead.\n\n- Nimmo crushed a hanging slider to give the Mets a 4-3 lead in the top of the seventh inning. It's Nimmo's fourth home run of the year and just the first allowed by Cardinals reliever Andrew Kittredge.\n\n- Pete Alonso came into the game for Joey Wendle in the sixth inning with Stewart moving to left field and McNeil moving to second base. It was Alonso's first, non-start after 126 consecutive starts. He lined out to second base in his lone at-bat of the night in the eighth inning.\n\n- McNeil, who had been 1 for his last 21, slapped a single to center in the top of the ninth.\n\n- Adam Ottavino came in for relief in the eighth and kept the score intact, allowing one single and striking out one. Edwin Diaz bounced back after blowing a save against Tampa Bay. The righty used his fastball early and often to strike out Alec Burleson. Diaz then got a groundout to Alonso at first and another to McNeil at second to seal the victory.\n\nNimmo finished the game 2-for-5 and his home run proved to be the deciding factor in the game. The outfielder has been swinging a hot bat as of late, going 8-for-25 (.320 average) with a .560 SLG and four RBI over his last seven games.\n\nThe Mets and Cardinals continue their three-game series Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. on SNY.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Nootbaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lars Nootbaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_rule_double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ground rule double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starling Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kittredge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Kittredge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Wendle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Wendle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/sny_articles_235/fb2353de0e9a41e6f0b5f84171ab6cb7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544734", "eventUri": "eng-9544734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1330, "textEnd": 1338}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

LOUIS (AP) -- Brandon Nimmo hit a three-run homer to spark a six-run fifth inning, and the New York Mets rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-5 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Cardinals not only dropped their fourth straight game, but also lost catcher Willson Contreras to a broken left forearm in the second inning after he was hit by J.D. Martinez's swing. Contreras, a three-time All-Star, is hitting .280 with a team-leading six home runs and 12 RBIs.\n\n\"I'm in pain pretty good, but I'm really upset missing,\" Contreras said. \"I know that it's going to be tough for me to watch the games and not out there with the guys, but I'm going to do my best to stay present, pick each other up and cheer for them because that's the best thing I can do.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 allowed three runs in five innings as the Mets won their second consecutive game. All three runs he permitted came in the first, but Butt\u00f3 (1-2) retired nine of his last 10 batters. He yielded five hits, struck out three and walked three.\n\n\"It was a struggle for him, especially with the fastball command, that two-seamer,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"He couldn't find it. But he kept making pitches. I thought the secondaries kind of kept him in the game -- the changeup, the breaking ball.\"\n\nCole Sulser gave up a solo homer to Alec Burleson in the sixth, Jorge L\u00f3pez pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh and Reed Garrett worked a scoreless eighth for New York. Adam Ottavino allowed a solo homer to Lars Nootbaar, but earned his first save of the season.\n\nNimmo's three-run homer off Miles Mikolas, a 440-foot drive to straightaway center field, tied it 3-all in the fifth. Nimmo, who hit a go-ahead homer Monday, also made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Nolan Gorman of a hit in the fourth.\n\n\"He's continued to put together good at-bats, controlling the strike zone and doing damage with the pitches he can do damage with,\" Mendoza said.\n\nNimmo's dinger was the third of six straight hits to start the inning as the Mets sent 11 batters to the plate in the fifth. Pete Alonso ended slumps of 1 for 32 and 2 for 39 with a two-run double and scored on Martinez's single to give New York a 6-3 lead.\n\nAlonso added a solo homer off Chris Roycroft, who was making his major league debut, in the ninth.\n\n\"It's really nice to be able to help in the manner that I did tonight, and I just want to continue to have good, quality at-bats and keep hitting the ball hard,\" Alonso said.\n\nBrendan Donovan drove Butt\u00f3's fourth pitch 407 feet over the right-center wall. It was Donovan's second career leadoff homer.\n\nThe Cardinals plated two more in the first inning on Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Burleson to take a 3-0 lead.\n\nMikolas (2-5) allowed six runs and nine hits in four-plus innings, but after the game the focus was on Contreras.\n\n\"It's a tough one, man,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"He's been doing such a phenomenal job. He's an extreme competitor. He brings so much to the club performance-wise, but also with just his competitive nature, so to see him go down is tough. I feel for him, I really do. He was putting together a really nice year and helping us in a lot of ways, so it's a tough one.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: RHP Tylor Megill (right shoulder strain) pitched four scoreless innings in a rehab start at Triple-A Syracuse, striking out seven and walking one on 62 pitches. ... RHP Kodai Senga (right shoulder capsule strain) is expected to throw a bullpen Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nCardinals: INF/DH Matt Carpenter (right oblique strain) had a pair of hits, including a two-run homer, in his first rehab game at Triple-A Memphis.\n\nSt. Louis RHP Sonny Gray (4-1, 0.89 ERA) opposes LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20) in the finale of the three-game series Wednesday. Gray's ERA is the lowest for a Cardinals pitcher in his first five starts with the team since 1910.

Martinez's bat swing while the Cardinals were enduring their fourth consecutive loss and sixth defeat in seven games.\n\n\"It's a tough one,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"(Contreras) was doing such a phenomenal job. He's a great competitor, he brings so much to the club, performance-wise but also his competitive nature. To see him go down was definitely tough.\"\n\nIvan Herrera, St. Louis' backup catcher, went 2-for-4 after replacing Contreras in the second inning. Catcher Pedro Pages, who was sent to the minors on Sunday, likely will return to fill Contreras' roster spot.\n\nIn the other dugout, New York's Brandon Nimmo went 3-for-9 with two homers, three runs and four RBIs as the Mets won the first two games of the series.\n\n\"I have felt like it's coming around,\" Nimmo said. \"I still feel like there's more in the tank I can get better at, but I also believe we have just stayed the course and been trying to make small adjustments along the way and not change too much.\"\n\nPete Alonso, who was 1-for-29 in his previous nine games, hit a two-run double and a solo homer on Tuesday.\n\nThe Mets will give the ball Wednesday to left-hander Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA), who will look to rebound from his worst outing of the season. He allowed eight runs on 10 hits in 2 2/3 innings against the Tampa Bay Rays as the Mets lost 10-8 on Friday.\n\n\"I felt great,\" Quintana said after the game. \"I just need to get more sharp. I'm going to keep competing. I just have to turn the page and get focused. When you get that support, it's very frustrating to not take advantage of that.\"\n\nPrior to that outing, Quintana allowed two runs or fewer in four of six starts. He held the Cardinals to one run on three hits over eight innings on April 28 in a game the Mets eventually won 4-2 in 11 innings.\n\n\"He has been giving us five, six innings,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said after Quintana's loss to the Rays. \"He has always kept us in the game. Today, it got out of hand and he didn't have it. But overall, he has been that guy who's going to keep us in games. Today, it wasn't the case.\"\n\nQuintana is 6-4 with a 3.95 ERA in 14 career starts against the Cardinals.\n\nThe Cardinals will turn to right-hander Sonny Gray (4-1, 0.89 ERA) while trying to pause their free fall.\n\nGray threw seven scoreless innings in his latest start, a 3-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Friday. He allowed three hits while striking out six batters and walking one.\n\n\"He's a real one,\" Marmol said. \"I can't say enough about the way he prepares and his ability to execute. He just does a phenomenal job. ... He knows what he's good at, but he also knows what the opposition is not good at and he attacks it extremely well.\"\n\nGray earned a 7-4 victory over the Mets on April 27. He allowed four runs, one earned, on four hits, including a two-run homer by Alonso, in six innings.

Francisco Lindor worked a two out walk against starter Kyle Gibson, and clean up hitting first baseman DJ Stewart -- who got his first career Major League start at first after seeing 16 games there in Syracuse last season -- doubled him home. The Mets would add two more in the fifth in the most old-school way possible. A lead off single by Tomas Nido started the rally, and a single by Brandon Nimmo kept the line moving. Lars Nootbar made a mess of it in right, though, and an error turned a first and second with no outs situation into a second and third with no outs situation.\n\nThe Mets capitalized in a way that would make everyone's Little League coach proud. Starling Marte grounded out to second to make it 2-0, and Francisco Lindor hit a sacrifice fly to make it 3-0.\n\nSean Manaea was good, for the most part. He only struck out one, but he also only walked one. He kept a (admittedly struggling) Cardinals lineup mostly at bay, scattering just six hits over six, and only allowing two runners in scoring position in the first five innings. The sixth was much less kind to him, however. A lead off single to Jos\u00e9 Ferm\u00edn, and a subsequent double by Willson Contreras, cut the lead to 3-1. Paul Goldschmidt worked a walk, and Manaea got the next two batters to make it seem like he would bend but not break on the evening. He could not get out of the inning further unscathed, as Iv\u00e1n Herrera smoked a ball into center field for a double to tie the game at three. He attempted to stretch it into a triple but was thrown out, bailing out the Mets a wee bit.\n\nBrandon Nimmo quickly decided that he wanted Sean Manaea to get a win, absolutely unloading on a hanger thrown by Andrew Kittredge, who has been dominant so far this year. The lead off home run went 111.1 mph, and gave the Mets a 4-3 lead they would not relinquish.\n\nThe bullpen was largely excellent. Jake Diekman and Adam Ottavino pitched the seventh and eighth respectively and had identical lines. They both surrendered a hit, struck out one each, and got a hold for their efforts. Edwin D\u00edaz got the ball in the ninth and handled it with aplomb, throwing 98 mph -- a great sign considering he pitched yesterday -- and looked like his typically sharp self, getting a strike out and two ground outs to put the Mets back into the win column.", "source": {"uri": "amazinavenue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amazin' Avenue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_henderson@amazinavenue.com", "name": "Thomas Henderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starling Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Little League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kittredge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Kittredge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Diekman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Diekman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Herrera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelvin Herrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P417xHOg9CUtP1ro1IRC7sVuT4k=/0x719:6246x3842/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25436582/usa_today_23207849.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544734", "eventUri": "eng-9544734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The Mets won the first game of the series 4-3, led by a six-inning outing by Sean Manaea. The Mets needed a win in the series-opening game, as they had lost three of their last nine games before that, including a three-game sweep in Tampa Bay. The Cardinals are also in a mini-slump, losing four of their past ten games. It's the second series between these teams this season, as the Cardinals went into Queens and took two of three from the Mets. It is time to continue our MLB odds series with a Mets-Cardinals prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nJose Quintana will get the start for the Mets, and it's been an up-and-down season for him. The left-hander had his worst outing of the season against the Rays last time, going just 2 2/3 innings, allowing ten hits and eight earned runs. The start rose his ERA to 5.20 and is 8.04 over his previous three games. His ERA is even more surprising given his start against these same Cardinals last week, going eight innings, allowing three hits and one earned run. Which Jose Quintana will show up for the Mets on Wednesday?\n\nSonny Gray has been much more consistent for the Cardinals, pitching through six innings in each of his last four starts. Gray only appeared in five games this season after suffering a hamstring injury in spring training but has been hot out of the gate, allowing just three earned runs. He is 4-1 with a 0.89 ERA. Once Gray exits the game, his bullpen is also successful, owning a 2.89 ERA.\n\nThe Mets offense has been re-emerging after a poor stretch of games. They have a .231 average and five runs/nine over their past five games. These numbers aren't the greatest and won't beat most good offensive teams. However, the Cardinals have been even worse, batting .184 and averaging just 2.6 runs/nine. Sonny Gray has been the Cardinals' best pitcher this season, but even he will need more run support than 2.6 runs/nine.\n\nWhy The Cardinals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nIf Sonny Gray continues pitching like he has been to start the season, the Cardinals will have a chance to win in every one of his starts. Gray has three scoreless outings in his first five starts and hasn't allowed more than five hits in any game. The Cardinals will take the rubber match if they can jumpstart their offense against a shaken Quintana from his last start\n\nFinal Mets-Cardinals Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Cardinals have been one of the worst offensive teams in baseball, and that's even more clear over the last ten games with their marks of .184 and 2.6 runs/nine. You could look at those numbers and say it can't get much worse, but their stats against lefties over the last ten are putrid, batting .162 and averaging 1.9 runs/nine. Jose Quintana could have a field day against the Cardinals.\n\nSonny Gray is due some regression, but his form since the start of the season will at least keep his team in it. His bullpen is also above average, so it will be challenging for the Mets to generate offense all day. The Mets bullpen has been equally good, making this a great pitching battle up and down the roster.\n\nThere won't be a lot of runs in this game, but the Mets offense should be able to outlast the Cardinals and generate more. The Under and Mets moneyline are both in play.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mets-vs.-Cardinals-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544734", "eventUri": "eng-9544734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

LOUIS -- One of the Mets' key offensive catalysts is beginning to warm up.\n\nLeadoff hitter Brandon Nimmo walloped a tiebreaking home run in the seventh inning of the Mets' 4-3 win over the Cardinals on Monday night, the latest sign that he is coming around after a relatively quiet start to the season.\n\nNimmo is batting .317 over his past 11 games, with six extra-base hits, seven RBIs and six runs. His average remains low -- .228 -- but his .770 OPS is second highest among Mets, trailing DJ Stewart (.813).\n\nNimmo provided the big blow in the series opener at Busch Stadium at an opportune time, in the half-inning after the Mets blew a three-run lead. Righthander Andrew Kittredge, one of St. Louis' late-game shutdown relievers, left a slider over the inner third of the plate. Nimmo hooked it into the rightfield stands.\n\nA day after his first blown save since May 2022, Edwin Diaz tossed a perfect bottom of the ninth. Jake Diekman handled the seventh and Adam Ottavino got the eighth during a low-stress, uneventful late-inning sequence following Nimmo's shot.\n\nSetting up the late excitement were even efforts from Mets lefthander Sean Manaea and Cardinals righthander Kyle Gibson, who had matching lines: six innings, three runs.\n\nStaked to a 3-0 lead, Manaea gave it back in the bottom of the sixth. Willson Contreras ended the shutout bid with an RBI double ripped down the leftfield line. Ivan Herrera's two-out, two-run double eked past centerfielder Brandon Nimmo to tie the game.\n\nMuch better for Manaea (3.31 ERA) this time around: his control of the strike zone. One walk represented Manaea's lowest total in that column in any sort that season; entering the game, he was averaging 5.5 walks per nine innings, more than double his career average.\n\nThat lone free pass was to Paul Goldschmidt, who wound up scoring the tying run, during the sixth-inning sequence.\n\nThe Mets struck for a run in the first inning on DJ Stewart's two-out double. They added two more in the fifth when a pair of singles and Lars Nootbaar's fielding error set them up with two runners in scoring position and no outs. Starling Marte came through with an RBI groundout, Francisco Lindor a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Mets (17-18) played most of the game without Pete Alonso, who was out of the lineup for the first time all season because manager Carlos Mendoza wanted to give him a day off -- or part of a day off. He wound up entering the game in the bottom of the sixth, replacing Joey Wendle in the batting order.\n\nThe impetus for the brief benching: Alonso's slump, including a 1-for-his-last-29 stretch entering the day.\n\n\"I told him I'd much rather be in there than not,\" Alonso said before the game. \"But I totally respect his decision. I respect his decision and he said be ready because there's a ton of scenarios where you come into the game and impact the game in the later innings.

These results have my Mets vs. Cardinals predictions in a tizzy.\n\nThe MLB odds say the opener should be a tight one as Sean Manaea toes the rubber against Kyle Gibson but what do my MLB picks say for Monday, May 6?\n\nStarters Sean Manaea and Kyle Gibson come into this matchup pitching fairly well with solid sub-4.00 ERAs, however, both could be in for a bit of a regression soon but one team is better equipped to make that happen tonight.\n\nManaea has gotten his season off to a solid start. Outside of getting tagged for six earned runs in a start against the Kansas City Royals, the lefty has given up four earned runs over his other five starts. That's good for a 3.07 ERA, but his command has been a bit of a problem.\n\nThe New York Mets' southpaw is walking a lot of batters and getting that pitch count elevated quickly. As a result, his expected ERA is sitting at 4.77 and in the 25th percentile.\n\nLuckily, the St. Louis Cardinals have been pretty terrible at producing runs against left-handed pitchers. St. Louis is hitting just .180 as a team vs. lefties. That's dead last in baseball. The Cards also rank 29th in OPS and wRC+.\n\nOn the other side, Gibson has allowed two runs or fewer in four of his six starts and pitched into at least the sixth inning in all of those. But Gibson is also a pitcher dealing with control issues which can lead to hits and walks. His 5.58 xERA and .272 opponent-expected batting average rank in the 12th and 22nd percentile among MLB pitchers respectively.\n\nWhile the Cards have struggled vs. southpaws, the Mets have been surprisingly effective against righties. They rank 11th in wRC+ and 16th in batting average vs. right-handed pitchers this season.\n\nWith that in mind I like the Mets to have the lead through five innings.\n\nIn that same mindset let's add the Over 4.5 first-five inning total to this same-game parlay. While the Cardinals' numbers against left-handers have been downright atrocious, they still have players like Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt in the lineup. Players who should still be capable of turning things around.\n\nNow, I took Sean Manaea to go Under 16.5 outs recorded in my MLB Player Props article earlier today, but that number has come down, so instead let's look at Gibson to go Over his walks allowed prop.\n\nGibson has handed out two or more free passes in five of his six starts this season and the Mets have the sixth-highest walk rate in baseball. Over 1.5 walks for Gibson looks as solid as bets come.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Mets have hit the Run Line in 31 of their last 50 games for +13.90 Units and a 22% ROI.

The game will be made up Aug. 5, which was originally the lone off-day for the Mets during a West Coast trek.\n\n\"It's part of it,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"It's what we do. We'll be ready for it. We'll worry about that when we get there.\"\n\nThe state of the Mets -- and slugger Pete Alonso in particular -- was less worrisome following consecutive wins over the Cardinals. Alonso, who entered Tuesday in a 2-for-37 slump over his previous 11 games, went 2-for-5 with the tie-breaking two-run double in the fifth and an insurance solo homer in the ninth in the 7-5 victory.\n\n\"It was really nice to be able to help in the manner that I did,\" Alonso said after the Mets won two straight for the first time since a six-game winning streak from Apr. 14-20.\n\nThe Braves' visit to New York will be their first this season. They dropped two of three to the Mets from April 8-11 -- Atlanta's first series loss against its archrivals since August 2022.\n\nAtlanta was off Thursday after completing a two-game interleague sweep of the host Boston Red Sox on Wednesday night, when Marcell Ozuna homered twice in a 5-0 win.\n\nThe Braves are hoping those two wins sparked a slumping offense. Atlanta lost six of eight entering the series against Boston, a span in which it averaged just 2.5 runs per game.\n\nAtlanta won Tuesday's opener 4-2 before Ozuna and Orlando Arcia hit back-to-back homers during a four-inning first Wednesday night.

Ottavino allowed a leadoff home run to Lars Nootbaar before allowing two base runners with one out. the veteran reliever would lock down the save when he struck out Goldschmidt and Burelson to end the game.\n\n-Contreras, the Cardinals veteran catcher, left the game after Martinez hit his wrist/arm with a swing on catcher's interference in the second inning. The Cardinals announced that Contreras suffered a left arm fracture.\n\nthe 31-year-old catcher was having a great offensive season for the Red Birds. He slashed .280/.398/.949 with six home runs and 12 RBI.\n\nBefore Tuesday's game, Alonso had just one hit in his past eight starts.

The Cardinals then got two on base before Ottavino struck out Paul Goldschmidt and Burleson to end the game.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burleson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burleson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Nootbaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lars Nootbaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Mikolas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Mikolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez's swing. Contreras, a three-time All-Star, is hitting .280 with a team-leading six home runs and 12 RBIs.\n\nJos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 allowed three runs in five innings as the Mets won their second consecutive game. All three runs he permitted came in the first, but Butt\u00f3 (1-2) retired nine of his last 10 batters. He yielded five hits, struck out three and walked three.\n\nCole Sulser gave up a solo homer to Alec Burleson in the sixth, Jorge L\u00f3pez pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh and Reed Garrett worked a scoreless eighth for New York. Adam Ottavino allowed a solo homer to Lars Nootbaar, but earned his first save of the season.\n\nNimmo's three-run homer off Miles Mikolas, a 440-foot drive to straightaway center field, tied it 3-all in the fifth. Nimmo, who hit a go-ahead homer Monday, also made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Nolan Gorman of a hit in the fourth.\n\nNimmo's dinger was the third of six straight hits to start the inning as the Mets sent 11 batters to the plate in the fifth. Pete Alonso ended slumps of 1 for 32 and 2 for 39 with a two-run double and scored on Martinez's single to give New York a 6-3 lead.\n\nAlonso added a solo homer off Chris Roycroft, who was making his major league debut, in the ninth.\n\nBrendan Donovan drove Butt\u00f3's fourth pitch 407 feet over the right-center wall. It was Donovan's second career leadoff homer.\n\nThe Cardinals plated two more in the first inning on Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Burleson to take a 3-0 lead.\n\nMikolas (2-5) allowed six runs and nine hits in four-plus innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: RHP Tylor Megill (right shoulder strain) pitched four scoreless innings, striking out seven and walking just one on 62 pitches during a rehab start at Triple-A Syracuse. ... RHP Kodai Senga (right shoulder capsule strain) is expected to throw a bullpen Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nCardinals: INF/DH Matt Carpenter (right oblique strain) had a pair of hits, including a two-run homer, in his first rehab game at Triple-A Memphis.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Cardinals will send out RHP Sonny Gray (4-1, 0.89 ERA) against LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA) and the Mets in the finale of the three-game series on Wednesday. Gray's ERA is the lowest by a Cardinals pitcher in his first five starts with the team since 1910.

LOUIS (AP) -- Brandon Nimmo hit a three-run homer to spark a six-run fifth inning, and the New York Mets rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-5 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Cardinals not only dropped their fourth straight game, but also lost catcher Willson Contreras to a broken left forearm in the second inning after he was hit by J.D. Martinez's swing. Contreras, a three-time All-Star, is hitting .280 with a team-leading six home runs and 12 RBIs.\n\nJos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 allowed three runs in five innings as the Mets won their second consecutive game. All three runs he permitted came in the first, but Butt\u00f3 (1-2) retired nine of his last 10 batters. He yielded five hits, struck out three and walked three.\n\nCole Sulser gave up a solo homer to Alec Burleson in the sixth, Jorge L\u00f3pez pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh and Reed Garrett worked a scoreless eighth for New York. Adam Ottavino allowed a solo homer to Lars Nootbaar, but earned his first save of the season.\n\nNimmo's three-run homer off Miles Mikolas, a 440-foot drive to straightaway center field, tied it 3-all in the fifth. Nimmo, who hit a go-ahead homer Monday, also made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Nolan Gorman of a hit in the fourth.\n\nNimmo's dinger was the third of six straight hits to start the inning as the Mets sent 11 batters to the plate in the fifth. Pete Alonso ended slumps of 1 for 32 and 2 for 39 with a two-run double and scored on Martinez's single to give New York a 6-3 lead.\n\nAlonso added a solo homer off Chris Roycroft, who was making his major league debut, in the ninth.\n\nBrendan Donovan drove Butt\u00f3's fourth pitch 407 feet over the right-center wall. It was Donovan's second career leadoff homer.\n\nThe Cardinals plated two more in the first inning on Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Burleson to take a 3-0 lead.\n\nMikolas (2-5) allowed six runs and nine hits in four-plus innings.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@amny.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mikolas allowed two runs on seven hits, including Tomas Nito's solo homer, in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nJ.D. Martinez hit an RBI double against Mikolas, who struck out five batters and walked none in the game. Mikolas is 2-3 with a 4.46 ERA in seven career games against the Mets, including six starts.\n\nButto (0-2, 2.57 ERA) took the loss on April 26, which was his first career start against the Cardinals. He allowed four runs on four hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings, striking out four. Willson Contreras and Alec Burleson hit solo home runs against him.\n\n\"I just made two mistakes in the beginning, but I just continued working, continued battling,\" Butto said.\n\nBoth Mikolas and Butto are coming off strong efforts in their most recent outings.\n\nMikolas met the quality-start metric in a 4-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday, allowing three runs on six hits in six innings. He struck out four and walked none while throwing a season-high 101 pitches.\n\n\"We've played a lot of close games,\" Mikolas said. \"If we get a ball that's a foot more to the left or right, maybe it's a fair ball down the line and it's extra bases. But for us, it seems to be a foul ball or a line drive turns into a double play. ... Over the course of the season, I think a lot of those things have a tendency to even out.\"\n\nButto took a hard-luck 1-0 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday. He yielded one run on four hits and two walks over six innings while striking out six batters.\n\nMets slugger Pete Alonso, who is mired in a 1-for-30 slump, figures to return to the starting lineup Tuesday. He entered Monday's game in the sixth inning as a defensive replacement at first base and lined out in his only at-bat.\n\n\"He's struggling, but it wasn't easy to give him a day,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"But that says who he is. Whether he's feeling it, whether he's not feeling himself at the plate, he still wants to be there.\"\n\nThe Cardinals have lost five of their past six games while struggling at the plate. They have scored three or fewer runs in six of their past eight games.\n\n\"There's not a magic button, man, there really isn't,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"I'd love to sit here and tell you the perfect answer. If there was one, the guys would be doing it.\"\n\nBefore the Monday game, the Cardinals altered their bullpen, placing Giovanny Gallegos on the 15-day injured list due to a right shoulder impingement and promoting Chris Roycroft from the minors. Roycroft, a 26-year-old right-hander who was never drafted, had a 1.38 ERA in 11 appearances for Triple-A Memphis this season.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "centredaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Centre Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@centredaily.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Mikolas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miles Mikolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Mets scored six of their seven runs in the fifth inning in their 7-5 win over the Cardinals.\n\nBrandon Nimmo homered again for the second straight game to jumpstart the scoring in the frame. With the Mets trailing 3-0, the outfielder launched a three-run shot to center field field, his fifth long ball of the season. More good news for the Mets came when Pete Alonso stepped up to the plate and lined what appeared to be a two-run slump-busting double down the right-field line to give them a 5-3 lead. The first baseman later homered in the ninth to give the club some insurance.\n\nAlonso had entered Tuesday with one hit in his last 30 at-bats and Tuesday's big night was likely a big sigh of relief. JD Martinez capped off the scoring with a single up the middle to bring in Alonso.\n\nJose Butto was solid for the Mets keeping them in the game while appearing to lack his best stuff. The right-hander tossed five innings allowing three runs on five hits while walking three and striking out three. Butto's ERA sits at a strong 3.00 on the season.\n\nAlonso's homer in the ninth provided some cushion, however, Adam Ottavino pitched into and out of a scary situation. After allowing a solo homer to make it a 7-5 game, the right-hander worked into a runners on first and second situation and the winning run at the plate and just one away. Ottavino pushed through struck out Paul Goldschmidt and Alec Burleson for the final two outs to secure the victory.\n\nCarlos Mendoza will hand the ball off to Jose Quintana for the sweep on Wednesday afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Cardinals ace Sonny Gray (0.89 ERA) will toe-off against the southpaw to try and salvage the series.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_o_connell@nydailynews.com", "name": "James O'Connell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burleson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burleson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24129087045066.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544734", "eventUri": "eng-9544734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

They're then scheduled to host the Phillies (26-12) for two games on Monday and Tuesday before traveling to Philly for two more games on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"We know they're good teams, but we're a good team, too,\" Mendoza said Wednesday. \"We'll be up for the challenge. The guys will be ready to go.\"\n\nThe Mets are set to face two of the best pitchers on an Atlanta staff that lost ace Spencer Strider to season-ending elbow surgery.\n\nFriday's matchup features Braves veteran Charlie Morton (2-0, 3.50 ERA) against the Mets' Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA), who is coming off a season-worst start against the Rays in which he surrendered eight runs on 10 hits over 2.2 innings.\n\nSaturday afternoon, meanwhile, is set to be the Citi Field debut of Christian Scott, the Mets' prized pitching prospect who dazzled with six strikeouts while limiting the Rays to one run over 6.2 innings in his MLB debut last weekend.\n\n\"It'll be electric,\" Mendoza predicted of Scott's first home game. \"Just watching our fans here in St. Louis and Tampa, how much they would cheer for him, I'm pretty sure there's going to be a lot of people looking forward to watch Scotty pitch at Citi Field. I'm expecting a big-time crowd and a lot of support.\"\n\nLeft-hander Max Fried, a 2022 All-Star who is 2-1 with a 4.23 ERA this season, is scheduled to pitch for Atlanta on Saturday.\n\nThe Mets then expect to turn to Luis Severino (2-2, 2.93 ERA) for Sunday afternoon's series finale, while the Braves plan to go with Bryce Elder (1-1, 5.28 ERA). In his last start at Citi Field, Severino took a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the Cubs on April 29.\n\nIn their first meeting of the season last month, the Mets took two out of three from the Braves in Atlanta. The Braves, who boast back-to-back seasons with at least 101 wins, are averaging 5.0 runs per game on offense, even with several of their star players off to uncharacteristically slow starts.\n\nReigning NL MVP Ronald Acuna Jr., who last year became the first MLB player with at least 40 home runs and 70 stolen bases in a single season, enters the weekend with only two home runs and eight RBI. His .261 average is well below last season's .337, while his .720 OPS is a far cry from last year's 1.012.\n\nMatt Olson, who led MLB hitters with 54 home runs and 139 RBI in 2023, has only three homers and 16 RBI this year. Ozzie Albies, whose 33 home runs last year were the most by a second baseman, has just two thus far.\n\nLeading the Atlanta offense is Marcell Ozuna, whose 12 home runs and 38 RBI to begin Thursday both led the majors. Ozuna recorded exactly 40 home runs and 100 RBI last year.\n\nThe Mets, too, have endured early-season slumps from several of their top players, including Francisco Lindor, who is hitting .211, and Pete Alonso, who broke out of a 1-for-32 slide with a double and a home run in Tuesday's win over the Cardinals.\n\n\"It was really nice to have a positive impact on the game,\" Alonso said afterward. \"I'm just really happy to contribute.\"\n\nNext week's home-and-home sets with the Phillies mark the Mets' first time seeing Philadelphia in 2024.\n\nThe Philles, who own baseball's best record, are one of two teams to rank within the top five in runs scored (191) and team ERA (3.26). The other, the Los Angeles Dodgers, have the NL's second-best record of 26-13.\n\nBryce Harper, the former outfielder who converted to a full-time first baseman this season, has nine home runs for Philadelphia, as does Kyle Schwarber. Alec Bohm's .346 average is the fourth-best in the majors -- and one spot ahead of teammate Trea Turner's .343.\n\nThe Mets will likely avoid Phillies ace -- and old friend -- Zack Wheeler (4-3, 1.64 ERA), who is scheduled to pitch Sunday against the Marlins.\n\nWheeler dealt with injuries during much of his seven-year Mets career but has been a model of durability and dominance since signing with Philadelphia before the 2020 season. He signed a three-year, $126 million extension in March.\n\nThe Mets are expected to see Philadelphia's other All-Star arm, right-hander Aaron Nola (4-2, 3.67 ERA), on Tuesday. New York has not announced its pitching plans for the games against the Phillies, who advanced to the World Series in 2022 and to a Game 7 in the NLCS last year.\n\nThe series against the Braves and Phillies should show the Mets how they currently stack up against baseball's best teams. They rebounded from last weekend's three-game sweep by the Rays (19-19) in Tampa by going undefeated in St. Louis, where Wednesday's series finale was postponed due to rain.\n\nAfter an 0-5 start, the Mets are 18-13 and have won seven of 10 series, including taking two of three from the Dodgers in Los Angeles last month.\n\n\"We can definitely play with anybody,\" Mendoza said Wednesday, \"and the guys know that.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@nydailynews.com", "name": "Peter Sblendorio", "type":

Fermin bounced an 86-mph changeup past the third base bag.\n\nAs Mets third baseman Brett Baty tried to make a play, he crashed hard into third base umpire Doug Eddings.\n\nBoth men appeared to get up from the collision unscathed.

LOUIS -- Brandon Nimmo hit a three-run homer to spark a six-run fifth inning, and the New York Mets rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-5 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Cardinals not only dropped their fourth straight game, but also lost catcher Willson Contreras to a broken left forearm in the second inning after he was hit by J.D. Martinez's swing. Contreras, a three-time All-Star, is hitting .280 with a team-leading 6 home runs and 12 RBI.\n\nJose Butto allowed three runs in five innings as the Mets won their second consecutive game. All three runs he permitted came in the first, but Butto (1-2) retired nine of his last 10 batters. He yielded 5 hits, struck out 3 and walked 3.\n\nCole Sulser gave up a solo homer to Alec Burleson in the sixth, Jorge Lopez pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh and Reed Garrett worked a scoreless eighth for New York. Adam Ottavino allowed a solo homer to Lars Nootbaar, but earned his first save of the season.\n\nNimmo's three-run homer off Miles Mikolas, a 440-foot drive to straightaway center field, tied it 3-3 in the fifth. Nimmo, who hit a go-ahead homer Monday, also made a diving catch in the outfield to rob Nolan Gorman of a hit in the fourth.\n\nNimmo's dinger was the third of six straight hits to start the inning as the Mets sent 11 batters to the plate in the fifth. Pete Alonso ended slumps of 1 for 32 and 2 for 39 with a two-run double and scored on Martinez's single to give New York a 6-3 lead.\n\nAlonso added a solo homer off Chris Roycroft, who was making his major league debut, in the ninth.\n\nBrendan Donovan drove Butto's fourth pitch 407 feet over the right-center wall. It was Donovan's second career leadoff homer.\n\nThe Cardinals scored two more in the first inning on Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly and an RBI single by Burleson to take a 3-0 lead.\n\nMikolas (2-5) allowed 6 runs and 9 hits in 4-plus innings.\n\nDIAMONDBACKS 6, REDS 2 Zac Gallen threw six shutout innings in his first start in 11 days and Corbin Carroll had a three-run homer and five RBI as Arizona dealt host Cincinnati its sixth straight loss.\n\nCUBS 3, PADRES 2 Michael Busch led off the ninth inning with a game-ending home run, Cody Bellinger went deep in his return from broken ribs and host Chicago beat San Diego.\n\nGIANTS 5, ROCKIES 0 Kyle Harrison pitched seven scoreless innings and visiting San Francisco scored four runs in a decisive fourth inning despite getting only two balls out of the infield in a victory over Colorado.\n\nAMERICAN LEAGUE\n\nYANKEES 10, ASTROS 3 Alex Verdugo homered and tied a career high with four RBI, powering host New York past Houston. Anthony Volpe and Giancarlo Stanton also went deep as the Yankees won their fourth straight game. Volpe finished with three RBI and Juan Soto had three hits.\n\nRAYS 5, WHITE SOX 1 Zach Eflin allowed one run and six hits in seven innings as host Tampa Bay beat Chicago for its fifth consecutive win.\n\nTIGERS 11, GUARDIANS 7 Andy Ibanez homered his first two times up and drove in four runs and Ryan Vilade got his first major league hit and three RBI in his debut for visiting Detroit. Ibanez homered on the third pitch of the game and added a three-run shot in the second. He hit a double in the eighth inning and finished 4 for 4 with a walk and four runs.\n\nMARINERS 10, TWINS 6 Josh Rojas and Ty France each hit an RBI single during Seattle's four-run ninth inning in a win over host Minnesota. Cal Raleigh connected for a pinch-hit grand slam in the seventh for Seattle, which has won 3 of 4.\n\nBREWERS 6, ROYALS 5 Willy Adames hit a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning, helping Milwaukee defeat host Kansas City.\n\nINTERLEAGUE\n\nPHILLIES 10, BLUE JAYS 1 Bryce Harper hit a grand slam, Cristopher Sanchez pitched seven strong innings and red-hot Philadelphia routed visiting Toronto. Kody Clemens homered, tripled and drove in four runs for the Phillies, who have won seven straight games, 11 in a row at home and 18 of 21 overall.\n\nNATIONALS 3, ORIOLES 0 Trevor Williams struck out eight in five scoreless innings, and host Washington stole four bases in a victory over Corbin Burnes and Baltimore, lifting the Nationals above .500 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nBRAVES 6, RED SOX 2 Marcell Ozuna's run-scoring single in the eighth inning gave host Atlanta the lead and the Braves beat Boston to snap a three-game losing streak. Boston's Kutter Crawford and Atlanta's Reynaldo Lopez each allowed two runs in a matchup of right-handers with ERA's under 2.00.\n\nANGELS 9, PIRATES 0 Kevin Pillar homered twice and drove in six runs, helping Patrick Sandoval and visiting Los Angeles beat Pittsburgh.

Of course, there is plenty of regular season remaining for New York to right the ship, and it may begin with righty Jose Butto who is going to get the start on Tuesday. Despite owning a 2.57 ERA up to this point, Butto has yet to win a game with an 0-2 record through five starts on the young season. Overall, New York is two games below .500 at 16-18 and already sit 7.5 games behind the Atlanta Braves for first place in the NL East.\n\nOn the other side of things, the St. Louis Cardinals entered the 2024 regular season more than motivated to get back on track after 2023 saw them go a lackluster 71-91 after three straight appearances in the NL playoffs. Fast forward 34 games into this season and the ugliness that reared its head a year ago is once again hanging around. With a record of 15-19, St. Louis is playing down to their standards. Then again, the Red Birds did take two of three games against the Mets earlier in the season, and the 'Cards will call upon Miles Mikolas who has struggled to say the least. So far, Mikolas is an underwhelming 2-4 and is equipped with a lofty 5.68 ERA.\n\nIt hasn't been a pretty start for the Mets, but there is still reason to believe that they can get the job done on the road in this one. No matter what happens in game one's contest on Monday evening, the Mets can at least find solace in a steady pitching unit that has played fairly well of late. In large part, New York's struggles have been with some inconsistencies at the plate. Simply put, New York is wasting phenomenal pitching performances due to some poor hitting efforts. If the Mets are going to go out on the road and steal one from the Cardinals, then this type of formula cannot continue to be the case. More specifically, New York cannot falter when scoring opportunities present themselves.\n\nAlthough the Mets may be limping into this series, it is at least encouraging that Jose Butto is putting forth consistent innings from the pitching rubber. While he wasn't expected to pitch this early in the season, he is making the most of his opportunities and will be squaring off with a Cardinals offense that is ranked second-to-last in runs scored throughout all of baseball.\n\nWhy The Cardinals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nSeeking to once again take the series versus the Mets in consecutive outings, there is no question that St. Louis needs all hands on deck to rid themselves of the poor play that has haunted the team to begin the season.\n\nAll in all, it begins with Miles Mikolas figuring out better ways to stay ahead of the count and not fall behind in the count. Previously, when this happened to the 35-year-old veteran, he has surrendered far too much solid contact. Instead, Mikolas would be able to thrive in this matchup if he gets into 0-2 and 1-2 counts making it easier for him to get the youthful and inexperienced Mets lineup to chase pitches outside of the zone. In fact, Mikolas is coming off a promising start versus the Detroit Tigers in which he logged in six innings pitched on his way to giving up only three runs in the process. If Mikolas can string together a couple of scoreless frames to begin the game, then he could be tough for the Mets to get to.\n\nWhat is wrong with St. Louis' offense? It isn't necessarily time to hit the panic button, but the dynamic duo of Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado have combined for a measly four home runs which simply isn't going to cut it. If these two stars can begin to start tearing the cover off of the baseball, then St. Louis will be that much more dangerous to deal with for the rest of the MLB.\n\nFinal Mets-Cardinals Prediction & Pick\n\nWithout a doubt, both teams enter his series in a drought offensively. While it is hard to imagine that this will last for too much longer, take the Cardinals to defend their home field and rely on the veteran presence of Miles Mikolas to get the job done.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_conant@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Griffin Conant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Mikolas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miles Mikolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mets-vs.-Cardinals-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544734", "eventUri": "eng-9544734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Mikolas allowed two runs on seven hits, including Tomas Nito's solo homer, in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nJ.D. Martinez hit an RBI double against Mikolas, who struck out five batters and walked none in the game. Mikolas is 2-3 with a 4.46 ERA in seven career games against the Mets, including six starts.\n\nButto (0-2, 2.57 ERA) took the loss on April 26, which was his first career start against the Cardinals. He allowed four runs on four hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings, striking out four. Willson Contreras and Alec Burleson hit solo home runs against him.\n\n\"I just made two mistakes in the beginning, but I just continued working, continued battling,\" Butto said.\n\nBoth Mikolas and Butto are coming off strong efforts in their most recent outings.\n\nMikolas met the quality-start metric in a 4-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday, allowing three runs on six hits in six innings. He struck out four and walked none while throwing a season-high 101 pitches.\n\n\"We've played a lot of close games,\" Mikolas said. \"If we get a ball that's a foot more to the left or right, maybe it's a fair ball down the line and it's extra bases. But for us, it seems to be a foul ball or a line drive turns into a double play. ... Over the course of the season, I think a lot of those things have a tendency to even out.\"\n\nButto took a hard-luck 1-0 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday. He yielded one run on four hits and two walks over six innings while striking out six batters.\n\nMets slugger Pete Alonso, who is mired in a 1-for-30 slump, figures to return to the starting lineup Tuesday. He entered Monday's game in the sixth inning as a defensive replacement at first base and lined out in his only at-bat.\n\n\"He's struggling, but it wasn't easy to give him a day,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"But that says who he is. Whether he's feeling it, whether he's not feeling himself at the plate, he still wants to be there.\"\n\nThe Cardinals have lost five of their past six games while struggling at the plate. They have scored three or fewer runs in six of their past eight games.\n\n\"There's not a magic button, man, there really isn't,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"I'd love to sit here and tell you the perfect answer. If there was one, the guys would be doing it.\"\n\nBefore the Monday game, the Cardinals altered their bullpen, placing Giovanny Gallegos on the 15-day injured list due to a right shoulder impingement and promoting Chris Roycroft from the minors.

LOUIS CARDINALS\n\nShow someone a club cruising and crushing on offense, and they'll show you a confident team.\n\nShow someone a club laboring or languishing on offense.\n\nAnd that'll be the Cardinals. With another quality start on the mound from another of the new pitchers added this offseason to provide exactly that, the Cardinals rallied together to score three runs in one inning and did little else in the other eight. Their sudden bounty tied the game but fell short of taking the game when they lost, 4-3, to the New York Mets on Monday at Busch Stadium. Brandon Nimmo's solo homer off reliever Andrew Kittredge was the difference in the game, but the difference for the Cardinals remains a punchless lineup.\n\nIn 35 games this season they've scored exactly three runs 11 times and three or fewer 22 times. They are 6-16 in those games. Players throughout the clubhouse and the manager in his office have called the lack of scoring \"frustrating.\" Offense is the effervescent of any club, and without it things feel flat.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Rivian receives $827M state incentive package to expand operations in Normal\n\n\"I think pitching can do a really good job of bringing consistency to a team, but offense and what those guys do on the field brings confidence to a team,\" starting pitcher Kyle Gibson said. \"From a pitching side, we cannot do that. They're going to have confidence in us. They're going to have confidence in who we are but when they get rolling offensively that's really where a team offensively and position players get confidence. I think that's the hardest part. We know they're putting in the work. We know they're really good players and it just hasn't clicked for them. I think that's really the gist of it.\n\n\"When these guys get going, I think you see that confidence. You see that swagger.\"\n\nAll the Cardinals showed early Monday as they began hosting a three-game visit from the Mets was swings that are out of sort and off-kilter, at-bats that were unproductive.\n\nBut they were also over quick. Gibson needed 40 pitches to get the first six outs of his start while Mets lefty Sean Manaea had four outs before he threw his 19th pitch. As Manaea held them scoreless through the first five games, the Cardinals completed at-bats in three or fewer pitches seven times and they were 2 for 7 in those spots. Toss in the six at bats that that lasted four pitches and the Cardinals were 3 for 13. In a game that took 2 hours, 25 minutes, Manaea (2-1) was through five innings in around 70 minutes.\n\n\"I thought early on, at-bats weren't great,\" manager Oliver Marmol said. \"I didn't feel like the at-bats were extremely competitive. ... You don't get beat 0-0. You don't get (beat) 2-0, 3-1. I think there's an identity to that. If you're going to let it eat, you want to miss a certain way in hitters' counts. I do think certain guys took competitive at-bats. Overall, just not stringing them together. The quality wasn't there early on.\"\n\nWhat the Cardinals have lacked through these early weeks of the season has been gusto from the middle of the order and consistent slugging throughout. The only team with a worse batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage than the Cardinals just visited the Cardinals this past weekend and won two of three games at Busch. The White Sox did that by holding the Cardinals to one run Sunday and punchless with the bases loaded in the 10th inning Sunday.\n\nIncluding their 1 for 6 on Monday with runners in scoring position, the Cardinals are 10 for 55 (.181) with runners in scoring position over the past eight games.\n\nThey're overall average is shriveling to .200.\n\n\"I don't think an offense that is not in a good spot in general is somehow going to do better with runners in scoring position,\" Marmol said. \"If guys are in between and not feeling the way they need to feel, then a runner on second doesn't do a whole lot. It's not our issue. When you look at our ability to drive the baseball and slug and actually swing at pitches in the heart of the plate, hit them hard and hit them far - that's more of an issue than just situational hitting. They both have their place. Don't get me wrong. I'm a believer in situational hitting. That's not the story here.\"\n\nThe story is increasingly one that Marmol and others spoke about earlier Monday, saw in inaction Monday night, and will again try to solve ahead of Tuesday's game.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Baseball Sports Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of

'Confidence,' 'swagger'", "body": "Show someone a club cruising and crushing on offense, and they'll show you a confident team.\n\nShow someone a club laboring or languishing on offense.\n\nAnd that'll be the Cardinals.\n\nWith another quality start on the mound from another of the new pitchers added this offseason to provide exactly that, the Cardinals rallied together to score three runs in one inning and did little else in the other eight. Their sudden bounty tied the game but fell short of taking the game when they lost, 4-3, to the New York Mets on Monday at Busch Stadium. Brandon Nimmo's solo homer off reliever Andrew Kittredge was the difference in the game, but the difference for the Cardinals remains a punchless lineup.\n\nIn 35 games this season they've scored exactly three runs 11 times and three or fewer 22 times. They are 6-16 in those games. Players throughout the clubhouse and the manager in his office have called the lack of scoring \"frustrating.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

They're going to have confidence in us. They're going to have confidence in who we are but when they get rolling offensively that's really where a team offensively and position players get confidence. I think that's the hardest part. We know they're putting in the work. We know they're really good players and it just hasn't clicked for them. I think that's really the gist of it.\n\n\"When these guys get going, I think you see that confidence. You see that swagger.\"\n\nAll the Cardinals showed early Monday as they began hosting a three-game visit from the Mets was swings that are out of sort and off-kilter, at-bats that were unproductive.\n\nBut they were also over quick.\n\nGibson needed 40 pitches to get the first six outs of his start while Mets lefty Sean Manaea had four outs before he threw his 19th pitch. As Manaea held them scoreless through the first five games, the Cardinals completed at-bats in three or fewer pitches seven times and they were 2 for 7 in those spots. Toss in the six at-bats that that lasted four pitches and the Cardinals were 3 for 13. In a game that took 2 hours, 25 minutes, Manaea (2-1) was through five innings in around 70 minutes.\n\n\"I thought early on, at-bats weren't great,\" manager Oliver Marmol said. \"I didn't feel like the at-bats were extremely competitive. ... You don't get beat 0-0. You don't get (beat) 2-0, 3-1. I think there's an identity to that. If you're going to let it eat, you want to miss a certain way in hitters' counts. I do think certain guys took competitive at-bats. Overall, just not stringing them together. The quality wasn't there early on.\"\n\nWhat the Cardinals have lacked through these early weeks of the season has been gusto from the middle of the order and consistent slugging throughout. The only team with a worse batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage than the Cardinals just visited the Cardinals this past weekend and won two of three games at Busch. The White Sox did that by holding the Cardinals to one run Sunday and punchless with the bases loaded in the 10th inning Sunday.\n\nIncluding their 1 for 6 on Monday with runners in scoring position, the Cardinals are 10 for 55 (.181) with runners in scoring position over the past eight games.\n\nThey're overall average is shriveling to .200.\n\n\"I don't think an offense that is not in a good spot in general is somehow going to do better with runners in scoring position,\" Marmol said. \"If guys are in between and not feeling the way they need to feel, then a runner on second doesn't do a whole lot. It's not our issue. When you look at our ability to drive the baseball and slug and actually swing at pitches in the heart of the plate, hit them hard and hit them far - that's more of an issue than just situational hitting. They both have their place. Don't get me wrong. I'm a believer in situational hitting. That's not the story here.\"\n\nThe story is increasingly one that Marmol and others spoke about earlier Monday, saw in inaction Monday night, and will again try to solve ahead of Tuesday's game.\n\nIn advantage counts and against the most delicious of pitches, the Cardinals are not \"hitting them hard and hitting them far.\" The Cardinals, as Ben Frederickson detailed in a column for Tuesday's Post-Dispatch, have seen the second-highest percentage of \"meatball\" pitches in the majors, per Statcast data. They have swung at them with the third-lowest rate. Other indicators of the lack of power are just as telling. As a team, they do not pull the ball much and when they do it's not for much power, and they do not strike the fastball with much authority.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nTheir hard-hit rate (36.7%) is the second-lowest in the National League. They're creating runs at a rate 17% less than league average.\n\nPrefer baseball card stats?\n\nThey have hit the fewest homers in the majors.\n\nThey are almost averaging 50 at-bats for every one home run. Twenty-four clubs, on average, hit one in every 38 at-bats or fewer. The Cardinals' slugging percentage (.332) is less than the on-base percentage of the Dodgers (.356).\n\nAll of this paint by numbers creates the same picture.\n\n\"There's not a magic button, man,\" Marmol said. \"There really isn't. I would love to sit here and tell you the answer. If there was one the guys would be doing it.\"\n\nGibson, the starting pitcher, added: \"It's going to be over a few games. Getting to where you feel like yourself and normal - that doesn't happen by forcing it. You've just got to keep putting in the work. That's what these guys are doing. Maybe people don't like to hear that. ... To go out there and try to turn around a season, the only thing you can turnaround in one game is a series, a three-game series. Tomorrow we can turn around the series and make it 1-1. And that's all you can do in one game. No one is going to go out there and turn around their season in one game. It's so easy to think today has to be the day.\"\n\nThe Cardinals did almost turn around a game in an inning.\n\nIn his six innings, Gibson allowed four hits on his changeup and was frustrated that he \"gave up so many hits on one pitch.\" The Mets scored with two outs in the first and scored twice the fifth after an error in right field by Lars Nootbaar. The Cardinals' outfielder said he tried to deke the runner at first base by playing the line drive tight, as if he was going to catch it. That put him in a vulnerable spot when a sharp hop got past his glove. The Mets used two productive outs to score twice and take a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning.\n\nUnable to do much against Manaea to that point, the Cardinals got started with their first-time leadoff hitter. Jose Fermin threaded a single to left field. Willson Contreras followed with a double down the left-field line to score Fermin. Paul Goldschmidt drew a walk, and the Cardinals had the tying run on base with no outs and the middle of the order up. The real bonanza passed. Rookie Ivan Herrera salvaged the inning with a two-run double, and then he ended the inning by being thrown out trying to take third.\n\n\"Hitting is contagious,\" Nootbaar said. \"I don't think it's a coincidence we scored three runs in one inning. You get that feeling of - you see the ball land and guys start rolling a little bit. It's that momentum. That's the biggest thing. I always say that hitting is the most contagious thing there is. So when you start to feel that infectious energy and you start to feel guys doing that I guess that momentum kind of grows a little bit.\"\n\nIt just hasn't spread yet.\n\nNot within games.\n\nNot throughout the lineup.\n\nOf the Cardinals past 13 RBIs, 11 have come from Contreras, Herrera, or Nolan Arenado.\n\nConfidence doesn't carry if consolidated.\n\n\"Rarely do you go through a season where you have a lot of guys not feeling good where they're at, and it's unfortunate that we've probably been going through one of those,\" Gibson said. \"I don't think there's a guy in here who believes any different about ourselves than we did March 27. I know that might sound crazy. We sign up for 162 games and that's what we're going to do. Sometimes those statements can come off as complacency, can come off as chalking it up to bad luck. I don't think this group is doing that.\n\n\"I do know that day in, day out, when a team is scoring runs and when a team is hitting the way it wants,\" Gibson added, \"it's a more confident bunch. How can it not be?\"\n\nPhotos: St. Louis Cardinals fall to New York Mets in St. Louis\n\nDerrick Goold\n\n@dgoold on X (formerly Twitter)\n\ndgoold@post-dispatch.com\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

The game will be made up Aug. 5, which was originally the lone off-day for the Mets during a West Coast trek.\n\n\"It's part of it,\" Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \"It's what we do. We'll be ready for it. We'll worry about that when we get there.\"\n\nThe state of the Mets -- and slugger Pete Alonso in particular -- was less worrisome following consecutive wins over the Cardinals. Alonso, who entered Tuesday in a 2-for-37 slump over his previous 11 games, went 2-for-5 with the tie-breaking two-run double in the fifth and an insurance solo homer in the ninth in the 7-5 victory.\n\n\"It was really nice to be able to help in the manner that I did,\" Alonso said after the Mets won two straight for the first time since a six-game winning streak from Apr. 14-20.\n\nThe Braves' visit to New York will be their first this season. They dropped two of three to the Mets from April 8-11 -- Atlanta's first series loss against its archrivals since August 2022.\n\nAtlanta was off Thursday after completing a two-game interleague sweep of the host Boston Red Sox on Wednesday night, when Marcell Ozuna homered twice in a 5-0 win.\n\nThe Braves are hoping those two wins sparked a slumping offense. Atlanta lost six of eight entering the series against Boston, a span in which it averaged just 2.5 runs per game.\n\nAtlanta won Tuesday's opener 4-2 before Ozuna and Orlando Arcia hit back-to-back homers during a four-inning first Wednesday night. The Braves hadn't scored at least four runs in back-to-back games since April 24 and 26.\n\n\"Obviously we took one (Tuesday), which was nice,\" said Braves left-hander Chris Sale, who tossed six scoreless innings Wednesday. \"But (the first inning) kind of put the exclamation of like 'Hey, we're kind of back' offensively.\"\n\nQuintana took the loss in his most recent start May 3, when he gave up eight runs over 2 2/3 innings as the Mets fell 10-8 to the Tampa Bay Rays. He is 3-5 with a 6.55 ERA in nine career starts against the Braves.\n\nMorton didn't factor into the decision May 3 after allowing two runs over six innings as the Braves lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers, 4-3 in 11 innings. He is 6-6 with a 3.71 ERA in 23 games (22 starts) against the Mets.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@bradenton.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Morton_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Morton (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Ozuna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Ozuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Quintana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Quintana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Arcia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Arcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleague_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interleague play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/y8nneu/picture288440561/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/18e7f3a1-31a3-4b4e-a567-0873aefe081c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544734", "eventUri": "eng-9544734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-14", "dateEnd": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 1682, "textEnd": 1692}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-08", "dateEnd": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1801, "textEnd": 1811}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "dateEnd": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2436, "textEnd": 2451}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-05", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 965}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 2734, "textEnd": 2739, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 452987505, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 64, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 64}}}

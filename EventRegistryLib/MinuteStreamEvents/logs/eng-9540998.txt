According to a report published in The Sun, the 12-string guitar had been lying unused in the loft at an undisclosed address in the English countryside for more than 50 years. The guitar may look very ordinary but it once belonged to the singer-songwriter and musician John Lennon. John Lennon (1940-80) was the co-leader of the British rock group the Beatles. The guitar will now be sold in an auction on May 29 and 30 at the Hard Rock Cafe, in New York. John Lennon had given the guitar to 1960s pop star Gordon Waller, who gifted it to its current owner. Gordon is known for tracks like Nobody I Know, I Go To Pieces, etc.\n\nHow did the wood markings help the man to find that the guitar belonged to John Lennon? As per the report, every guitar has a special \"woodgrain\" like a person's fingerprint - and the attic instrument's woodgrain matched Lennon's old guitar.\n\nThe man's father (the original owner of the guitar) had assumed he'd lost the musical instrument - until his son found it while they were moving house. A scrutiny by experts revealed the guitar could fetch more than half a million at auction - because John Lennon once played it. The Beatles group co-leader and his fellow Beatle George Harrison played the guitar in sessions for the band's albums Help! and Rubber Soul.\n\nThe Beatles group co-leader also used the instrument to play the rhythm guitar part on the much-loved Beatles track Norwegian Wood.\n\nIn an interaction with The Sun, Auctioneer Darren Julien talked about this guitar. Darren said, \"Finding this remarkable instrument is like finding a lost Rembrandt or Picasso. He added, \"It still looks and plays like a dream after having been preserved in an attic for more than 50 years.\" Julien added that to awaken this sleeping beauty is a sacred honour. The auctioneer said he expects the guitar to smash its guide price of $800,000 (Rs 66 crore).", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Beatles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-string_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twelve-string guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_I_Know", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobody I Know"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Cafe", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Cafe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help!_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Help!

The storied 12-string acoustic guitar will headline the Music Icons sale that Julien's Auctions is hosting at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City on May 29 and 30.\n\nThe Framus is expected to smash its estimate of $600,000-$800,000, making it the highest of sums anticipated for the sale's other artifacts, which include guitars, stage-worn fashions, and set lists penned by musical stars. In fact, the Framus might become the priciest Beatles guitar ever sold.\n\nThe current record belongs to Lennon's formerly long-lost Gibson J-160E, which Julien's auctioned off for $2.4 million in 2015. While Lennon only played that Gibson through 1963, he favored the Framus Hootenanny throughout 1965, as Beatlemania peaked following their first trip to the U.S.\n\nLennon used this Framus while recording their fifth studio album Help! (1965), on the set of the LP's accompanying film, and while making Rubber Soul. All three dropped the same year.\n\nUntil recently, this guitar was just the stuff of musical myth. According to Julien's Auctions, by the late 1960s, Lennon's Framus was in the hands of singer-songwriter Gordon Waller, who handed it off to the road managers backing his band, Peter & Gordon. For years, unbeknownst to fans, it languished in the attic of its new owner's home in the British countryside.\n\n\"The current owner is still alive and their son discovered this guitar in a box in their attic while helping his elderly parents move from their current two-story home to a single-story house,\" Martin Nolan, the auction house's co-founder and executive director, explained over email.\n\nHe visited the house with Darren Julien, founder of the auction house, to authenticate the guitar -- with help from Beatles experts Andy Babiuk and Danny Bennett. They compared it with archival Beatles imagery, too. \"The woodgrain on the guitar is like the fingerprints of a guitar,\" Nolan said. \"It matches up exactly to the photos and videos of John Lennon and George Harrison playing it. We also photo-matched the synthetic tortoise shell pickguard on this Framus Guitar.\"\n\nThe specimen will hit the block with its original case and a copy of The Beatles: Photographs From The Set of Help, featuring imagery by Italian photographer Emilio Lari.\n\n\"American Woman\" musician Randy Bachman's 200-strong guitar collection will inaugurate the auction on May 29. The rest of the sale will take place the next day, featuring the Framus lot and more -- including the pink Fender U2 bassist Adam Clayton played during their residency at The Sphere; Michael Jackson's stage-worn \"Billie Jean\" jacket from the 1984 Victory Tour; and a Nirvana set list written by Kurt Cobain himself.\n\nSome lots, like Chet Atkins' guitar -- donated by British singer-songwriter Mark Knopfler -- will benefit the The King's Trust. Proceeds from several more will go towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. Highlights across the board, though, will go on view in a public exhibition that will travel from London's Piccadilly Circus to New York's Times Square, ahead of the big sale.", "source": {"uri": "news.artnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "artnet News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jools'_Annual_Hootenanny", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jools' Annual Hootenanny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Framus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Beatles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien's_Auctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julien's Auctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_J-160E", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gibson J-160E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-string_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twelve-string guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Cafe", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Cafe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Gordon", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter and Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help!_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Help!

The case, he explains, \"was in very bad condition, but he kept it perfect.\"\n\n\"It is a beautiful guitar, twelve strings with a beautiful and unusual sound\", tuned by six ivory white pegs, which was used by the Liverpool group when \"they were on the crest of the wave\", says the expert on The Beatles.\n\nLennon, Paul McCartney, Harrison and Ringo Starr were returning from a trip to America, including an appearance on the television program 'The Ed Sullivan Show'. According to Nolan, \"they felt somewhat frustrated with their fame, they were young... This guitar makes extraordinary music, it disappeared and now reappears. It is a piece of art.\"\n\nThe instrument underwent a thorough analysis to confirm its authenticity: \"The wood grain matches, which are like the fingerprints and DNA of the guitar,\" he explains, \"and the synthetic pickguard, which is like a turtle shell, but synthetic.\" \".\n\nIn addition to the physical evidence, photographs were also compared: \"Ringo, John, George and Paul are all there, as well as the snapshots of the guitar with them in the studio... There is no doubt, it is the guitar. \"It's in great condition.\"\n\n\"It is history of our pop culture. It's a great discovery. The Beatles are still one of the most famous bands in the world today,\" says Nolan prior to the bidding.\n\nThe Framus Hootenanny in question was purchased for around 47 pounds (54 euros) in 1964, and now, \"on a conservative estimate, it would fetch 600,000 to 800,000 US dollars (560,000 to 750,000 euros),\" says the CEO of Julien's.\n\nThe auction house managed to set the Guinness record in 2020 with the sale of Kurt Cobain's guitar in his legendary 1993 'MTV Unplugged', six million dollars (5.6 million euros).\n\n\"It could even set a new world record and sell for more,\" exhorts Nolan. \"It's The Beatles, at a very important moment, John played it, George, who sadly are no longer with us, and Ringo recently played it too.\"\n\nThe quartet's drummer contacted Martin and his team upon learning of her reappearance, and played it during his reunion with her, he reveals to EFE.\n\n\"All of this influences its value, and that is what excites bidders,\" says the executive director of the auction that will take place in New York at the end of this month.\n\n\"Will it be a museum, an investor, a Beatles fan, or just a collector? We don't know, the auction will dictate,\" says Nolan. \"Maybe we will see it again on stage, in the hands of very famous bands in the very near future.\"", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thansan@usanews.net", "name": "Oliver Thansan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help!_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Help!

Even though it might be fun to just strum a bunch of chords and get by alright, being able to play so fast that no one else can understand what you're doing is the kind of god-level skill that usually makes someone's head inflate. Despite his talent, Joe Walsh still seemed like a loveable guy who was happy to be playing, but he admitted that he could play Beatles solos far better than George Harrison could.\n\nIf anyone was going to step to The Beatles and claim they did something better, they were going to be in for an uphill battle. The Fab Four have been categorised as the first and best at nearly everything that rock and roll is built on, so what makes the one guitar legend from the Eagles seem like a contender?\n\nWell, it's not like Walsh doesn't have chops. Compared to other guitar heroes like Eric Clapton, he can certainly hold his own, and the fact that he was able to jam with Jimi Hendrix and was praised by Pete Townshend of The Who has put him into rock and roll Valhalla for the rest of his life.\n\nWalsh always turned back to The Beatles for inspiration, though, and why not when they have such great guitar parts? John Lennon and George Harrison were always a great team behind their respective fretboards, but by the time they developed into a studio-only band, they were writing the kind of guitar solos that no one could have reproduced.\n\nWhereas most of Revolver centres on twisting the guitar into different shapes to suit whatever the song needs, good luck finding tabs for half of them. For example, most of the guitar lines from 'I'm Only Sleeping' were recorded in reverse, 'And Your Bird Can Sing' is the closest they came to a traditional rocker, featuring Harrison and Paul McCartney playing in harmony on two guitar tracks -- they enjoyed making things complicated.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to put two of those guitar tracks together and make them sound clean, but Walsh admitted that he may have beaten the band at their own game. When speaking with The Chicago Tribune, Walsh remembered Starr telling him that it was two guitars overlaid on top of each other, to which the guitar legend responded, \"[Ringo said], 'Nah, nah, nah -- he played it twice. It's two notes playing together!' I think I'm the only guy who can play it -- including George\".\n\nConsidering his history working in the Eagles, Walsh displacing Harrison on this song isn't exactly him speaking out of turn. For as much as he puts into his country-style licks, Walsh has learned the importance of playing dyads, which are two-note inversions of different chords in a melody.\n\nThose are commonplace in old country tunes, but getting those under his fingers means that Walsh could play both McCartney and Harrison's melodies at the same time. He might come and go from Starr's All Starr Band, depending on what he's up to, but if Starr did decide to break out this old Fab favourite live, Walsh could justifiably do the guitar orchestra all on his own.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_coffman@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Tim Coffman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Beatles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chord (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolver (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Townshend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Only_Sleeping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I'm Only Sleeping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fingerboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_solo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar solo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagles (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jam session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimi Hendrix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Your_Bird_Can_Sing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "And Your Bird Can Sing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lick_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lick (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul McCartney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ringo Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melody"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Entertainment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2023/12/Joe-Walsh-The-Eagles-Guitarist-Musician-Far-Out-Magazine-F.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540998", "eventUri": "eng-9540998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

One such guitar star was Queen's Brian May, who underscored Eddy's influence in a touching Instagram post.\n\nOne of the original guitar heroes, Eddy left an indelible mark on a generation of riffers in the late '50s and early '60s, thanks to hits like Rebel Rouser, and his take on the Peter Gunn theme.\n\nIn the post, May remembers meeting the guitarist in Nashville in 2017 - an encounter that saw Eddy pick up May's iconic Red Special guitar.\n\nCiting him as \"an inspiration and hero to me and my dad\" - the latter of whom famously helped his son build the Red Special guitar - May discussed how his \"revolutionary\" approach to the instrument breathed fresh, exciting life into what the humble electric guitar was capable of.\n\n\"Rebel Rouser was one of the very first solo rock guitar hits ever,\" says May. \"Duane's sound was distinctive, original, and completely cutting-edge.\n\n\"His style involved bending low strings of his guitar, an earthy, exciting innovation. The first note of the Rebel Rouser riff is a low F# on the bottom string of his guitar, hit, bent up to G, and back down again before the second note - the low E - is hit.\n\n\"It might sound like nothing out of the ordinary in these days of a million flashy electric guitar players, but at that time it was revolutionary - freeing the guitar from its former stiffness, and making it talk. For me and thousands of other kids at the time, it was joyous and inspiring. We all wanted that deep 'twang.'\n\nThe track, which Eddy co-wrote with Lee Hazlewood, was released in 1958, with Eddy's twangy guitar the dazzling centerpiece to the instrumental.\n\nIt was loosely inspired by an old folk song, Who's Gonna Shoe Your Pretty Little Feet, and tracked with a Gretsch 6120 played through a Magnatone amp.\n\n\"To me,\" May's post continues, \"it's thrilling that he played my homemade guitar, all those years later. Legend! So sad to lose you.\"\n\nMay also shared a series of pictures of himself and the change-making guitarist locked in an embrace. Taken backstage at a Queen show in 2017, May's admiration for Eddy is visibly etched across his face.\n\nHaving created Red Special replicas with esteemed luthier John Diggins - who died in January - and even released a Barbie-esque hot pink version last year, May is now working with Gibson.\n\nWhile there have been no grand reveals as to what that means for the future of the Red Special, the news has certainly kickstarted the rumor/speculation mill...", "source": {"uri": "guitarworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "guitarworld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel-'Rouser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebel-'Rouser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Eddy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duane Eddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gunn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Gunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ostinato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "String instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hazlewood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Hazlewood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretsch_6120", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretsch 6120"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luthier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luthier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Entertainment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMQe6EGjt9kyoES6mSXtMo-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540998", "eventUri": "eng-9540998", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 265, "textEnd": 273}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

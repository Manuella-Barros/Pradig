{"id": 243426692, "title": "'A Quiet Place: Day One' review: Moody prequel bests original", "text": "To watch \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d is to recalibrate your senses \u2014 not to the alien horror movie you know is in store but rather, to the intimate human drama it hangs onto, long after a lesser film would have given up. Among its lovely images, there's the distant New York skyline seen beyond a Queens cemetery, a sight familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever driven into town. There are the resigned glances of terminal patients in hospice. Mostly, we take in the exquisite face of Lupita Nyong\u2019o as Sam, a young person in the prime of life stricken with cancer, who carries the unfairness of her situation just below the surface. Sirens and fighter-jet shrieks ease their way into the sound mix, as they must in any prequel to 2018\u2019s civilization-ending \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d and 2020's more-of-the-same \"A Quiet Place Part II.\" But even as smoke and white ash fill the air (best to leave those Sept. 11 memories at home) and pissed-off creatures rampage like cattle down the city\u2019s glass and steel canyons, there\u2019s an unusual commitment to the darker fringes of postapocalyptic moviemaking. It\u2019s less \u201cFuriosa\u201d and more \u201cThe Road.\u201d Sam is already prepared to die, lending the film an impressively bleak tone and sparing us the rote machinations of hardy-band-of-survivors plotting. All she wants to do is walk \u2014 very quietly \u2014 approximately 120 blocks north from Chinatown to Harlem, where she can scarf the last slices of pizza from Patsy\u2019s before such delicacies become ancient history. It\u2019s a refreshing, near-radical concept to build a studio film around, and as Sam sets off, a tote bag on her arm and her black-and-white support cat Frodo beside her, you may be reminded of that other woman-and-feline survival story, \u201cAlien,\u201d stripped to the bone. (One also wonders, glumly, how NYC\u2019s thousands of dogs fared with these tetchy sound-averse invaders.) The person pulling all this off is director-screenwriter Michael Sarnoski, last seen evincing a recognizably human performance from Nicolas Cage as a crumpled, broken chef in \u201cPig,\u201d which was also about facing a kind of personal catastrophe. (He\u2019s now made two of the most downbeat foodie films in a row.) Sarnoski, who wrote the story with original creator John Krasinski, does fine enough by the James Cameron-like action sequences that probably were mandated by the powers that be: chase sequences in flooded subway tunnels \u2014 yuck \u2014 and abandoned landmarks. But he\u2019s stronger on personal moments, such as the finest take of Djimon Hounsou\u2019s career, consumed in spiraling guilt and choking back a scream after accidentally killing someone for panicking too loud. There\u2019s also a business-suited Brit (Joseph Quinn, last seen shredding to Metallica in \u201cStranger Things\u201d) who only wants to join Sam on her pizza quest. With a minimum of words, we somehow understand that he\u2019s devoted way too much of his time on the planet to not connecting with other human beings, and he may only get this one day to make up for it. You can take or leave a subplot about Sam\u2019s writing career and thwarted dreams. For this viewer, there's more poetry in her stopping at an abandoned bookstore, as we all would do, picking up a used paperback (fittingly, Octavia E. Butler\u2019s 1987 sci-fi novel \u201cDawn,\u201d which you sense she has read) and sniffing the pages: a history captured in a scent. She too is savoring humanity\u2019s last vestiges. This is a film that seems to know a lot about future psychology. May we never know such mournfulness outside of an ambitious summer blockbuster.", "summary": "Confidently directed by Michael Sarnoski (\"Pig\"), the movie assembles an unusually strong cast for postapocalyptic sci-fi, led by Oscar winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o.", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-06-28/a-quiet-place-day-one-review-lupita-nyongo-joseph-quinn-postapocalyptic", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b965ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F80%2F240a3b3444d792b0a76d6fc2f9da%2Faqpd1-11666rc-0.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:47:30", "author": "Joshua Rothkopf", "authors": ["Joshua Rothkopf"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.09}

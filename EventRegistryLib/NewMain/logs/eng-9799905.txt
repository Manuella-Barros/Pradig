But if he doesn't, BetMGM will deposit five $20 bonus bets into your account.\n\nThere are no odds restrictions on any bonus bets that result from the BetMGM bonus code SBWIRE offer, so place them as you choose. But they need to be used within seven days of being placed in your account or they will expire.\n\nBetMGM Bonus Code - Wager on Olympic Soccer, Men's Track, MLB & More\n\nUse the BetMGM bonus code SBWIRE to bet on today's women's soccer semifinal as Team USA is a -105 favorite against Germany. Noah Lyles, the gold medal winner in the 100m, goes for double gold in the finals of the 200m on Thursday as a -650 favorite with USA teammate Kenny Bednarek at +600.\n\nThere are some good MLB matchups tonight, too. Milwaukee starts Colin Rea (9-3, 3.59 ERA) in Atlanta against Chris Sale (13-3, 2.71) while the Red Sox send Brayan Bello (10-5, 5.13 ERA) to the mound in Kansas City against Seth Lugo (13-5, 2.57 ERA). You can use the BetMGM bonus code SBWIRE to bet on baseball and get a first-bet offer with one of the top sportsbook promos around.\n\nSign up with the King of Sportsbook and get this welcome offer. Claim the BetMGM bonus code SBWIRE and get a second chance if your first bet returns as a loss as BetMGM will return a bonus bet back to you equal to your first bet, up to the maximum of $1,500.",

The promo works the exact same, the key difference is that D.C. bettors earn $200 instead of $150 from the initial wager.\n\nYou'll have the choice between two promos in almost all BetMGM sports betting states.\n\nBetMGM bonus code SHNEWS1600\n\nFirst, this bonus code unlocks a 20% deposit match up to a maximum $1,600 in sports bonus with an $8,000 deposit. As long as you deposit at least $10, it's entirely up to you on how much to deposit.\n\nAfter earning the sports bonus, you'll need to cash bet 10x the bonus earned in the first 30 days of the new account. Once you meet that requirement, any cash winnings in your account are free to withdraw or use however you wish.\n\nYou'll also need to use the sports bonus within seven days to fund bets within BetMGM. If you profit cash from your sports bonus wagers, it can't be accessed until you meet that 10x cash betting requirement.\n\nBetMGM bonus code HANDLETOP\n\nAlternatively, you can apply this bonus code to access a first bet insurance, worth up to $1,500. You'll need at least a $10 deposit and cash bet of any size on anything to qualify.\n\nIf you win your first bet, the promo is essentially over since you don't access any bonus bets. If your bet misses, BetMGM matches whatever the stake loss was with bonus bets.\n\n$50 bet or less -- BetMGM sends you a single bonus bet to use within the platform\n\n$51 or higher -- You'll receive five bonus bets each worth 20% of your stake. If I lose a $100 bet, I would receive five $20 bonus bets.\n\nYou'll have seven days to play the bonus bets once for potential cash from a winning bonus bet wager.\n\nbet365 is another book on our list with a choice between two offers in 10 states and an enhanced promo in Pennsylvania, bet365's newest state.\n\n$1,000 First Bet Safety Net\n\nThe safety net is another first bet insurance, worth up to $1,000. If you select this promo, you'll need at least a $10 deposit and a cash bet of any size on anything.\n\nJust like any other first bet insurance on this list, the outcome of the bet determines how the promo plays out:\n\nWin -- You profit cash and keep the stake\n\nMiss -- bet365 reimburses your stake with bonus bets up to a maximum $1,000\n\nbet365, with either promo, deposits bonus bets to your account within an hour of the bet settlement. These are funds to use within the platform and are valid for seven days to fund a bet for potential cash.\n\nBet $5, Get $150\n\nAlternatively, you can make at least a $10 deposit and place $5 or more on -500 odds or longer. This promo differs because no matter how the bet plays out, you earn the bonus bets.\n\nThe bonus bets typically deposit within an hour of bet settlement and are valid for seven days. bet365's bonus bets can be split across bets so you could make 10 $15 bets or place all $150 in bonus bets on one wager.\n\nBet $5, Get $150 + 50 casino spins (PA)\n\nThe Pennsylvania launch promo is nearly identical to the bet/get mentioned with one addition. You'll also receive 50 casino spins to use on bet365's online casino to play online slots for a chance at real cash.\n\nbet365's online casino is currently available in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nESPN BET offers another first bet insurance, which you'll notice are quite common among the top sports betting sites.\n\nYou'll need to manually apply the promo code when setting up a new account in 18 available states. Next, make at least a $10 deposit and a cash bet of any size to qualify.\n\nThe mechanics of the promo are the same: A win is treated like a normal winning bet while a loss is recouped by bonus bets.\n\nIf your first bet doesn't go your way, ESPN BET always sends five payments of bonus bets that are valid for seven days before expiration.\n\nThis is a unique bet match offer, where each day you'll place a daily bet and earn a match in bonus bets up to a maximum $100 each day. Here's what you'll need for the promo:\n\nNo matter how the bet settles, the wager alone earns bonus bets on that particular day. The bonus bets hit your account within 72 hours and last for seven days from receipt.\n\nGet up to $1,500 in bonus bets over your first 11 days - KY, KY, NC, TN\n\nIn four Fanatics states, you'll find a slight variation of the $1K promo mentioned above. It includes a $500 bonus bet match available on the first day followed by 10 days where you can earn up to a $100 bonus bet match each day.\n\nThe same rules apply where each day you'll need to opt in to the promo before betting. Then, you can place a bet of any size on -200 or greater odds.\n\nWe round out the list with Caesars Sportsbook which provides another $1,000 first bet on the house. There are a few key differences from the other first bet insurances on this list.\n\nFirst, there is a larger betting requirement in that you'll need at least a $10 deposit and wager to qualify. Next, if your bet misses, the bonus bets are paid out a bit differently.\n\nThe bonus bets are always paid out in one single bonus bet. For example, if I wager $500 and it misses, I'll have a singular $500 bonus bet that must be used on one single straight bet or parlay.", "source": {"uri": "sportshandle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SportsHandle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_ilenstine@sportshandle.com", "name": "Chris Ilenstine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet365", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bet365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_casino", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caesars Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://sportshandle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164644863-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799905", "eventUri": "eng-9799905", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Before you wager on one of the Tour's longest-running tournaments, make sure to check out the lucrative Wyndham Championship betting promos created just for new bettors.\n\nThis $7.9 million tournament at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina, has attracted a strong field because it's the last chance to earn FedEx Cup points and climb the standings into the Top 70.

It's the biggest betting limit you're going to find among all sportsbook promo codes.\n\nHere's how it works: BetMGM has your back on your first bet when you bet anywhere from $5 to $1,500. If that first bet wins, then you're rich and happy and never needed protection. But if your first bet loses, you're still good because BetMGM will return the full amount of your first bet to you as bonus bets.\n\nYou'll receive five bonus bets -- each worth 20 percent of your original wager -- if your first bet was for $50 or more. You'll receive one bonus bet -- matching your original wager -- If your first bet was for less than $50.\n\nYou can't withdraw your bonus bets with the BetMGM bonus code SBWIRE, or for that matter, with any of the other Wyndham Championship betting promos mentioned in this story. However, BetMGM and all other golf betting sites listed here abide by a 1X playthrough requirement. This means any bonus bet needs to win just once for you to collect the profit in cash.\n\nBest Wyndham Championship Betting Promos: Caesars Sportsbook Promo Code SBWIRE1000\n\nWhen you set up a Caesars Sportsbook account with the Caesars Sportsbook promo code SBWIRE1000, you're rewarded with a first bet up to $1,000 on Caesars.\n\nThe phrase \"on Caesars\" is Caesars Sportsbook's way of letting you know they're protecting your first bet when it's anywhere in the $10 to $1,000 range. If that first bet happens to lose, then Caesars Sportsbook sends back the full amount of your bet as one bet credit. In golfing parlance, it's a mulligan.\n\nYou'll have 14 days to play your bet credit. Download the Caesars Sportsbook app -- one of the most comprehensive sports betting apps in the marketplace -- to find bets or specials with the best odds.\n\nBest Wyndham Championship Betting Promos: Fanatics Sportsbook Promo\n\nCoaches prize consistency. Athletes prize consistency. Fanatics Sportsbook rewards consistent bettors. When you launch an account with the Fanatics Sportsbook promo, you can earn as much as $1,000 in bonus bets in a 10-day span.\n\nThis offer begins with Day 1, which is the day you place your first bet. If it's anywhere from $5 to $100, then Fanatics Sportsbook rewards you with a bonus bet for the same amount. Then you have the same opportunity on each of the next nine calendar days. Hence, if you place a $100 first bet each of these 10 days, you'll have $1,000 in bonus bets PLUS whatever you win on your original bets.\n\nBettors in Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio and Tennessee can enjoy an even better deal -- up to $1,500 in bonus bets over 11 days. The new Day 1 opportunity is a 100% match of a bet up to $500.\n\nEach bonus bet arrives in your account within 72 hours. Once it gets there, you have seven days to play it on any sport you like.\n\nBest Wyndham Championship Betting Promos: bet365 Bonus Code SBKWIRE\n\nDoes bet365's welcome offer feature bonus bets or a protected first bet? The answer is ... yes! When you register for a bet365 account with the bet365 bonus code SBKWIRE, you get to choose your preferred welcome offer: Either $150 in bonus bets or a First Bet Safety Net up to $1,000.\n\nIf you select the bonus bets, place a $5 first bet on the Wyndham Championship or any other event. The moment you do, bet365 delivers $150 in bonus bets to your account. If you select the First Bet Safety Net, then bet365 has your back on your first bet all the way up to $1,000. If your first bet doesn't win, bet365 returns your full bet in the form of bonus bets.\n\nBest Wyndham Championship Betting Promos: DraftKings Promo Code\n\nIf you want to keep it simple, keep it locked on the DraftKings promo code. When you start an account with this code, you secure a Bet $5, Get $150 welcome offer.\n\nIt's just this basic. Place a $5 bet on the Wyndham Championship, a Major League Baseball game, an Olympics event or anything else on the DraftKings site. The moment you make this move, DraftKings wings six $25 bonus bets into your account.\n\nYou'll have seven days to play these bets.\n\nBest Wyndham Championship Betting Promos: FanDuel Promo Code\n\nLast but not least in our list of the best Wyndham Championship betting promos is the FanDuel welcome offer. When you create a FanDuel account with the FanDuel promo code, you'll claim $150 in bonus bets if you win a $5 first bet.\n\nClearly, it's important to win the $5 first bet, so we encourage you to look for the biggest favorites and bet them to win on the moneyline. For example, before Team USA prepared to play Brazil in the men's basketball quarterfinals Tuesday, they were -15,000 to win on the moneyline. So, take a look at Team USA's odds in Thursday's semifinal first.\n\nIf/when you win your $5 first bet, then the $150 in bonus bets will hit your account within 72 hours. FanDuel offers a sweet wrinkle to this: You can split that $150 into as many bonus bets you want to play. If you're down to make 150 $1 bets, that's cool with FanDuel.\n\nInside the Tournament: Best 2024 Wyndham Championship Betting Promos & Bonuses, Odds\n\nThere's plenty of opportunity for players outside the Top 70 to move up in the FedEx Cup standings this week at the Wyndham Championship. If you recall last year's tournament, Lucas Glover began the week in 112nd place in the standings. But by winning, he jumped all the way to 49th.\n\nThis helps to explain Jordan Spieth's late commitment to this tournament. Spieth stands 63rd in the FedEx Cup standings with 782 points -- placing him 114 points ahead of 70th-place Brendon Todd.\n\nGlover needs to make another jump this week, though not one quite as dramatic. He enters Thursday's opening round in 76th place.\n\nSungjae Im is the pre-tournament favorite at +1400 at BetMGM. He's followed by Billy Horschel, Shane Lowry and Si Woo Kim, who each entered the week at +2500.\n\nYou can bet on any of those players or any other in this week's field after signing up with the best Wyndham Championship betting promos to score thousands of dollars in bonus bets and first-bet insurance plans.", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"},

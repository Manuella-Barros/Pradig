Harper smashed a grand slam the next night against Toronto.\n\n\"As a team, any given night, everyone's going to do their job,\" Harper said. \"We're not really worried about our numbers as individuals. We're just going out there trying to win the games we need to. No matter who comes through at the right time or who comes through each night.\"\n\nWant consistent hitting?

We have a good group of people that can do that. Stubbs, Marsh, they tend to bring that every day.\"\n\nSome of the super stats tell the story.\n\nThe Phillies are 26-12 and their .684 winning percentage was tops in baseball entering Thursday's games.\n\nThey won 11 straight home games before Wednesday's loss to Toronto, one shy of matching the Citizens Bank Park record. They have won 11 of 13 games overall and 26 of their last 36. Harper has hit three times this season with the bases loaded -- and has two grand slams. They are 22-1 when leading after six innings and 23-0 when leading after the eighth.\n\nPhiladelphia's biggest accomplishment, though, just might be this: They are leading -- yes, leading -- the NL East by two games over the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe Phillies ended each of the last two seasons among baseball's best. Led by a homer-happy, bat-spiking offense, the Phillies lost the 2022 World Series in six games to the Houston Astros. Last season, the Phillies took a 3-2 series lead into Game 6 of the NL Championship Series before losing the final two games at home to the Arizona Diamondbacks and bowed out.\n\nWhat's not forgotten in Philly is the long climb it took for the Phillies to reach October.\n\nThey were 25-30 at the end of last May. The Phillies opened 2022 at 22-29 when they fired manager Joe Girardi and promoted Thomson. Slow starts and sizzling Junes -- 18-8 last year; 19-8 in 2022 -- had become the norm for the Phillies.\n\nThis year's team does have unfinished business in the postseason. The first World Series championship since 2008 remains the ultimate goal. But a great wire-to-wire regular season and even the division title that has eluded them is on the table this year.\n\nAnchored by Wheeler and Su\u00e1rez, the Phillies boast the best rotation in baseball. One hiccup is two-time All-Star shortstop Trea Turner will miss at least six weeks with a strained left hamstring. Turner had started all 30 games this season and was hitting .343 with two homers, 10 doubles, nine RBIs and 10 stolen bases. Without him, the Phillies are still 4-1.\n\n\"I think what happened the last two years at the end is really motivating for this group,\" Thomson said. \"It's not just Bryce that's competitive. I think the entire room is competitive. They feed off of each other that way. These guys, they come to play every day. They are tough. And they have fun at the same time. It's just a really good group, a special group.\"\n\nOn the stat sheet, the Phillies are better than those '22 and '23 teams.\n\nThat won't matter much come October. But if Harper again goes on a late-season tear and Wheeler keeps shutting teams down, the Phillies are primed to make another World Series run.\n\nWell, they can just as long as they remember to stay

But sexy, too?\n\nWell, no team has been quite as alluring to the packed crowds at Citizens Bank Park as the Phillies. Just ask them.\n\nBrandon Marsh, the outfielder with the Rip Van Winkle whiskers, was mic'd up for an ESPN Sunday night game when he was relayed a fan question from social media by the broadcast booth: If you had to start a rock band, who would you take from the team and what's the band name?\n\nMarsh rattled off catcher Garrett Stubbs, slugger Kyle Schwarber and outfielder Cristian Pache as his fellow band members, then as he hustled off the field after making a catch, blurted out the name that has since launched a blossoming business of the catchphrase T-shirts.\n\n\"Stay Loose and Sexy, baby,\" Marsh said.\n\nMarsh said he has his own band shirt -- which he has yet to reveal -- and the Phillies have reveled this week in the attention the fictional name has stirred.\n\nStubbs -- the backup catcher/clubhouse DJ/ Bud box hat fashionista -- wants in as guitarist and backup singer. Of note, he does not play guitar or sing much more than on team karaoke nights.\n\n\"Pretty electric from Marshy,\" Stubbs said.\n\nTaking center stage as an MLB headline act, the Phillies are about as plugged in to playing good baseball as a team can be these days. Just take a look at their greatest hits -- such as Harper's three-run homer in a Monday win over San Francisco. For an encore? Harper smashed a grand slam the next night against Toronto.\n\n\"As a team, any given night, everyone's going to do their job,\" Harper said. \"We're not really worried about our numbers as individuals. We're just going out there trying to win the games we need to. No matter who comes through at the right time or who comes through each night.\"\n\nWant consistent hitting? Third baseman Alec Bohm this week just wrapped up an 18-game hitting streak. Perfect pitching? Ranger Su\u00e1rez -- with a 6-0 record and 1.77 ERA -- takes the mound Friday for the start of a three-game series in Miami.\n\n\"There won't be many people, probably, at the ballpark,\" manager Rob Thomson said. \"You've got to internally create your own energy. We have a good group of people that can do that. Stubbs, Marsh, they tend to bring that every day.\"\n\nSome of the super stats tell the story.\n\nThe Phillies are 26-12 and their .684 winning percentage was tops in baseball entering Thursday's games.\n\nThey won 11 straight home games before Wednesday's loss to Toronto, one shy of matching the Citizens Bank Park record. They have won 11 of 13 games overall and 26 of their last 36. Harper has hit three times this season with the bases loaded -- and has two grand slams. They are 22-1 when leading after six innings and 23-0 when leading after the eighth.\n\nPhiladelphia's biggest accomplishment, though, just might be this: They are leading -- yes, leading -- the NL East by two games over the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe Phillies ended each of the last two seasons among baseball's best. Led by a homer-happy, bat-spiking offense, the Phillies lost the 2022 World Series in six games to the Houston Astros. Last season, the Phillies took a 3-2 series lead into Game 6 of the NL Championship Series before losing the final two games at home to the Arizona Diamondbacks and bowed out.\n\nWhat's not forgotten in Philly is the long climb it took for the Phillies to reach October.\n\nThey were 25-30 at the end of last May. The Phillies opened 2022 at 22-29 when they fired manager Joe Girardi and promoted Thomson. Slow starts and sizzling Junes -- 18-8 last year; 19-8 in 2022 -- had become the norm for the Phillies.\n\nThis year's team does have unfinished business in the postseason. The first World Series championship since 2008 remains the ultimate goal. But a great wire-to-wire regular season and even the division title that has eluded them is on the table this year.\n\nAnchored by Wheeler and Su\u00e1rez, the Phillies boast the best rotation in baseball. One hiccup is two-time All-Star shortstop Trea Turner will miss at least six weeks with a strained left hamstring. Turner had started all 30 games this season and was hitting .343 with two homers, 10 doubles, nine RBIs and 10 stolen bases. Without him, the Phillies are still 4-1.\n\n\"I think what happened the last two years at the end is really motivating for this group,\" Thomson said. \"It's not just Bryce that's competitive. I think the entire room is competitive. They feed off of each other that way. These guys, they come to play every day. They are tough. And they have fun at the same time. It's just a really good group, a special group.\"\n\nOn the stat sheet, the Phillies are better than those '22 and '23 teams.\n\nThat won't matter much come October. But if Harper again goes on a late-season tear and Wheeler keeps shutting teams down, the Phillies are primed to make another World Series run.\n\nWell, they can just as long as they remember to stay loose and sexy, baby.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person",

But sexy, too?\n\nWell, no team has been quite as alluring to the packed crowds at Citizens Bank Park as the Phillies. Just ask them.\n\nBrandon Marsh, the outfielder with the Rip Van Winkle whiskers, was mic\u00b4d up for an ESPN Sunday night game when he was relayed a fan question from social media by the broadcast booth: If you had to start a rock band, who would you take from the team and what\u00b4s the band name?\n\nMarsh rattled off catcher Garrett Stubbs, slugger Kyle Schwarber and outfielder Cristian Pache as his fellow band members, then as he hustled off the field after making a catch, blurted out the name that has since launched a blossoming business of the catchphrase T-shirts.\n\n\"Stay Loose and Sexy, baby,\" Marsh said.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies' Bryce Harper, center, celebrates with Bryson Stott, left, and Brandon Marsh after the Phillies won a baseball game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nMarsh said he has his own band shirt - which he has yet to reveal - and the Phillies have reveled this week in the attention the fictional name has stirred.\n\nStubbs - the backup catcher/clubhouse DJ/ Bud box hat fashionista - wants in as guitarist and backup singer. Of note, he does not play guitar or sing much more than on team karaoke nights.\n\n\"Pretty electric from Marshy,\" Stubbs said.\n\nTaking center stage as an MLB headline act, the Phillies are about as plugged in to playing good baseball as a team can be these days. Just take a look at their greatest hits - such as Harper\u00b4s three-run homer in a Monday win over San Francisco. For an encore? Harper smashed a grand slam the next night against Toronto.\n\n\"As a team, any given night, everyone\u00b4s going to do their job,\" Harper said. \"We\u00b4re not really worried about our numbers as individuals. We\u00b4re just going out there trying to win the games we need to. No matter who comes through at the right time or who comes through each night.\"\n\nWant consistent hitting? Third baseman Alec Bohm this week just wrapped up an 18-game hitting streak. Perfect pitching? Ranger Su\u00e1rez - with a 6-0 record and 1.77 ERA - takes the mound Friday for the start of a three-game series in Miami.\n\n\"There won't be many people, probably, at the ballpark,\" manager Rob Thomson said. \"You've got to internally create your own energy. We have a good group of people that can do that. Stubbs, Marsh, they tend to bring that every day.\"\n\nSome of the super stats tell the story.\n\nThe Phillies are 26-12 and their .684 winning percentage was tops in baseball entering Thursday\u00b4s games.\n\nThey won 11 straight home games before Wednesday\u00b4s loss to Toronto, one shy of matching the Citizens Bank Park record. They have won 11 of 13 games overall and 26 of their last 36. Harper has hit three times this season with the bases loaded - and has two grand slams. They are 22-1 when leading after six innings and 23-0 when leading after the eighth.\n\nPhiladelphia's biggest accomplishment, though, just might be this: They are leading - yes, leading - the NL East by two games over the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe Phillies ended each of the last two seasons among baseball's best. Led by a homer-happy, bat-spiking offense, the Phillies lost the 2022 World Series in six games to the Houston Astros. Last season, the Phillies took a 3-2 series lead into Game 6 of the NL Championship Series before losing the final two games at home to the Arizona Diamondbacks and bowed out.\n\nWhat's not forgotten in Philly is the long climb it took for the Phillies to reach October.\n\nThey were 25-30 at the end of last May. The Phillies opened 2022 at 22-29 when they fired manager Joe Girardi and promoted Thomson. Slow starts and sizzling Junes - 18-8 last year; 19-8 in 2022 - had become the norm for the Phillies.\n\nThis year's team does have unfinished business in the postseason. The first World Series championship since 2008 remains the ultimate goal. But a great wire-to-wire regular season and even the division title that has eluded them is on the table this year.\n\nAnchored by Wheeler and Su\u00e1rez, the Phillies boast the best rotation in baseball. One hiccup is two-time All-Star shortstop Trea Turner will miss at least six weeks with a strained left hamstring. Turner had started all 30 games this season and was hitting .343 with two homers, 10 doubles, nine RBIs and 10 stolen bases. Without him, the Phillies are still 4-1.\n\n\"I think what happened the last two years at the end is really motivating for this group,\" Thomson said. \"It's not just Bryce that's competitive. I think the entire room is competitive. They feed off of each other that way. These guys, they come to play every day. They are tough. And they have fun at the same time. It's just a really good group, a special group.\"\n\nOn the stat sheet, the Phillies are better than those \u00b422 and \u00b423 teams.\n\nThat won't matter much come October. But if Harper again goes on a late-season tear and Wheeler keeps shutting teams down, the Phillies are primed to make another World Series run.\n\nWell, they can just as long as they remember to stay loose and sexy, baby.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies' Brandon Marsh, right, celebrates with J.T.

How will they handle being frontrunners?", "body": "Philadelphia Phillies | The Phillies are off to their best start since 1993. How will they handle being frontrunners?\n\nA few nights ago, as J.T. Realmuto discussed another resounding Phillies victory, someone asked if he's afraid that they may be peaking in May.\n\n\"No,\" the catcher said, smirking. \"This team's built for the long haul.\"\n\nThe entire exchange dripped with irony. The Phillies were 21-29 in 2022 and 25-32 last year before finally hearing the alarm clock, scrambling to pull themselves together, and making the playoffs as a wild card. Entering this season, then, all of the focus was on being awake from the start.\n\nSo, here are the Phillies, 26-12 early birds, with the best record in the majors and the third-best through 38 games in their 142-season history, and all anyone seems to be thinking about is ... can they keep it up?\n\nThe past informs us that a 110-win pace usually is unsustainable. The schedule will toughen. Challenges will arise. The Phillies haven't lost back-to-back games since April 23-24, or three in a row all season. At some point, they will experience a downturn.\n\nBut they did get to Game 6 of the World Series in 2022 and Game 7 of the NL Championship Series last year. Even though most projection systems (hello, PECOTA and FanGraphs) put the Phillies well behind the Braves and Dodgers, this rapid success isn't out of the blue. There are three powerhouses in the National League, not just two.\n\nMaybe the question, then, isn't whether the Phillies zoomed too quickly to the pole position. It's how they will handle driving the pace car rather than having to floor it in June and July just to get back in the wild-card race.\n\nWithout sounding overconfident, manager Rob Thomson believes that any concern over the Phillies being complacent is misguided. Indeed, in actions and words, the players appear to be fueled by the unfinished business of back-to-back October runs that ended in disappointments.\n\nIt starts with the biggest star on the roster. Bryce Harper banged two three-run homers and a grand slam in a three-game span this week despite getting maybe one pitch to hit per game. But he was so angry after grounding out with a runner on second in the eighth inning of a 5-3 loss to the Blue Jays on Wednesday that he cleared the top step of the dugout with a two-handed fling of his bat.\n\n\"It's not just Bryce that's competitive,\" Thomson said Wednesday, before the Phillies snapped an 11-game home winning streak and an overall seven-game roll. \"I think the entire room is competitive, and they feed off of each other that way. What happened in the last two years at the end is really motivating for this group.\"\n\nSaid Kyle Schwarber: \"Everyone's disappointed after a loss. It doesn't matter if we're 10 games above .500 or 10 games below .500, a loss is a loss.\"\n\nBut the last two Phillies teams found their identity in their lousy starts. In 2022, it took 160 games to end a decadelong playoff drought; last year, they clinched in Game 157. Both times, they finished 14 games behind the Braves.\n\nEverything was more difficult than necessary. They wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nBy comparison, the Phillies vaulted into first place last Friday night, 33 games into the season. It marked the first time since April 2, 2023, that the Braves didn't lead the NL East. The Phillies were unsurprised, but it remains an unfamiliar feeling.\n\nHow will the Phillies handle frontrunning? If they keep piling up wins -- and 19 of the next 22 games are against the Marlins (10-29), Mets (18-18), Nationals (18-18), Rockies (8-28), Giants (17-21), and Cardinals (15-21) -- will they consider throttling pitchers' workloads or building in extra time off for lineup regulars?\n\nThomson second-guessed his use of Trea Turner, who started the first 33 games and played all but nine innings at shortstop before straining his left hamstring while scoring from second base on a wild pitch last Friday night. He's expected to miss at least six weeks.\n\n\"He was on base so much. It takes its toll on your legs,\" Thomson said. \"It's tough to gauge. He's a guy that plays 160 games a year typically. I don't think he was overplayed, but if he was, that's my fault. I'll wear that.\n\n\"We have to make sure we keep people healthy. We can't push it so hard that we're putting people in jeopardy. So we have to be smart about that.\"\n\nEspecially because the most impressive thing about the Phillies' blazing start has been their ability to tap into organizational depth.\n\nTo wit: Spencer Turnbull posted a 1.67 ERA in six starts in place of Taijuan Walker. Kody Clemens is 4-for-8 with a double, triple, and two homers in two fill-in starts. The Phillies have two shortstop alternatives: Edmundo Sosa or second baseman Bryson Stott, with Whit Merrifield at second. Either way, they are 4-1 since Turner went down.\n\nIt's the biggest difference in the Phillies from three seasons ago, when Harper was crowned NL MVP, Wheeler was the Cy Young runner-up, and a star-laden, top-heavy roster finished 82-80 and out of the playoffs.\n\nAnd if the Phillies are able to stay at the front of the pack now, the strength of the back half of the roster will be the biggest reason why.\n\n\"If you look at a lot of really good teams in the league, they have depth,\" Harper said. \"If that's starting pitching depth, or if that's infield or hitting, or anything, a lot of really good teams have that. I think [president of baseball operations Dave] Dombrowski's done a great job of rounding out our roster and making sure that we have those pieces that can come up at any point and help us win.\"\n\nAnd so the Phillies arrived in Miami on the wings of their best start since 1993, when they were 27-11 through 38 games and wound up winning the pennant. The only time they started better than that was 1976, when they were 28-10 en route to a division crown.\n\nThose teams led pretty much wire to wire. How will this group, forever chasing the Braves, handle being chased?\n\n\"[The mentality] shouldn't change,\" Thomson said. \"We've got a good club. Just keep grinding, keep playing, keep being yourselves.

Realmuto discussed another resounding Phillies victory, someone asked if he's afraid that they may be peaking in May.\n\n\"No,\" the catcher said, smirking. \"This team's built for the long haul.\"\n\nThe entire exchange dripped with irony. The Phillies were 21-29 in 2022 and 25-32 last year before finally hearing the alarm clock, scrambling to recover, and making the playoffs as a wild card. Entering this season, then, all of the focus was on being awake from the start.\n\n\" READ MORE: Is the Phillies' dominant starting pitching sustainable all season? Their catcher thinks so.\n\nSo, here are the Phillies, 26-12 early birds, with the best record in the majors and the third-best through 38 games in their 142-season history, and all anyone seems to be thinking about is ... can they keep it up?\n\nThe past informs us that a 110-win pace is usually unsustainable. The schedule will toughen. Challenges will arise. The Phillies haven't lost back-to-back games since April 23-24, or three in a row all season. At some point, they will experience a downturn.\n\nBut the Phillies did get to Game 6 of the World Series in 2022 and Game 7 of the NL Championship Series last year. Even though most projection systems (hello, PECOTA and Fangraphs) put them well behind the Braves and Dodgers, this rapid success isn't out of the blue. There are three powerhouses in the National League, not just two.\n\nMaybe the question, then, isn't whether the Phillies zoomed too quickly to the pole position. It's how they will handle driving the pace car rather than having to floor it in June and July just to get back in the wild-card race.\n\nWithout sounding overconfident, manager Rob Thomson believes that any concern over the Phillies being complacent is misguided. Indeed, in actions and words, the players appear to be fueled by the unfinished business of back-to-back October runs that ended in disappointments.\n\nIt starts with the biggest star on the roster. Bryce Harper banged two three-run homers and a grand slam in a three-game span this week despite getting maybe one pitch to hit per game. But he was so angry after grounding out with a runner on second in the eighth inning of a 5-3 loss to the Blue Jays Wednesday that he cleared the top step of the dugout with a two-handed fling of his bat.\n\n\"It's not just Bryce that's competitive,\" Thomson said Wednesday, before the Phillies snapped an 11-game home winning streak and an overall seven-game roll. \"I think the entire room is competitive, and they feed off of each other that way. What happened in the last two years at the end is really motivating for this group.\"\n\nSaid Kyle Schwarber: \"Everyone's disappointed after a loss. It doesn't matter if we're 10 games above .500 or 10 games below .500, a loss is a loss.\"\n\nBut the last two Phillies teams found their identity in their lousy starts. In 2022, it took 160 games to end a decadelong playoff drought; last year, they clinched in Game 157. Both times, they finished 14 games behind the Braves.\n\nEverything was more difficult than necessary. They wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n\" READ MORE: Phillies vs. Braves: Who's chasing whom? The subplots that make up baseball's best rivalry.\n\nBy comparison, the Phillies vaulted into first place last Friday night, 33 games into the season. It marked the first time since April 2, 2023 that the Braves didn't lead the NL East. The Phillies were unsurprised, but it remains an unfamiliar feeling.\n\nHow will the Phillies handle frontrunning? If they keep piling up wins -- and 19 of the next 22 games are against the Marlins (10-29), Mets (18-18), Nationals (18-18), Rockies (8-28), Giants (17-21), and Cardinals (15-21) -- will they consider throttling back pitchers' workloads or building in extra time off for lineup regulars?\n\nThomson second-guessed his use of Trea Turner, who started the first 33 games and played all but nine innings at shortstop before straining his left hamstring while scoring from second base on a wild pitch last Friday night. He's expected to miss at least six weeks.\n\n\"He was on base so much, it takes its toll on your legs,\" Thomson said. \"It's tough to gauge. He's a guy that plays 160 games a year typically. I don't think he was overplayed, but if he was, that's my fault. I'll wear that.\n\n\"We have to make sure we keep people healthy. We can't push it so hard that we're putting people in jeopardy. So, we have to be smart about that.\"\n\nEspecially because the most impressive thing about the Phillies' blazing start has been their ability to tap into organizational depth.\n\nTo wit: Spencer Turnbull posted a 1.67 ERA in six starts in place of Taijuan Walker. Kody Clemens is 4-for-8 with a double, triple, and two homers in two fill-in starts. The Phillies have two shortstop alternatives: Edmundo Sosa or second baseman Bryson Stott, with Whit Merrifield at second. Either way, they are 4-1 since Turner went down.\n\n\" READ MORE: Inside baseball's arms crisis: What can be done to curb the game's spate of pitching injuries?\n\nIt's the biggest difference in the Phillies from three seasons ago, when Harper was crowned NL MVP, Wheeler was the Cy Young runner-up, and a star-laden, top-heavy roster finished 82-80 and out of the playoffs.\n\nAnd if the Phillies are able to stay at the front of the pack now, the strength of the back half of the roster will be the biggest reason why.\n\n\"If you look at a lot of really good teams in the league, they have depth,\" Harper said. \"If that's starting pitching depth, or if that's infield or hitting, or anything, a lot of really good teams have that. I think [president of baseball operations Dave] Dombrowski's done a great job of rounding out our roster and making sure that we have those pieces that can come up at any point and help us win.\"\n\nAnd so, the Phillies arrived in Miami on the wings of their best start since 1993, when they were 27-11 through 38 games and wound up winning the pennant. The only time they started better than that was 1976, when they were 28-10 en route to a division crown.\n\nThose teams led pretty much wire to wire. How will this group, forever chasing the Braves, handle being chased?\n\n\"[The mentality] shouldn't change,\" Thomson said. \"We've got a good club. Just keep grinding, keep playing, keep being yourselves.

There were 76 of them.\n\nNow after the schedules have been made more equal -- with each MLB team playing every other team in two series per season -- there are 54 of them.\n\nThe Phillies are 3-3 so far against the NL East, dropping two of three to start the year against the Braves and winning two of three against the Nationals. They're about to play 10 in a row.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons the Phillies were unable to really put up a fight in the NL East last season is that they struggled against their division rivals. Last year they finished below .500 against the division and as a result, had to make the postseason as a Wildcard team.\n\nThe Braves won the division by 14 games in 2023. It was their sixth crown in a row.\n\nCurrently the Phillies lead is two games. It's the longest they've held a lead in the NL East in years.\n\nThe major difference at this point of the season for the current squad is their level of play. Last year on May 9, the Phillies were 17-19. As they head into a three-game series in Miami Friday, they are 26-12.\n\nInterestingly, according a baseball reference projection, the Braves are still more likely to win the division. This, despite the fact that the Phillies have more wins right now, and the 12th toughest schedule to left play (they have had the second easiest so far) while the Braves have the seventh toughest schedule remaining (after playing the 19th toughest thus far).\n\nThe NL East as a whole is also potentially a weaker division right now. Last season the other four teams combined for a .515 percentage, with three of the six NL playoff teams coming from the division. This season, they are winning at just a .466 clip.\n\nThe Phillies have feasted on lesser competition so far in teams like the lowly Rockies, Padres and Giants. They should be able to win the division if they can have a solidly winning record against the Marlins, Nationals and Mets -- and win the season series against the Braves. Simple, right?\n\nIn the coming weeks, the Phillies will have 19 of their next 22 games against bad teams (the lone exception being a home matchup against the defending World Series champion Rangers on May 21). After that stretch, they'll play 12 of 20 games versus teams with winning records, and if you include the Diamondbacks as a formidable team (they're currently below .500) that will be 15 of 20 teams from June 3 through June 26 that are intimidating baseball teams. Their June slate includes a series against the first place Brewers and the first place Orioles -- as well as a pair of games across the pond in London against the Mets.\n\nA different kind of test will come for the Phillies in June.

The two-time National League MVP has nine homers and 28 RBIs in 34 games this season.\n\n\"He's a perfectionist,\" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said of Harper, who had reconstructive elbow surgery last year. \"He wants to do well for his team, this city and the organization.\"\n\nThe Phillies are without shortstop Trea Turner (hamstring), who has twice led the league in steals.\n\nIn fact, Turner has 40 steals and has been caught just once since the start of the 2023 season.\n\nHowever, even without Turner, the Phillies still have a dangerous lineup that includes Harper, Schwarber (102 homers since the start of 2022); and right fielder Nick Castellanos (three 100-plus RBI seasons since 2017).\n\nOn the mound, the Phillies will turn to left-hander Ranger Suarez (6-0, 1.77 ERA) to start Friday's game.\n\nThanks to an elite curve and a fastball that produces a high volume of ground balls, Suarez is 35-21 with a 3.25 ERA in his career. He is 4-2 with a 3.24 ERA in 18 career games (seven starts) versus the Marlins.\n\nOn the other side on Friday will be the Marlins, who already trail the Phillies by 16 1/2 games in the NL East.\n\nMiami will be making the long trip home from the West Coast, where the Marlins lost five of six games. That includes losing a series to the low-budget Oakland A's and getting swept in three games by the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\"It's tough to win with just one run,\" Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said after Miami's 3-1 loss to the Dodgers on Wednesday. \"We couldn't get anything going.\"\n\nThe Marlins are batting just .225, giving them the seventh-worst average in the majors entering play on Thursday. Miami's 47 doubles are the second fewest in the majors.\n\nIn a sense, that sweep this past weekend was understandable because the Dodgers have baseball's third-highest payroll. Miami's payroll of $97 million ranks 26th in the majors.\n\nHowever, Oakland's payroll of $61 million ranks last in baseball, making that series loss tougher to take.\n\nThe Phillies, by the way, rank fourth in payroll ($243 million).\n\nMiami will turn to left-hander Trevor Rogers (0-5, 6.15) to start Friday's game.\n\nRogers, 26, is 5-18 since the start of 2022. The Marlins are winless when he starts this season (0-7).\n\nIn nine career starts against the Phillies, Rogers is 1-5 with a 6.70 ERA.\n\nOffensively, the Marlins are powered by outfielder Bryan De La Cruz, who leads the team in doubles (eight), homers (eight), RBIs (21) and OPS (.790).\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"},

Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, and New York Yankees have recognized the Phillies are an elite team and popped them up to second behind Team Mookie-Shohei:\n\nWhat does it mean in the grand scheme of things? After all, the MLB season hasn't quite reached the quarter pole. The Phillies will get there after a weekend series in Miami where the attendance will give them flashbacks to the 2020 pandemic season when only cardboard cutouts were in the stands.\n\nThere's still a lot of baseball to be played, but enough historical data about a start this good that it could provide a glimpse of what to expect for this Phillies team going forward.\n\nTo take a really good glance at it, I did some research.\n\nOK. That's a lie. I didn't do all the research. Major props go out to Conestoga High School senior Aidan Gregory - who, for his final requirement before graduation, for some reason chose to spend a month being my personal intern. He did all the digging and created this amazing, color-coded spreadsheet. I just crunched some late-night numbers that he sent me to put it together. But seriously, great work by the kid.\n\nThe Phillies are just the 112th team in the World Series era (since 1903) to win at least 26 of their first 38 games. Now, in a vacuum, that doesn't sound very exclusive, does it? I mean, if something happens a handful of times, then yes, it's a wow. But 112 times, is a bit more meh, right?\n\nExcept when you contextualize it, it's starts to get more and more impressive.\n\nConsider that it's the 112th time in 122 major league seasons - which means it happens less than once a year. Even more telling is that in those 122 years of the MLB, there have been 2,644 individual team seasons. That means that 112 of them is just 4.2% of every season ever played by every team.\n\nThat looks a little better, right? Oh, but wait, there's more.\n\nOf those previous 111 teams to be as prolific as the Phillies have been so far this season, 41 of them (36.9%) have gone on to win 100 or more games in a season. that's a pretty good number. But do you know what the most eye-popping number of them all is?\n\nNo, it has nothing to do with Joe DiMaggio's hitting steak, or Joe Blanton's uniform.\n\nIt is the number of these fast start teams who have reached the World Series a little more than five month later. That's more than half of them (50.4%).\n\nA pretty good rate, yeah?\n\nOf those 56, a total of 33 of them won the World Series. The most recent was the 2020 Dodgers.\n\nYou're right, but that season doesn't count because it was only 60 games long and played almost entirely in empty ballparks.\n\nO.K. That means the most recent in a real season was the 2017 Houston Astros.\n\nUm.... They cheated, and everyone knows it. Throw them out, too.\n\nO.K. then the last legitimate team to get off to this fast a start who won a World Series was the 2016 Chicago Cubs. Any quibbles there?\n\nAs for the last time it happened where a team reached the World Series but lost, it was the 2020 Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nAhem...\n\nFine. The 2003 New York Yankees, who were upset in the Fall Classic by the Florida Marlins.\n\nThe point is, that if past is prologue, there is a really good chance that these Phillies at least reach the World Series, if not actually win the whole shebang.\n\nI mean, ask yourself, if five weeks ago - which was the last time the Phillies lost a series and were 2-4 after six games - if you would take these historical percentages on reaching and/or winning the World Series as a comparator for how the Phils were playing. Admit it, you'd be over the moon answering yourself with a certifiable yes.\n\nThat's how good the Phillies have been - to get you to this point.\n\nBut it should not be overlooked that nearly half the teams who got off to this good a start also did NOT make the World Series. Here are some numbers:\n\nWoah. That last one is a big number. Can teams really collapse that badly?\n\nWell, yeah. Anything is possible - and for a variety of reasons, but it should be noted that only five of these teams have missed the playoffs in the wild card era, and they were all back when there was only one wild card team in each league. There are now three.\n\nAnd those five teams all would have been in the playoffs in those years had there been three wild cards:\n\n(The Diamondbacks would have been tied with Cincinnati for the No. 6 seed. How that tie would have been broken is unknown because there wasn't a balanced schedule then, so head-to-head would have been unlikely. It probably would have resulted in a one-game playoff to see who got in.)\n\nI point all this out to show that there is no indication whatsoever that a team starting this well would miss the playoffs entirely in a season where six teams from each league make it.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's impossible, though. The other 30 teams who missed the playoffs did so before there was a wild card, so they were simply caught in the divisional race, or pre-1969, the league standings, by another team. But there were three epic collapses where not only did the team that got off to such a great start miss the playoffs, but they fell apart enough to not even finish with a winning record.\n\nBelieve it or not, all three times it was the same franchise:\n\nNo wonder it sucks to be a Cleveland sports fan. Even in the years they don't make the playoffs there's a chance at heartbreak.\n\nAnyway, back to the 2024 Phillies. A quick glance at their upcoming schedule for the next 30 days, and you'll see there's a chance for this record to get even more crazy good:\n\nThat's right, just six games - all at home - against teams with winning records in the next 27 contests.\n\nSomething tells me we'll be doing more historical comparisons with this team in the not-too-distant future. Speaking of history, I'll leave you with one last look at the past.", "source": {"uri": "crossingbroad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crossing Broad"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_sanfilippo@crossingbroad.com", "name": "Anthony SanFilippo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bassitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bassitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Blanton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Blanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_DiMaggio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe DiMaggio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tampa_Bay_Rays_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Tampa Bay Rays season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-game_playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One-game playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.crossingbroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23220958_168399969_lowres-1200x628.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553981", "eventUri": "eng-9553981", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Just how real are the Philadelphia Phillies? Coming into the 2024 season, all of the talk was about the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Atlanta Braves being the two best teams in the game. But everyone sort of forgot about the club that has knocked Atlanta out of the postseason the past two years.\n\nIt's still early, but the Phillies are absolutely on fire at 26-12, two games better than the Braves, and their .684 winning percentage also ranks tops in baseball.\n\nThey're 8-2 in their last 10 and have won 11 of 13. At this point in the season last year, the team was 19-19 and had spent most of that time playing without Bryce Harper.\n\nPhiladelphia's plus-52 run differential ranks second in baseball behind the Dodgers, and the club ranks fourth in runs scored (191), third in wRC+ (115), and fifth in ERA (3.26).\n\nAtlanta fans will point out that in the one series he two clubs have played, the Braves took two of three. However, that was the first series of the season, and since then Atlanta's ace, Spencer Strider, underwent season-ending surgery. The team that faced Philly at the end of March is not the same one that will match up with them for the rest of 2024.\n\nThe reason for their early-season success is simply production, so let's take a look at who is stepping up.\n\nRelated: Philadelphia Phillies schedule and live results\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies hung eight runs on Jose Berrios in 3.1 inning and 10 total on the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday, one of the better pitchers in baseball on one of the better teams in the game.\n\nBerrios, after this outing, still holds a 2.85 ERA, which is double what it was coming into the contest. Bryce Harper landed the big blow with a grand slam in the fourth. And while his nine home runs on the year are tied for seventh in baseball, the supporting stars have been much more apparent this year for the Phillies.\n\nFirst up, there's Trea Turner, who struggled (in his terms) after signing a $300 million contract with Philadelphia before the 2023 campaign.\n\nThis year, he's performing at close to his peak, holding a 146 wRC+ (100 is league average) while batting .343 with a .392 OBP and ten stolen bases. In Turner's first year with Philly, he hit .247 in the first half and had an 84 wRC+. Phillies fans notably gave the struggling star a standing ovation and he ended the second half with a 140 wRC+, and has kept that bat hot to begin this season.\n\nAlec Bohm was splitting time between first and third base last season with Rhys Hoskins out and Harper relegated to DH duty. His defense is looking better, his hitting profile is better, and he's been the team's best bat so far this season with a 172 wRC+ through 36 games.\n\nThat comes with a .346 average, a .413 on-base, and 32 runs batted in, which ranks third among all hitters. While his .393 BABIP suggests that he won't keep this pace forever, he's making solid contact consistently, not chasing, not whiffing, and his expected batting average (xBA) is still an impressive .310 based off of those contact numbers.\n\nThe scary part? Their offense may even have room to improve. One of their big sluggers, Nick Castellanos, is off to his worst season since his rookie year back in 2013 with the Tigers. His 61 wRC+ ranks 162 out of 175 qualified bats and comes with a .197 average and a .265 on-base.\n\nHis chase and whiff rates are bad, but they were bad last year too. The biggest difference between this year and last is that he's not barreling balls up like he has in the past. If that changes, the league could be in serious trouble.\n\nRelated: Updated Philadelphia Phillies news and rumors\n\nSince the beginning of the 2021 season, Zack Wheeler holds a 2.96 ERA across 607.2 innings. Through eight starts this season, he holds a 1.64 ERA with a 2.31 FIP and his 1.8 fWAR ranks tops among all pitchers this season.\n\nHeck, there are only nine position players that rank above him in WAR this year. Despite this continued greatness, he has made just one All Star team in the past three years. There's a good chance Wheeler makes the team this year, perhaps even starts the game. He's Philly's underrated ace, and he ranks third in ERA among qualified starters. The two guys ahead of him, Shota Imanaga and Reynaldo L\u00f3pez, have also tossed way fewer innings.\n\nThe Phillies are so stacked in the rotation that their fill-in starter Spencer Turbull, who held a 1.67 ERA in six starts, was moved to the bullpen when Taijuan Walker returned from the IL at the end of April.\n\nRanger Su\u00e1rez, who is known for his postseason performances the past two years, has also taken a big step forward this season. He's getting weaker contact and forcing opposing hitters to put the ball on the ground more often, leading to a 1.72 ERA through seven starts.\n\nBoth his ground ball rate and his hard hit rate rank in the 95 percentile, and his average exit velocity (82.7) ranks in the 99. In other words, batters aren't hitting the ball hard against him, and they're also not getting it in the air.\n\nSince joining the Phillies for the 2023 season, Jeff Hoffman has been a full-time reliever, and a pretty good one at that. In the red pinstripes he has racked up 68.1 innings to the tune of a 2.11 ERA. This year he holds a 1.13 ERA and his 39.3% strikeout rate is by far the highest of his career.\n\nHis slider has always generated whiffs at a high clip (44%), but this year he's pairing it with a mid-90's four-seamer that is generating whiffs 36.4% of the time, up 15% over last season on the pitch.\n\nPart of the reason is that he's added a little more movement on the heater, doubling his vertical movement from last season, while also adding a little horizontal movement, moving it into the top-10 among all fastballs in horizontal movement.\n\nRelated: MLB Playoff and World Series predictions\n\nDespite the incredible start, the Phillies still hold just a 6.7% chance of winning the World Series, which is roughly one-third the odds that Atlanta is being given.\n\nWhile those odds seem low, they're not too bad. The Dodgers (20%) and Braves (18.5%) lead the pack by a large margin, but below them are the Yankees (10.3%) and Orioles (7.6%), then the Phillies. That's right around the range that the Phillies should probably be grouped in for now.\n\nHowever, if the Phillies keep playing ball the way they have been, they should see those odds rise. Even if they don't, Philadelphia has shown the past two years that they are a team to be feared in October, being that they've made it further than any of those four teams the past couple of seasons.\n\nThis team is dangerous, and with series against the Marlins, Mets, Nationals, Rockies, and Giants this month, they can start to separate from the pack a little bit.", "source": {"uri":

The two-time National League MVP has nine homers and 28 RBIs in 34 games this season.\n\n\"He's a perfectionist,\" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said of Harper, who had reconstructive elbow surgery last year. \"He wants to do well for his team, this city and the organization.\"\n\nThe Phillies are without shortstop Trea Turner (hamstring), who has twice led the league in steals.\n\nIn fact, Turner has 40 steals and has been caught just once since the start of the 2023 season.\n\nHowever, even without Turner, the Phillies still have a dangerous lineup that includes Harper, Schwarber (102 homers since the start of 2022); and right fielder Nick Castellanos (three 100-plus RBI seasons since 2017).\n\nOn the mound, the Phillies will turn to left-hander Ranger Suarez (6-0, 1.77 ERA) to start Friday's game.\n\nThanks to an elite curve and a fastball that produces a high volume of ground balls, Suarez is 35-21 with a 3.25 ERA in his career. He is 4-2 with a 3.24 ERA in 18 career games (seven starts) versus the Marlins.\n\nOn the other side on Friday will be the Marlins, who already trail the Phillies by 16 1/2 games in the NL East.\n\nMiami will be making the long trip home from the West Coast, where the Marlins lost five of six games. That includes losing a series to the low-budget Oakland A's and getting swept in three games by the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\"It's tough to win with just one run,\" Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said after Miami's 3-1 loss to the Dodgers on Wednesday. \"We couldn't get anything going.\"\n\nThe Marlins are batting just .225, giving them the seventh-worst average in the majors entering play on Thursday. Miami's 47 doubles are the second fewest in the majors.\n\nIn a sense, that sweep this past weekend was understandable because the Dodgers have baseball's third-highest payroll. Miami's payroll of $97 million ranks 26th in the majors.\n\nHowever, Oakland's payroll of $61 million ranks last in baseball, making that series loss tougher to take.\n\nThe Phillies, by the way, rank fourth in payroll ($243 million).\n\nMiami will turn to left-hander Trevor Rogers (0-5, 6.15) to start Friday's game.\n\nOffensively, the Marlins are powered by outfielder Bryan De La Cruz, who leads the team in doubles (eight), homers (eight), RBIs (21) and OPS (.790).", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is time to continue our MLB odds series with a Phillies-Marlins prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies and Miami Marlins get Thursday off before their National League East showdown this weekend. The Phillies had won seven games consecutively before dropping the second game of a two-game set to the Blue Jays. The Marlins have taken a nose dive since trading away Luis Arraez, as management signaled to the players that they weren't interested in winning this season. They have lost five of six games since the move, including two losses to the equally abysmal Oakland Athletics. The Arraez trade may not be the last move from the Marlins. It is time to continue our MLB odds series with a Phillies-Marlins prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nThe starters haven't been announced yet for either team, but Ranger Suarez is in line to take the mound for the Phillies. A pitcher with seven starts and a 1.72 ERA would be any team's best option, but Spencer Turnbull is having a better season statistically. Suarez had a three-game stretch where he allowed zero earned runs in 22 innings, including a complete game against the Rockies. He has come back down to earth over his last two starts, but that was allowing four earned runs over 14 innings. Suarez has won six straight decisions, and the Phillies have won every start.\n\nThe Marlins starting pitching has been dreadful, and Trevor Rogers will try to slow down the Phillies in this game. Rogers allowed eight earned runs in 2 1/3 innings against the Oakland Athletics, an outing that won't give much hope in his abilities. Rogers owns a couple of good outings, but he is 0-5 with a 6.15 ERA.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies offense is clicking at a level that has led them to many playoff runs over the past few seasons. They have a whopping .358 on-base percentage and are averaging 6.8 runs/nine over their last ten games.\n\nThe Phillies' home-field advantage in the playoffs is second to none when they get going, but so far in 2024, they have been just as good on the road. Philadelphia owns an 11-5 road record, but their offense does take a bit of a hit away from Citizens Bank Park.\n\nWhy The Marlins Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThere is no way to sugarcoat it. The Marlins' chances of winning in this game are very slim. The odds reflect that, and if you don't want to pay for the juice Philadelphia offers, you can take the Marlins and hope they can find a way to win. The thing about baseball is that it's a long season, and there are some surprising victories throughout 162 games.\n\nIf you want one good stat, the Marlins offense has improved over the last ten games. They are batting .226 and averaging 4.1 runs/nine. Those numbers still aren't spectacular, but they are better than their total season averages.\n\nFinal Phillies-Marlins Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Marlins looked to finally be a contender in the National League when they made the playoffs last season, but this season has been a return to mediocrity. Ranger Suarez hit rock bottom in his recent start when he gave up eight earned runs to the Oakland Athletics. It will be a lot more difficult facing the red-hot Phillies lineup on Friday night, and the Marlins don't have much offense of their own to give Suarez any support. Take the Phillies to win big in this one.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Turnbull", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Turnbull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Complete game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Phillies-vs.-Marlins-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553981", "eventUri": "eng-9553981", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Philadelphia has been on an absolute tear over the last three weeks, going 18-4 since starting the year 8-8.\n\nThe Phillies are dominating the competition and are almost a quarter of the way through their schedule. It's fair to wonder -- are they the best team in baseball?\n\nBefore the season started, many fans and pundits considered Philadelphia just a tick below the top teams in baseball like the Dodgers, Atlanta Braves and Baltimore Orioles, all of whom won at least 10 more games than the Phillies last year. Philadelphia didn't add much in the offseason, either, losing closer Craig Kimbrel in free agency and missing out on top free-agent target Yoshinobu Yamamoto.\n\nBut despite getting another year older, the Phillies have gotten off to their best start ever. After blowing the NLCS against an inferior Arizona Diamondbacks squad last fall, Philadelphia is playing like a team on a mission this season.\n\nLed by the red-hot Bryce Harper and breakout star Alec Bohm, the Phillies boast one of the most potent lineups in baseball. Among National League teams, they rank top 3 in runs, hits, homers, walks, AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS and total bases.\n\nMeanwhile, the pitching staff has been lights-out. Anchored by the best rotation in baseball, Philadelphia ranks second in ERA and first in strikeouts among NL teams. The bullpen's been more of a mixed bag, but the Phillies still have plenty of time to upgrade there before the trade deadline.\n\nOther teams may have more talent, but Philadelphia's stellar starting pitching and powerful lineup has proven to be a successful combination. If the Phillies keep playing like this, there's no reason they can't make another deep playoff run and be the last team standing in October.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kimbrel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Kimbrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Bohm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Bohm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_bases", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Total bases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3022,h_1699,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_phillies/01hxfjym40tyvdbcd26m.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553981", "eventUri": "eng-9553981", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 452990981, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 17, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 17}}}

Filmmaker James Gunn announced the wrap for his highly-awaited Superman, expressing gratitude to all who made the filming leg possible. In an Instagram post, Gunn shared a long post along with a picture from the first week of shooting in snow-clad Svalbard, Norway. Notably, the film will mark a new era of DC through Gunn and Peter Safran's rebooted DC universe.\n\nAnnouncing Superman's wrap, Gunn wrote, \"And that's a wrap. God bless our cast and crew whose commitment, creativity, and hard work have brought this project to life. I set out to make a movie about a good man in a world that isn't always so much. And the goodness and kindness and love I've encountered on a daily basis on the set has inspired me and thrust me forward when I felt too spent to move on my own. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. It has been an honor.\"\n\nThe filmmaker went on to speak about their Superman journey, stating that it has been a mix of toil, laughter, emotions, ideas and magic that they have shared together on sets.\n\nThe announcement came days after DC Studios revealed plans for future projects in the superhero franchise at the Comic-Con this year. While Gunn personally couldn't attend the event due to ongoing production, Safran announced that they had finally completed the principal photography.\n\n\"From my perspective, it's just too soon. A year is truthfully a long time for a campaign and so, from our perspective, I think we go stronger and harder over a shorter period, rather than stretching it out. That's our instinct on that. Believe me, there's gonna be no shortage of Superman in your life over the next 12 months,\" he said while explaining why Superman opted out this year.\n\nStarring David Corenswet as the new Man of Steel, Superman also features Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor.\n\nAmong others are Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner, and Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.

The destination has been Superman, but the journey has been the toil and the laughter and the emotions and ideas and magic we've shared together on set - and for that I am forever grateful. \u2764\ufe0f\"\n\n\"Overjoyed to be announcing the start of principal photography on SUPERMAN today, February 29, which just so happens to be - coincidentally and unplanned - Superman's birthday,\" Gunn wrote as the caption to his post presenting the famous \"S\" on his Superman's costume, before confirming the change in the film's title. \"When I finished the first draft of the script, I called the film Superman: Legacy. By the time I locked the final draft, it was clear the title was SUPERMAN. Making our way to you July 2025.\"\n\nHere's a look back at a screencap of Gunn's Threads post sharing a group shot of the cast (and with Nicholas Hoult definitely in Lex Luthor mode) from the table read:\n\n\"After the table read with the #Superman cast. Eve, Mr. Terrific, Superman/Clark, Otis, Lex, producer Peter Safran, Jimmy, Metamorpho, Lois, Hawkgirl, me, Guy, The Engineer all together for the first time! What a wonderful day.\" Gunn wrote as the caption to his Instagram post showing off the team:\n\n#Cleveland - today we are leaving you after six amazing weeks of shooting,\" Gunn wrote to kick off the caption to the image gallery he shared in mid-July of the team's experiences filming in the city. \"From the moment we first came here on a scout a tad less than a year ago and Terminal Tower was lit up with the colors of Superman, I knew you were a special place. I would walk down your streets and someone would stop me and tell me how grateful they were we were shooting in their city - not once, not twice, but dozens of times. The wonderful background actors on the film were always so fun and funny and they clapped after takes, something that reminded us Hollywood cynics why we make movies in the first place.\"\n\nGunn continued, \"The pride you feel in being where Jerry and Joe first created Superman was invigorating. You exemplify his spirit. But just as much it's the pride you have in your community, your hometown, your radio stations and restaurants and gathering places that touched me. Every city would be so lucky to have people that loved their city as much as you. You simply couldn't have been more wonderful, kind, or accommodating to me and our performers and crew. Thank you a thousand times over for being our friends and partners on this film. Much love to you all.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udddc\u2642\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\" Here's a look at Gunn's original post:\n\nHere's a look back at Gunn's tweet from March 2023 making the announcement that he would be writing and directing Superman: Legacy, followed by the full, heartfelt text of the message he shared while confirming what's been rumbling around social media since the previous week:\n\n\"Yes, I'm directing Superman: Legacy to be released on July 11, 2025. My brother Matt told me when he saw the release date he started to cry. I asked him why. He said, 'Dude, it's Dad's birthday.' I hadn't realized,\" Gunn wrote in the opening to his series of tweets announcing the news. \"I lost my Dad almost three years ago. He was my best friend. He didn't understand me as a kid, but he supported my love of comics and my love of film, and I wouldn't be making this movie now without him. It has been a long road to this point. I was offered Superman years ago - I initially said no because I didn't have a way in that felt unique and fun and emotional that gave Superman the dignity he deserved. Then a bit less than a year ago, I saw a way in, in many ways, centering around Superman's heritage - how both his aristocratic Kryptonian parents and his Kansas farmer parents inform who he is and the choices he makes.\"", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ray_flook@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Ray Flook", "type": "author",

It has been an honor. The destination has been Superman, but the journey has been the toil and the laughter and the emotions and ideas and magic we've shared on set - and for that, I am forever grateful.\"\n\nThe upcoming \"Superman\" film, initially titled \"Superman: Legacy,\" boasts an impressive lineup of actors. David Corenswet stars as the Man of Steel, with Rachel Brosnahan, an Emmy winner for \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" playing Lois Lane. Nicholas Hoult takes on the role of the infamous villain Lex Luthor, while Skyler Gisondo, Anthony Carrigan, Edi Gathegi, Nathan Fillion, and Isabela Merced round out the cast as Jimmy Olsen, Metamorpho, Mister Terrific, Guy Gardner, and Hawkgirl, respectively.\n\nIn a touching nod to the legacy of Superman, Will Reeve, the son of the late Christopher Reeve, will make a cameo as a TV reporter. Christopher Reeve's portrayal of Superman in four films, starting with Richard Donner's iconic 1978 \"Superman,\" left an indelible mark on the character's history. Will Reeve shared his experience with TMZ, saying, \"I know the folks making the film, and they've been so kind to me and my family, and I had a free day, so we made it happen.\"\n\nReeve described his cameo as \"a great experience,\" despite feeling more nervous than usual. \"It was quick, easy... I was more nervous doing that than I am whenever I'm on TV for my normal job because there were so many people around and I had to memorize one line, but still!\"\n\nThe movie's six-week shoot took place in Cleveland, where Will Reeve filmed his cameo. Despite wrapping the main shoot, Gunn noted, \"We are not done shooting,\" indicating that there are still a few weeks left to complete the project. He emphasized the long but rewarding process, saying, \"It's a long shoot...but we're getting close!!\"\n\nChristopher Reeve's children, including Will, have been actively celebrating their father's legacy this year. The documentary \"Super/Man,\" which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was acquired by Warner Bros. for around $15 million, highlights the life and career of the beloved actor. Will, along with his siblings Matthew and Alexandra, appear in the film and were present at the festival to promote it.\n\nAlexandra Reeve told Variety that the documentary is a \"beautiful gift,\" offering a rare glimpse into their father's life. \"To see a life well-lived on screen and in its full complexity... We wanted people to see the highs and lows, the public facade, and what's happening at home.\"\n\nMatthew Reeve added, \"We not only have his films to look at but a collection of home movies to dig up and go through and interviews on YouTube of him to pull up. Seeing things I hadn't seen before didn't change my perception of him but enhanced it...like some rare Australian interview done in 1977 that was uploaded and I didn't know existed. It was pretty cool to see that and uncover a lot more material than we knew about.\"\n\nAs the curtain falls on the filming of \"Superman,\" anticipation builds for its release. James Gunn's heartfelt tribute to his cast and crew, coupled with the legacy of the Reeve family, promises a new and inspiring chapter for the Man of Steel.\n\nGunn's \"Superman\" movie is set to kick off the rebooted DC Universe, overseen by Gunn and his DC Studios co-boss Peter Safran. The film is scheduled to hit theaters on July 11, 2025, promising a new era for Superman and his fans.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"},

He is the embodiment of truth, justice and a better tomorrow, guided by human kindness in a world that sees kindness as old-fashioned.\n\nSuperman will also star Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Wendell Pierce as Perry White, Sara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher, Terence Rosemore as Otis, Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda as Angela Spica / The Engineer, Isabela Merced as Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl, Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner, Edi Gathegi as Michael Holt / Mr. Terrific, Anthony Carrigan as Rex Mason / Metamorpho, Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, Mikaela Hoover as Cat Grant, and Christopher McDonald as Ron Troupe.\n\nThe DC Universe Slate\n\nThe first chapter of DC Studios' DC Universe slate will include 2025's Superman, 2026's Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, as well as the currently-undated movies The Brave and the Bold, Swamp Thing, and The Authority. On the television side, the DC Universe will launch an animated Creature Commandos series, the sophomore season of Peacemaker, as well as future shows Waller, Booster Gold, Lanterns, and Paradise Lost. An animated Jurassic League movie and a live-action Teen Titans movie are also reported to be in the works, but neither have been officially confirmed by DC Studios.\n\n\"A lot of people think it's going to be Marvel 2.0, and definitely I learned a lot of stuff at Marvel. I think that we have a lot of differences,\" Gunn explained in January of 2023. \"We are telling a big, huge, central story that is like Marvel, except for, I think that we're a lot more planned out than Marvel from the beginning because we've gotten a group of writers together to work that story out completely. But we're also creating a universe that is like Star Wars, where there's different times, different places, different things, or Game of Thrones, where characters are a little bit more morally complex.\"\n\nSuperman will be released exclusively in theaters on July 11, 2025.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

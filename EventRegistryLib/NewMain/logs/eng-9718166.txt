Mary Carbone pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter for the 2020 killing of Frank Stochel.\n\nFollowing an indictment by an Ocean County grand jury in October 2021 on charges including murder, unlawful possession of a weapon, and tampering with evidence, Carbone struck a deal with prosecutors due to uncertainties in the evidence. As part of the agreement, Carbone accepted guilt for a lesser charge.\n\nProsecutors are aiming for a 10-year prison sentence in a state correctional facility under the No Early Release Act. This act mandates that offenders must serve a minimum of 85% of the imposed sentence before being considered for parole.\n\nAccording to a news release from the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, officers with the Manchester Township Police Department on Feb. 24, 2020, responded to a residence on 6th Avenue in the Pine Lake Park section of Manchester in regards to a call about an unresponsive male. The home is about 60 miles south of Manhattan.\n\nUpon arriving at the address, first responders said they found Stochel's lifeless body on the floor inside the residence.\n\nThe Ocean County Medical Examiner performed an autopsy and determined that his manner of death was a homicide. Authorities soon learned that the circumstances of the slaying were particularly brutal and bizarre.\n\n\"The investigation further revealed that several household items were utilized in the commission of the homicide: specifically, a wooden board, a heavy duty tape dispenser, and a shower curtain rod were recovered from the scene,\" the release states. \"The injuries sustained by Mr. Stochel were consistent with the implementation of these items.\"\n\nInvestigators said Stochel was beaten to death with the tape dispenser and shower rod, while Carbone used the wooden board to try and suffocate the victim, according to the Asbury Park Press.\n\nMultiple local law enforcement agencies were charged with investigating Stochel's murder and authorities soon learned that Stochel and Carbone both lived in the 6th Avenue home.\n\nWhen questioned about Stochel's death, Carbone initially told police that she had no idea what happened and she had just discovered the body in the hallway earlier that day, NJ Advance Media reported, citing court documents. However, the shower curtain rod used in the attack -- which was found in a trash bin behind the house -- had Carbone's bloody fingerprints on it.\n\nCarbone was reportedly one of several roommates Stochel had found on Craigslist who were renting rooms from his home.\n\nInvestigators ultimately determined that Carbone was the individual responsible for beating Stochel to death and she was arrested on March 4, 2021.\n\nOcean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer addressed the seemingly light sentence for such a brutal act of violence.\n\n\"Although Mary Carbone was originally facing a murder charge in connection with Mr. Stochel's death, legitimate proof issues arose during the course of our investigation that we simply could not ignore, and which we were ethically bound to take into account in evaluating this very difficult case,\" Billhimer said in a statement following the plea hearing. \"We believe this to be a just and reasonable resolution after careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances.\"\n\nCarbone, who has been incarcerated since her arrest, is scheduled to appear for her sentencing hearing on Sept. 13.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors":

She said at the hearing that the medical examiner who conducted Sochel's autopsy opined that he suffered a prolonged period of torture.\n\nZager at the 2020 hearing said Sochel, when his body was discovered, had in his hand a medieval mace, an implement devised of a piece of wood with a chain and ball with spikes attached to it, which he said supported a theory that Carbone was defending herself.\n\nMore on the Manchester murder: Victim was facedown with a 'medieval-style mace' under his hand\n\nAuthorities allege that in addition to beating Sochel with various household items, she also tried to strangle him with a piece of wood.\n\nO'Neill last week said the plea offer was extended to Carbone after an expert for the state agreed with some of the conclusions of a defense expert

She said at the hearing that the medical examiner who conducted Sochel's autopsy opined that he suffered a prolonged period of torture.\n\nZager at the 2020 hearing said Sochel, when his body was discovered, had in his hand a medieval mace, an implement devised of a piece of wood with a chain and ball with spikes attached to it, which he said supported a theory that Carbone was defending herself.\n\nMore on the Manchester murder: Victim was facedown with a 'medieval-style mace' under his hand\n\nAuthorities allege that in addition to beating Sochel with various household items, she also tried to strangle him with a piece of wood.\n\nO'Neill last week said the plea offer was extended to Carbone after an expert for the state agreed with some of the conclusions of a defense expert who evaluated the defendant for battered women's syndrome.\n\nKathleen Hopkins, a reporter in New Jersey since 1985, covers crime, court cases, legal issues, unsolved mysteries and just about every major murder trial to hit Monmouth and Ocean counties.

Mary Carbone on Monday pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated manslaughter in the 2020 slaying of Frank Stochel, authorities announced.\n\nAn Ocean County, New Jersey, grand jury in October 2021 indicted Carbone on charges of murder, unlawful possession of a weapon, and tampering with physical evidence. Prosecutors said \"legitimate proof issues\" led them to make a deal with Carbone if she agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge.\n\nProsecutors said they are seeking a sentence of 10 years in a state correctional facility subject to the terms of the No Early Release Act, which requires the convict to serve at least 85% of the sentence imposed before becoming eligible for parole.\n\nAccording to a news release from the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, officers with the Manchester Township Police Department on Feb. 24, 2020, responded to a residence on 6th Avenue in the Pine Lake Park section of Manchester in regards to a call about an unresponsive male. The home is about 60 miles south of Manhattan.\n\nUpon arriving at the address, first responders said they found Stochel's lifeless body on the floor inside the residence.\n\nThe Ocean County Medical Examiner performed an autopsy and determined that his manner of death was a homicide. Authorities soon learned that the circumstances of the slaying were particularly brutal and bizarre.\n\n\"The investigation further revealed that several household items were utilized in the commission of the homicide: specifically, a wooden board, a heavy duty tape dispenser, and a shower curtain rod were recovered from the scene,\" the release states. \"The injuries sustained by Mr. Stochel were consistent with the implementation of these items.\"\n\nInvestigators said Stochel was beaten to death with the tape dispenser and shower rod, while Carbone used the wooden board to try and suffocate the victim, according to the Asbury Park Press.\n\nMultiple local law enforcement agencies were charged with investigating Stochel's murder and authorities soon learned that Stochel and Carbone both lived in the 6th Avenue home.\n\nWhen questioned about Stochel's death, Carbone initially told police that she had no idea what happened and she had just discovered the body in the hallway earlier that day, NJ Advance Media reported, citing court documents. However, the shower curtain rod used in the attack -- which was found in a trash bin behind the house -- had Carbone's bloody fingerprints on it.\n\nCarbone was reportedly one of several roommates Stochel had found on Craigslist who were renting rooms from his home.\n\nInvestigators ultimately determined that Carbone was the individual responsible for beating Stochel to death and she was arrested on March 4, 2021.\n\nOcean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer addressed the seemingly light sentence for such a brutal act of violence.\n\n\"Although Mary Carbone was originally facing a murder charge in connection with Mr. Stochel's death, legitimate proof issues arose during the course of our investigation that we simply could not ignore, and which we were ethically bound to take into account in evaluating this very difficult case,\" Billhimer said in a statement following the plea hearing. \"We believe this to be a just and reasonable resolution after careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances.\"\n\nBillhimer also noted that Stochel's family was consulted in connection with Carbone's plea deal and approved.\n\nCarbone, who has been incarcerated since her arrest, is scheduled to appear for her sentencing hearing on Sept. 13.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc",

She was also indicted on three counts of Possession of a Weapon for an Unlawful Purpose in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4d, three counts of Unlawful Possession of a Weapon in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5d, and Tampering with Physical Evidence in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:28-6(1).\n\nOn February 24, 2020, Manchester Township Police responded to a residence on 6th Avenue in the Pine Lake Park section for a report of an unresponsive male. Upon arrival, officers found the lifeless body of Mr. Stochel lying on the floor of the residence. A post-mortem examination conducted by the Ocean County Medical Examiner on February 25, 2020, ruled the manner of death to be a homicide.\n\nThe investigation by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crime Unit, Manchester Township Police Detective Bureau, and Ocean County Sheriff's Office Crime Scene Investigation Unit revealed that Carbone and Stochel both resided at the 6th Avenue residence.

The injuries sustained by Mr. Stochel were consistent with the use of these items. Further investigation determined that Carbone was responsible for Mr. Stochel's death.\n\nCarbone was arrested and charged on March 4, 2021, and has been held in the Ocean County Jail since that date.", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ocean County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ocean County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Township, New Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toms_River,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toms River, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toms River, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Lake_Park,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pine Lake Park, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pine Lake Park, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_dispenser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tape dispenser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/murderSus.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718166", "eventUri": "eng-9718166", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ocean County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-24", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 248, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-25", "textStart": 993, "textEnd": 1010}], "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The Medical Examiner determined the death was a homicide.\n\nInvestigators said Carbone killed Stochel with a shower curtain rod, tape dispenser and a wooden board in the pair's 6th Avenue residence.\n\n\"Although Mary Carbone was originally facing a murder charge in connection with Mr. Stochel's death, legitimate proof issues arose during the course of our investigation that we simply could not ignore, and which we were ethically bound to take into account in evaluating this very difficult case,\" Prosecutor Bradley D.

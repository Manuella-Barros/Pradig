{"id": 231970008, "title": "EU Parliament perks: Salary, allowances make seats coveted", "text": "Being a member of the European Parliament comes with a host of benefits and allowances, as revealed by Insider magazine\u2019s June issue, published today alongside the newspaper Phileleftheros. The report breaks down the various earnings of MEPs, from salaries to pensions and additional income from private activities. With 27 member states electing their representatives to the European Parliament for the 2024-2029 term, the competition for these coveted positions is fierce. The distribution of seats is based on each country\u2019s size and population, following the principle of \u2018degressive proportionality,\u2019 ensuring that MEPs from smaller countries represent a larger proportion of citizens. Cyprus is allocated six MEPs, the minimum number, while Germany holds the maximum of 96 seats. The 720 MEPs will collectively represent 450 million EU citizens, and their remuneration package is certainly attractive. In addition to their monthly salary of approximately \u20ac10,000 gross, MEPs receive various allowances and reimbursements, including general expenditure, travel, and daily subsistence allowances. Before tax, their monthly earnings exceed \u20ac17,000 gross. MEPs\u2019 salaries are unified across member states, currently standing at \u20ac10,075 per month, which, after deductions, amounts to \u20ac7,853. They are also entitled to a general expenditure allowance of \u20ac4,950 per month, covering office administration, telephone, and postal charges, among other expenses. Travel expenses are reimbursed, including the cost of airline tickets in business class or equivalent, or first-class rail tickets. MEPs further receive an allowance for other travel expenses, totaling over \u20ac4,886 per year, to cover costs beyond official meetings. The European Parliament also provides generous pension benefits, with former MEPs eligible for an old-age pension from the age of 63, amounting to 3.5% of their salary for each full year of service. To ensure transparency and compliance, newly elected MEPs will undergo a compatibility check by the European Parliament authorities to ensure they do not hold incompatible positions. The report also highlights the additional income MEPs may earn from outside activities, with some earning more from these activities than their parliamentary salaries. Insider\u2019s analysis, citing Transparency International, revealed that 70% of MEPs engage in some form of outside activity, resulting in total outside incomes of \u20ac8.7 million. To enhance transparency and address potential conflicts of interest, the EU strengthened its rules following the \u2018Qatargate\u2019 scandal last year, now requiring MEPs to disclose more details about their earnings beyond their parliamentary salaries. MEPs are supported by three categories of assistants: accredited assistants, local assistants, and trainees, with their teams receiving a total of \u20ac28,696 per month. The salaries of assistants vary across member states, with the highest monthly salaries reaching \u20ac8,519 in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden. In contrast, assistants in Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Romania receive the lowest salaries of \u20ac2,978. The extensive benefits and allowances enjoyed by MEPs certainly make their positions highly coveted, and with the ongoing election campaigns, the competition for these 720 seats is fierce.", "summary": "Being a member of the European Parliament comes with a host of benefits and allowances, as revealed by Insider magazine&#8217;s June issue, published today alongside the newspaper Phileleftheros.

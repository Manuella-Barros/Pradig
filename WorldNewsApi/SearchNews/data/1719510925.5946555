Pitted against seven quality Hong Kong stayers, Rebel\u2019s Romance surged to a two-length win over the Tony Cruz-trained pair Five G Patch and La City Blanche under Buick. It was British handler Charlie Appleby\u2019s first win in Hong Kong and Rebel\u2019s Romance is the first internationally trained horse to win the feature. Owned by Godolphin, Rebel\u2019s Romance\u2019s prowess for travelling and winning was on full display as he clinched a fifth Group 1, having also won at the highest level in Germany (twice), the United States and, more recently, the Group 1 Dubai Sheema Classic (2,410m) in March. Said Buick: \u201cThe race kind of went the way I hoped it would and it suited him... he\u2019s a real international superstar.\u201d He settled Rebel\u2019s Romance in second place, one off the fence, behind leader Moments In Time (Lyle Hewitson), and allowed the six-year-old Dubawi gelding to find his rhythm. But, once he shook off Moments In Time at the turn for home, the race was over bar the shouting. Rebel\u2019s Romance, now the winner of 13 of 19 starts, clocked 2min 25.62sec on a track rated good.

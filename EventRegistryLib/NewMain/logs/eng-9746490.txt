Central's analysis of 2024 temperatures.\n\nZoom in: In Seattle 58% of residents live in islands with temperatures that feel at least 8\u00b0 warmer than surrounding areas.\n\nHow it works: Heat islands -- urban hotspots with higher temperatures compared to surrounding areas -- are created when roads, buildings, parking lots and so on \"trap\" heat.\n\nDriving the news: Contributing factors driving the UHI index are built environments, such as roads, buildings and parking lots, a reduced percentage of green space with not enough plants to help cool the air and dense populations.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"Urban heat islands already expose residents to disproportionate heat risks and cooling costs, which will only climb as long as carbon pollution drives up global temperatures,\" said Climate Central's Jennifer Brady in a statement.\n\nCaveat: Scientists factor the heat island effect into their climate change monitoring and projections, and it does not explain the sharp uptick in global average temperatures, melting glaciers, record ocean warmth and more.\n\nThe bottom line: Cities are increasingly understanding the need to combat the heat island effect by adding more green space, using reflective paint on roads and buildings, opening cooling centers and more.\n\nWhat's next: NWS says Seattle temperatures will continue to rise over the weekend, hitting around 90\u00b0

This situation is the reality for residents in some of world's largest cities -- in the US, several parts of East Asia, and India -- during the summer, where temperatures have soared to over 40\u00b0C or 100\u00b0F.\n\nWhat's making our cities so hot? Is climate change behind this trend? How are cities in different parts of the world coping with this? It is worthwhile to explore these questions, as this issue is becoming more and more relevant for most citizens -- over 50% of the global population lives in cities.\n\nWhile the recent incidents of extreme urban heat might tempt one to think they are due to global warming, scientists attribute this to the urban heat island effect. An urban heat island occurs when a city is warmer than its surrounding suburbs or rural areas. It is calculated by taking the difference in temperature between an urban area and its rural surroundings.\n\nKnowing the difference between the heat island effect and climate change is essential. The increase in temperature due to climate change is a global phenomenon, whereas the urban heat island effect is local. Climate change means long-term changes in temperatures and weather patterns caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases, which gradually warm the planet. Urban heat islands are short-term increases in the temperature in the local area due to the city surfaces absorbing heat.\n\nFactors contributing to urban heat islands include:\n\nAlthough urban heat islands are not caused by climate change, they can be intensified by the general increase in temperature due to global warming which means one can expect them to be more frequent and intense than before. At least two studies confirm this. A recent study by the World Bank highlighted that the severity and frequency of urban heat islands are much higher today than the historical trend, now being 23 times more frequent and 10 times more potent. Another study in Nature Climate Change estimated future temperature increases due to the combined effect of climate change and the urban heat island effect in 1,692 cities worldwide. The results show that their combined effect could make one in five cities 4\u00b0C warmer by 2050.\n\nThe combined impact of climate change and urban heat islands could cost some countries as much as 10% of their GDP or their total economic output. The study published in Nature indicated that warming due to climate change alone could reduce the GDP of the average city in 2050 by 0.9% in high global warming scenarios. However, when combined with the urban heat island effect, this reduction could double, with the worst-off cities losing as much as 10% of their GDP by 2100.\n\nLarge cities with tropical climates are particularly vulnerable. The World Bank study analyzed data from 536 cities in Asia from 2012 to 2020 and found that warmer towns experienced a decrease in economic activity by as much as 5.5%.\n\nSo, what does this loss in economic output due to extreme heat mean for urban citizens? It could be visible in forms such as loss to infrastructure, productive hours, or even lives. For instance, in the UK in the summer of 2022, there were reports that rail tracks got buckled, causing several delays and cancellations. Tracks expand as they get hotter and can start to curve, called buckling.\n\nSince urban heat islands are a local phenomenon, addressing them requires local solutions. Various measures are being implemented worldwide, including increasing tree and vegetative cover, installing green roofs, and using cool pavements.

works: Heat islands -- urban hotspots with higher temperatures compared to surrounding areas -- are created when roads, buildings, parking lots and the like \"trap\" heat.\n\nDriving the news: Contributing factors driving the UHI index are built environments, such as roads, buildings and parking lots, a reduced percentage of green space with insufficient plants to help cool the air plus dense populations.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"Urban heat islands already expose residents to disproportionate heat risks and cooling costs, which will only climb as long as carbon pollution drives up global temperatures,\" said Climate Central's Jennifer Brady in a statement.\n\nCaveat: Scientists factor the heat island effect into their climate change monitoring and projections, and it does not explain the sharp uptick in global average temperatures, melting glaciers, record ocean warmth and more.\n\nThe bottom line: Cities are increasingly understanding the need to combat the heat island effect by adding more green space, using reflective paint on roads and buildings, opening cooling centers and more.\n\nWhat's next: NWS Portland forecasts 10 days of cooler highs, in the 80s rather than 90s, starting this weekend.", "source": {"uri": "axios.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Axios"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_falconer@axios.com", "name": "Rebecca Falconer", "type": "author",

That makes for an environment \"impervious to water, which makes good shelter, but it also absorbs a lot of the sun's radiation and heat from the sun,\" according to Julie Gabrielli, a clinical associate professor at the University of Maryland's School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.\n\n\"Then it just bakes it right back out in the air around that area,\" she added.\n\nThese heat islands are usually found across major cities, where there's a considerable amount of concrete but not a whole lot of greenery or shade, Gabrielli said. In D.C., according to the city's Department of Energy and Environment, the urban heat island effect is making some neighborhoods almost 17 degrees warmer than others.\n\nThe highest heat exposure scores, according to a D.C. Policy Center analysis last year, are in Wards 1, 5 and 6.\n\nOverall, it's not unusual for cities to be five to seven degrees warmer than their surrounding areas, according to Gabrielli.\n\nThe urban heat island effect is commonly associated with cities, but Gabrielli said it can be found across the suburbs in areas that are getting developed. In Northern Virginia, that includes Tysons and parts of Arlington.\n\n\"Taller buildings and transit-oriented development are really good in a lot of ways, because they keep us from sprawling out into further green areas in the far suburbs and it reduces people's commuting time,\" Gabrielli said. \"But if it's done in a way that does not give people places for respite for shade, if there aren't a lot of street trees or the occasional park, those areas are going to be hotter than the other neighborhoods that we're more used to thinking when we think of suburbs.\"\n\nTwo years ago, as part of its Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan, Fairfax County identified Tysons, Annandale, Chantilly, Centreville, Springfield and Herndon as areas where urban heat islands are \"particularly prevalent.\"\n\nNeighborhoods such as Annandale have land surface temperatures over 120 degrees in the hottest months of the year, the document said. Meanwhile, greener neighborhoods report land surface temperatures under 80 degrees.\n\n\"As temperatures rise for all of us, these existing Urban Heat Islands will become even hotter than they are currently, worsening health risks for these communities,\" the Fairfax County report said.\n\nMaps of heat islands, if compared to historical maps, also \"correlate with redlining and racist zoning and disinvestment. The same places that had the worst heat island effect are the most vulnerable populations and the least invested in,\" Gabrielli said.\n\nLocalities are working to address that, she said, because \"it's really a justice problem as much as it is a public health problem.\"\n\nMany people are able to tell the difference when they're in a heat island, Gabrielli said, especially if they're in an area with little or no shade.\n\nNear Springfield Town Center on Wednesday, a resident named Zenyep said she became familiar with the concept of urban heat islands through a climate justice course.\n\n\"It would make sense to call Northern Virginia a heat island,\" she said. \"I think Springfield, definitely. Whenever I'm walking even in my own neighborhood, I'm appalled at the lack of shade.\"\n\nEven those who were unfamiliar with the term weren't surprised to learn Springfield has been feeling the urban heat island effect.\n\n\"I believe you,\" a resident named Roland said. \"It's a thousand degrees today.\"\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

While severe burns are clearly a problem, do these high surface temperatures have other implications?\n\nA few days after the article on skin-burns, the Associated Press warned, \"More records expected to shatter as long-running blanket of heat threatens 130 million in U.S. (https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-record-temperatures-2ca3046bf74ca596b24a2879d8dcf664) Phoenix set a new record of 118 F, and Death Valley beat its record by 5 F.\n\nA few days after that, the AP noted record breaking heat in Las Vegas, setting an all-time record of 120 F. https://apnews.com/video/heat-waves-las-vegas-weather-national-national-ff1279056240469998be30ca8a240201\n\nClimatic warming has been attributed to heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But where does the heat come from?\n\nWhen I first went to Australia with my wife, I noticed how much things cost. Australians understood this. They know they are a small economy, a long way away, and shipping is expensive. That is all true. Because they understood the reasons for high prices, they did not seek additional evidence. They saw high-prices as unfortunate, but an acceptable cost for living in a wonderful country. I saw their acceptance as a license for high prices. Shop owners could charge whatever they wanted, and would not be challenged on price.\n\nIt is the same for greenhouse gases. Once science discovered that greenhouse gases trap heat, raising temperatures, no further cause for increasing temperatures was sought. But does the climate science discovered before greenhouse gases provide Insight?\n\nLuke Howard (1772 - 1864), an English chemist (pharmacist) was the first to document and analyze heat islands. He published \"The Climate of London: Deduced from Meteorological Observations\" in 1818, with a second volume in 1820.\n\nThe importance of the planet's surface was discovered in the 1820s when Fourier, (1768 - 1830) a French physicist and mathematician, recognized that: \"The atmosphere.... absorbs infrared radiation rising from the earth's sun-warmed surface\" (Henson, 2019:30).\n\nHoward determined that London was 1.57F warmer than surrounding areas. In urban areas today, home to over half the world's population, heat islands are typically 5F to 9F above outlying areas. However, a doctoral dissertation notes a case where temperatures were 26F higher, (Kim, JP, & Guldmann, JM, 2014). Differences of that magnitude reflect the conditions we see in these heat waves.\n\nHoward's analysis of the causes of higher urban temperatures is effectively the same as current experts. Lisa Garland (2011) lists the six causes of heat islands as:\n\nGarland lists \"Reduced evaporation\" as the primary cause of increased temperatures. Evaporation requires moisture. Howard noted: \"the country has an almost inexhaustible store of moisture to supply its evaporation - that of the city is very speedily exhausted, even after heavy rain.\" (Howard, 1820: 106).\n\nTherefore, dry environments, and anywhere drainage systems prevent rainfall from soaking into the soil, as is the case in most urban and many suburban areas, experience reduced evaporation and increased temperatures. Because most evaporation takes place as transpiration through vegetation, reducing vegetation and increasing bare soil also decreases transpiration. That condition is made worse when the soil is covered with pavement. Is It any wonder cities in arid climates like Phoenix and Las Vegas are setting new highs?\n\nThe other causes result more directly from the built environment. Increased heat storage is a function of the properties of construction materials. Increased net (heat capturing) radiation is largely a function of the proximity of buildings, and their geometric relationships. Decreased convection is a function of buildings blocking the cooling effects of air-flow. Anthropogenic heat is the thermal pollution we create, intensified in urban areas where populations are denser. Systemic interactions are the ways each of these, impact the others.\n\nHowever, the context is problematic. While measuring heat islands against surrounding areas is the generally accepted practice, it obscures reality. Certainly, suburban and rural outlying areas have more vegetation and less of the heat generating and trapping conditions of cities. But development destroys nature, reduces photosynthesis and transpiration, and increases heat generation from sunlight. To a greater or lesser extent, the entire planet has been impacted by these conditions. Where will you find \"undisturbed,\" outlying areas?\n\nThat fact has two implications. One, we have underestimated the extent of heat islands because we have no \"0\" baseline to measure against. And two, the entire planet is radiating excess heat. We have created a Heat Planet.\n\nThus, the conversion of sunlight into heat is the source that creates heat islands, and increasingly warms the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, trap that heat like a pot lid, exacerbating warming. But to reduce the elevated temperatures we are experiencing, we need to address the source of the heat generation, akin to turning down the stove.\n\nGarland, L (2011) Heat Islands: Understanding and Mitigating Heat in Urban Areas.

In Spokane Valley, Wash., the heat index could reach 104 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday before a slight dip in the following days.\n\nIn northwestern Oregon, highs of 95 to 98 degrees are forecast for the Willamette Valley. \"The average for this time of year is around 83 to 84 degrees,\" said Hannah Chandler-Cooley, a Weather Service meteorologist. \"So we are well above average. We have been above average since our heat wave early this month.\"\n\nSome areas in central and eastern Oregon could experience temperatures between 100 and 110 degrees from Saturday morning through Monday.\n\nIn Boise, Idaho, the combined heat and humidity will make it feel like the temperature is in the low 100s from Saturday through Monday. In Lewiston, Idaho, the heat index is expected to reach 100 degrees on Friday and 108 degrees on Sunday.\n\nEnvironmental factors in some parts of the Pacific Northwest contribute to making the population more susceptible to the effects of excessively hot weather.\n\nResidents in the region are generally not acclimated to high temperatures because of the historically temperate climate, though urban \"heat islands\" have begun to form with an increase in paved roads, limited shade from trees and areas where fewer houses have air conditioning. These islands can add to the disparity between residents who are adversely affected by the heat and those who are not.\n\nMany cities in Washington and Oregon have taken pre-emptive measures against the effects of another heat dome, which is created when sweltering temperatures are trapped over an area for days or even a week. In 2021, from late June through mid-July, a heat dome bore down on parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Northern California, western Nevada and British Columbia.\n\nAbout 600 more people died in Oregon and Washington during the 2021 heat dome than would have been typical for a week in late June, according a review of mortality data by The New York Times.\n\nIn King County -- Washington's most populous county, where 34 of the state's 125 deaths from the heat dome occurred -- the authorities on Thursday released a plan to address periods of sustained heat. It described the 2021 heat dome as \"the single most deadly climate disaster event in Washington State.\"\n\nThe plan stated that as the Puget Sound region, which includes King County, braces for hotter summers, the heat will not be felt equally, with low income, unhoused and other at-risk populations bearing the brunt of the effects. It proposed 20 steps to mitigate the impact of blistering heat, such as improving cooling centers, providing cool kits for people who are unhoused and assistance in tree planting.\n\nIn Oregon, the medical examiner's office in Multnomah County, which includes Portland, said it was investigating five deaths for links to the heat earlier this month, which triggered a declaration of statewide extreme heat emergency measures by Gov. Tina Kotek. A recent collapse of computer systems, unrelated to the weather, could delay some nonemergency calls, Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland, Oregon, said on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com",

A 2-year-old died in a hot car, also in Arizona. At least four people have died from heat-related illnesses in Oregon. One motorcyclist died and others were sickened riding through Death Valley as temperatures reached a record 128 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThese are some examples of the dangers of extreme heat just in the past week. As the climate grows hotter and extreme heat becomes our new normal, the summer will continue to bring reminders that high temperatures are a sinister threat.\n\nAnd hot weather has already proven even more devastating in other countries. At least 30 people in Pakistan, more than 100 people in India, and more than 125 in Mexico have died due to heat waves this year. At the annual hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, extremely hot weather played a role in the deaths of more than 1,300 people. According to the World Health Organization, heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related fatalities, and as global average temperatures rise, the risk is mounting.\n\nIt's odd then that in so many aspects of our culture, we view severe heat as something that should be willingly embraced, bravely endured, blithely ignored, or in the case of some marginalized communities, entirely deserved.\n\nOur books, movies, TV shows, common tropes, idioms, and social media often reinforce the idea that heat is something that -- with enough mental acuity -- we can overcome. But because of climate change, \"pushing through\" the heat is something we can no longer physically do. It's just simply not possible in some parts of the world as temperatures rise past the point of practical survival.\n\nWe've already passed the point at which the millions of Americans who work outdoors in the summer, or who spend significant amounts of recreational time outside, can do so safely without regular access to shade and hydration -- and increasingly even that isn't enough. Yet ironically the more we rely on air conditioning and other human-made cooling systems for relief, the more we detach ourselves from the urgency of the issue.\n\nIt doesn't help that heat itself, outside of an emergency like a wildfire, isn't an immediate problem. It sneaks up on us, gradually inducing health problems over a number of hours, during which everything may seem fine -- until it isn't.\n\nIt's worth examining our attitudes about heat: where they come from, what kinds of built-in biases they might hold, and why it's so hard to let go of the idea that failure to adapt to extreme heat is some kind of personal failing -- even in a global heating crisis.\n\nNo one has to be miserably hot, and certainly no one has to die.\n\nWe don't question the necessity of heating during the winter. Why, then, do we consider cooling during the summer a luxury? Even after the hottest year on record and likely the deadliest year for extreme heat, the policies needed to cope with hot weather are alarmingly weak in the US, if they exist at all. For instance, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the federal agency in charge of workplace safety, is only this year beginning to put together federal workplace safety standards for extreme heat despite workers around the country regularly dying on the job due to high temperatures for years.\n\nHow did we get here? The delay in developing federal protections for workers exposed to the heat might be tied to the idea that if they couldn't take it, it's because they weren't tough enough -- a literal application of \"if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen\" and a deeply embedded cultural trope.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/6698f24cb9fc170b9aaf201b/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2161406131.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746490", "eventUri": "eng-9746490", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

But, its impact on communities' health may not be as easily detected.\n\nBlack communities, in particular, are especially vulnerable to environmental hazards generated and exacerbated by climate change. According to a 2023 study from McKinsey and Company, African Americans are 1.4 times more likely than their counterparts to be exposed to extreme heat.\n\nThis not only has implications for their physical health but also their finances, as the report notes extreme heat can prevent people from attending work.\n\nIn part, the reason for this increased exposure rests in historical and systemic practices, like redlining.\n\n\"Heat and heat-related conditions impact people in different ways based on the environments in which they live. Even though redlining and segregation have been removed on paper, their legacy and practices still continue,\" said Lorece Edwards, professor of public health at Morgan State University. \"We live in concrete jungles where there is nothing but cement all around, and trust me, I have felt the heat come up from the ground under my pants leg.\"\n\nRedlining refers to the practice of denying loans, access to credit and other financial services to neighborhoods predominantly made up of minority populations. The word originates from the federal government and lenders drawing red lines on maps around neighborhoods that were considered risky investments.\n\nUrban areas -- historically targeted for redlining -- are covered in concrete and asphalt with buildings made of brick and metal, all of which absorb and retain heat. They also lack green spaces, which help to reduce heat and provide shade.\n\nRedlined communities also experience health disparities, which can be intensified by extreme heat.\n\n\"In these redlined or segregated areas, you have children with asthma, people with chronic lung diseases and people with heart disease,\" said Edwards. \"These temperatures are harder on them, and they are the ones who don't have access to transportation or the finances to put air conditioners in.\"\n\nAccording to the McKinsey and Company report, the rate of heat-related emergency department visits grew by 67 percent for African Americans compared to 27 percent for their White counterparts between 2005 and 2015. The study also revealed that extreme heat could result in the death of 60,000 people each year by 2050.\n\nSome of the more obvious outcomes of exposure to extreme heat include dehydration, heat stroke, heat rash and heat exhaustion. Maija Anderson, chair of MSU's Department of Nursing, explained that it can also aggravate cardiovascular conditions, asthma, respiratory problems and kidney function, all of which disproportionately impact Black communities.\n\nShe offered guidance for people to protect themselves from the scorching temperatures.\n\n\"Try not to play outside when it's really hot. Get your exercise in the early morning or late at night when temperatures are dropping. Try to wear light clothing,\" said Anderson. \"Hydration is really important.

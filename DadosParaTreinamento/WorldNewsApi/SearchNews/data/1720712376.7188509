Specifically, NAFDAC arraigned three persons and a company over alleged manufacturing and selling of counterfeit drugs for children before the Federal High Court in Kano. The suspects are Amao Gideon, Alumona Okwiludili, Hillary Onah Chigozie, and Giddyson Healthcare Limited. When the case came up on Friday, prosecution counsel, Oche Abutu, standing in for the Federal Government on behalf of the Attorney General of the Federation, slammed them with a five-count charge that borders on manufacturing fake drugs, being in possession, distributing, and selling of falsified medicines. However, the suspects pleaded not guilty. Their lawyer, thereafter, applied for their bail. But hearing the submissions from the prosecuting lawyer and counsel for the defendants, Justice Simon Amobeda turned down the bail request. Amobeda fixed June 14 for the bail application and June 20 for the hearing. Speaking to newsmen, the Director General of the agency, Mojisola Adeyeye, who the Kano State Coordinator represented, Kasim Ibrahim, said the syndicate has been involved in manufacturing and selling several falsified medicines, including Asian Ampicillin 125mg + Cloxacillin 125mg/5ml powder for oral suspension for children -Zero active ingredients. Others are Asian Ampicillin 125 mg/5ml powder for suspension for children active ingredient, Erythromycin 125mg/5ml powder for suspension for children \u2013 Zero active ingredient and Artil-Go (Artemether 20 mg+ Lumefantrine 120 mg/5ml) powder for suspension for children \u2013Zero active ingredients. Adeyeye noted that all the drugs were mere powders without any active ingredients required for healing or curing a patient. \u201cFor clarity, from the NAFDAC Kaduna Laboratory Services testing, there is no trace of medicine in the formulations. This puts the patient in danger of treatment failure and possible death. \u201cIn addition, the products were not registered by NAFDAC, the numbers on the products are fake, so is the manufacturer\u2019s address on the label,\u201d the NAFDAC Director General added. Prof Adeyeye disclosed that NAFDAC had sealed the illegal factory which was located in Tafa town, Tafa local Government area of Niger State. The NAFDAC boss said the illicit trade was uncovered following information and a discrete investigation that led to the arrest of the suspects. She called for the partnership of all well-meaning Nigerians and lovers of humanity in the fight against fraudsters, assuring that NAFDAC, under her leadership will maintain a zero-tolerance position on substandard and falsified medicine. \u201cWe will leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of those who chose to profit off our lives as a people because, in reality, they pose an existential threat to us and our loved ones,\u201d she said, urging Nigerians to report any suspicious product around them.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"650\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0011.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0011.jpg 650w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0011-300x277.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></div>The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, on weekend reiterated its commitment to zero-tolerance on falsified medicines after arraigning three suspects over fake drugs.&#160; Specifically, NAFDAC arraigned three persons and a company over alleged manufacturing and selling of counterfeit drugs for children before the Federal High Court&#160;in Kano.

The contract is worth up to $5 million, per the report.\n\nBefore signing with the Chargers, Chark visited LA in the week leading up to the 2024 NFL Draft. Now, they're putting pen to paper as he looks to bolster Justin Herbert's wide receiving corps with a veteran presence.\n\nLast season, Chark played 15 games for the Panthers, hauling in 15 catches for 525 yards while scoring five touchdowns.\n\nCarolina signed Chark last offseason after the wideout had spent one season with the Detroit Lions, where he ironically signed on to the Panthers with a one-year deal worth $5 million. He landed that contract after earning a one-year, $10 million deal with Detroit.\n\nChark hasn't been a journeyman for his entire career, though. He spent four seasons, or his entire rookie contract, with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was selected No. 61 overall in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Jags.\n\nHe exploded onto the scene in 2019 after a quiet rookie season. Playing in 15 games that season, Chark logged career-high numbers that still last almost five seasons later having hauled in 73 receptions on 118 targets for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns. He earned a Pro Bowl nod that season for his efforts. He put together another strong season in 2020 having gone for 706 receiving yards and five touchdowns, but would never see the same production to this point in his career.\n\nInjuries have been a big obstacle for Chark since joining the professional ranks, as the wideout has yet to play in a full slate of games in a season. After playing in four games during an injury-plagued 2021, Chark played in 11 contests for the Lions in 2022, starting 10.\n\nThrough six seasons in the NFL, Chark has compiled 212 receptions for 3,069 yards and 23 receptions across 69 appearances. If he can maintain his health, he provides the Chargers with instant play-making abilities with a knack for finding the end zone having scored eight touchdowns over the past two seasons despite his injuries.\n\nWith a new lease on life under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh, the Chargers have a lot to be excited about this offseason, and adding Chark to the mix is a welcome addition for those running the show in LA.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barkley_truax@on3.com", "name": "Barkley Truax", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/02212320/DJ-Chark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535222", "eventUri": "eng-9535222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Chark.\n\nAccording to NFL.com, the Chargers have agreed to terms on a one-year contract with the former Pro Bowl receiver. The deal is worth up to a total of $5 million if Chark meets every incentive. Although Chark is only 27, he instantly becomes the most experienced receiver on a Chargers roster that's definitely lacking experience at the position.\n\nD.J. Chark CAR * WR * #17 View Profile\n\nThe Chargers have completely overhauled their receiving room this offseason. The overhaul started in March when the team decided to cut Mike Williams, who had been with the Chargers since 2017. The team also decided to get rid of Keenan Allen, who was traded to the Bears shortly after Williams was released. Allen had spent his entire 11-year career with the Chargers and he left Los Angeles as the second-leading receiver in franchise history in both yards and receptions.\n\nWith those two out, the Chargers had some big holes to fill and they started that process in the draft by selecting Ladd McConkey with the 34th overall pick before adding two more receivers in the seventh round (Brenden Rice and Cornelius Johnson). Clearly, the Chargers felt like they still needed to do more, which would explain why they decided to add Chark, who's going into his seventh NFL season.\n\nThanks to this move, Chark will now be playing for his fourth team in four years. He spent the 2023 season in Carolina, where he finished second on the team in receiving yards with 525 while playing for a Panthers offense that struggled for most of the year. In 2022, he was in Detroit, where he finished with 502 receiving yards, which ranked third on the team.\n\nBefore his time with the Lions, Chark spent the first four seasons of his career in Jacksonville (2018-21). His best season came in 2019 when he was voted to the Pro Bowl after leading the team with 73 receptions for 1,008 yards. Chark has averaged 39.6 catches for 579 yards and 4.6 touchdowns over his past five seasons and if he can hit those numbers in L.A., the Chargers would probably be thrilled.\n\nChark will now be joining a receiving room that already includes Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer and Derius Davis on top of the three aformentioned rookies.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_breech@cbssports.com", "name": "John Breech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Chark", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "D.

Chark is now off the table for the Pittsburgh Steelers in free agency as he heads to the Los Angeles Chargers on a one year deal.\n\nFree agent wide receiver D.J. Chark thought the Pittsburgh Steelers were going to pick him in the 2018 NFL Draft, and they had another shot at him, but he is going to the Los Angeles Chargers on a one-year contract worth up to $5 million. That's not a hefty contract or off projections, but it takes a key outside X-receiver off the market for Pittsburgh.\n\nAppearing in an episode of the Punch Line Podcast with Baltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey, Chark said that he thought he might end up in Pittsburgh in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft. It won't happen this time either.\n\nThe Steelers had pick No. 60 with Chark on the board in the second round, and needed a wide receiver. Instead, they ended up taking Oklahoma State wide receiver James Washington. Chark ended up going one pick later to the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\"I had an idea, I said maybe I'd go to Pittsburgh. They actually picked before me. The pick before I got picked to Jacksonville, they picked James Washington. So when it was coming up, I was like okay, I had a good relationship with them, talking to them. My phone rang, and I thought it was them, but I saw the 904. I was like, alright, that's cool, too.\"\n\nNow, Chark could end up with the team he nearly thought he'd be drafted by. One of the top free agents remaining on the market, the 27-year-old Chark could have been a fit for the Steelers, who have a vacancy at wide receiver and have recently been connected to top trade targets like Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel.\n\nChark spent his first four seasons in Jacksonville, and had his career-best year there in 2019, when he caught 73 passes for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns. He ashen't been able to replicate that level of production since. After a slight downturn in 2020, a broken ankle sank his 2021 season and he left Jacksonville in free agency.\n\nChark signed a pair of one-year deals in 2022 and 2023, first with the Detroit Lions, where he caught 30 passes for 502 yards and three touchdowns in 2022 and then with the Carolina Panthers, where he caught 35 passes for 525 yards and five scores last season.\n\nChark's last deal with the Panthers was a one-year offering for $5 million. He got virtually the same deal with Los Angeles.

add Rome Odunze or Malik Nabers with the No. 5 pick in the NFL Draft - choosing instead to add offensive tackle Joe Alt.\n\nBut it brought in six-year receiver DJ Chark on a one-year deal to give Justin Herbert an experienced target.\n\nUntil his signing, the Chargers had no wideout with more than three years in the NFL or a season with over 800 yards.\n\nChark, 27, last played for the Carolina Panthers and had 525 yards and five touchdowns on 35 catches but did not do enough to earn a stay.\n\nThe 6ft 4in wideout has struggled with injuries for five years.\n\nHis best season so far came with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019, where he managed 73 receptions for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nThat saw him make the Pro Bowl for the first and only time in his career.\n\nChark will join former Carolina teammates Hayden Hurst and Bradley Bozeman in LA.\n\nJoshua Palmer and Quentin Johnston have remained with the team and will compete with Chark for snaps.\n\nThe Chargers

April 11.\n\nHis funeral coincided with Day 3 of the Draft, per NFL insider Ian Rapoport.\n\nRapoport reported that Rice, 22, was present at Miller's funeral.\n\nThe new Chargers wide receiver is said to have boarded a plane to Dallas, Texas, early Saturday morning so he could say a last goodbye.\n\nEx-USC standout rice served as a pallbearer during the ceremony and gave an obituary speech,

Chark to a one-year deal this week, giving the team more credibility in the receiver room.\n\nHighlights The Los Angeles Chargers hired Jim Harbaugh as head coach, but have been struggling to support QB Justin Herbert. The Chargers bolstered their receiving corps by signing D.J. Chark and drafting Georgia alum Ladd McConkey. The team aims to revamp their rushing attack under Harbaugh & OC Greg Roman, taking some pressure off Herbert.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers made one of the biggest moves of the offseason before free agency even started, hiring former Michigan Wolverines' coach Jim Harbaugh as their new head coach to pair with franchise quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nFor all the hype around that pairing, the Chargers haven't been doing much to support Herbert this offseason. Los Angeles has shedded their top two receivers - Mike Williams and Keenan Allen - for salary cap reasons, and running back Austin Ekeler left in free agency for the Washington Commanders.\n\nThe team did sign running back J.K. Dobbins as well as Gus Edwards as a short-term replacement for Ekeler, but they've spent the past few months in desperate need of a wide receiver. While armed with the fifth overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, the Chargers elected to take offensive tackle Joe Alt instead of drafting one of Malik Nabers or Rome Odunze.\n\nHowever, the team did trade up in Round 2 for Georgia wide receiver Ladd McConkey, who should step into a starting role on the offense on the first day of training camp. And now, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the team is signing veteran receiver D.J. Chark to a one-year, $5 million deal.\n\nThough lacking relative to the top-end weapons they've employed in years past, the Chargers are slowly but surely building a respectable receiving corps around Herbert.\n\nRelated Los Angeles Chargers Trade up for Ladd McConkey How Ladd McConkey fits in with the new look Los Angeles Chargers. Chark's Signing Will Push Former 1st Round WR Down Depth Chart Quentin Johnston had a disastrous rookie year in 2023\n\nIt's safe to say that Los Angeles' offense will look quite different this year under Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who has long had success running the ball wherever he goes.\n\nLos Angeles hasn't had a prolific rushing attack in quite some time. Over the last three seasons, the Chargers have never ranked higher than 21st in the league in rushing yards per game.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum exists Roman. The San Francisco 49ers ran for more yards than all but one team during Harbaugh and Roman's tenure from 2011-2014. Roman also called more run plays than anyone during his four-year stint with the Baltimore Ravens (2019-2022).\n\nHarbaugh & Roman 49ers' Rush Offense, 2011-2014\n\nCategory\n\n49ers\n\nRank\n\nRush Yards\n\n8,912\n\n2nd\n\nRush Attempts\n\n1,965\n\n3rd\n\nYards/Attempt\n\n4.5\n\nT-6th\n\nRush TDs\n\n59\n\nT-6th\n\nNevertheless, Herbert is the team's quarterback, and the Chargers aren't going to save his rocket right arm for emergencies. Something had to be done about the WR room after Allen and Williams' departures, and Chark represents a nice stopgag option for a team as desperate as the Chargers.\n\nWhile Chark will presumably step into an outside receiver role opposite incumbent WR1 Joshua Palmer (a role he's earned more by default than ability), the Chargers' rookie receiver will also have an important role in the offense.\n\nAt Georgia, McConkey lined up on the outside 70.3% of the time, though he's plenty capable of playing the slot. He also proved adept at fighting press coverage despite his 5'11\", 186-pound frame. Throw in a 4.39 40-yard dash, and it's clear why the Chargers traded up for the two-time National Champion.\n\nStill, McConkey's most productive season in college amounted to 762 receiving yards to go with seven touchdowns in 15 games. Injuries like turf toe, knee tendinitis, and an ankle sprain forced him to miss time. He isn't a sure thing to be the next elite rookie wideout, making Chark's signing all the more necessary.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: If nothing else, Chark adds some much-needed verticality to L.A.'s offense. In 2022 with Detroit, Chark posted 11 receptions for 15+ yards (tied for 13th) and 17.6 yards per reception (11th). In 2023 with Carolina, he averaged 15.0 yards per reception (21st), with nine catches going for 20 or more yards.\n\nAs a result of Chark's signing, 2023 first-round pick Quentin Johnston will all but certainly be relegated to the bench, at least to open up the 2024 season. The TCU alum appeared in all 17 games in his rookie season, and yet, despite the fact that both Williams and Allen missed time because of injury, he only caught 38 passes for 431 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nJohnston didn't rank among the top-ten in any notable receiving category among rookies last year, and he'll have to make rapid improvements to garner meaningful snaps in Harbaugh's demanding scheme. His 6'4\", 215 pound frame portends good run-blocking ability, but Johnston hasn't been asked to do much of it before - it could be his ticket onto the field if he proves proficient at it.\n\nThere's still work to do for Los Angeles ahead of training camp, but they've made big strides in filling out the roster with players who fit in Harbaugh's system. Chark isn't a long-term option after playing for three teams over the past three seasons (the Chargers will be his fourth), but he does add speed and downfield ability to a team that was sorely lacking it.\n\nSource: Ian Rapoport\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference and all salary info courtesy of Spotrac unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated Joe Alt Selected No. 5 Overall by Los

LA has made another key NFL free agency signing with a former Jared Goff weapon. Ex-Detroit Lions-turned-Carolina Panthers wide receiver DJ Chark Jr. is joining the team on a new deal.\n\nLos Angeles and Chark have agreed to terms on a one-year deal worth up to $5 million, per Ian Rapoport. Chark visited LA before the 2024 NFL Draft and now has an opportunity to play with the team.\n\nDJ Chark started his professional career with the Jacksonville Jaguars when the team selected him with the 61st pick in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft. Chark's rookie year set him up for an incredible leap during his second season. He amassed a career-high 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns in 2019-20.\n\nHe followed the stellar year with 706 yards and five TDS in 2020-21. However, Clark experienced a drop in production during his last year with the Jaguars after playing just four games. He then joined the Detroit Lions in 2022, where he worked alongside coveted QB Jared Goff.\n\nClark totaled 502 yards and three TDs in 11 games with Detroit. He landed another opportunity with the Panthers a year later. The 27-year-old comes off a year of 525 yards and five TDs.\n\nDJ Chark should be able to mesh well with Justin Herbert after getting experience alongside Jared Goff on the Lions. Herbert only played 13 games in 2023-24 but was still one of the most serviceable QBs in the NFL. He amassed 3,134 yards and 20 TDs.\n\nHerbert headlines a revamped LA squad that looks to take a jump in 2024-25.\n\nChargers players and new leadership should bode well in 2024-25\n\nOne of Los Angeles' biggest moves of the offseason was hiring former Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh. Harbaugh joined the Chargers fresh off a national championship with the Wolverines. His experience should help Los Angeles get over the hump.\n\nHarbaugh brought great energy from the first day and displayed his excitement to work with Chargers' roster.\n\n\"The pros on this team, Justin Herbert, you see he's a crown jewel in the NFL. Derwin James, there's another one. You talk about someone getting me fired up...We got guys,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nHe praised the Chargers for their work ethic and noted how hungry they were to win. Furthermore, Harbaugh made a pivotal move that will help the roster ascend to greater heights. He brought in former Michigan strength coach Ben Herbert.\n\nHerbert is a renowned staff member with a demonstrated history of helping teams get the best out of their players.

Many fans likely gasped when the team chose to take Notre Dame offensive tackle Joe Alt with the No. 5 overall pick in the draft ahead of wide receivers Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze.\n\nBut the team didn't wait much longer to address the position, using its second-round pick on Ladd McConkey before taking a pair of receivers -- Brended Rice and Cornelius Johnson -- in the seventh round.\n\nFollowing the draft, the Chargers then went out and added a proven veteran by signing D.J. Chark, who most recently played for the Carolina Panthers. With all of these moves, it now gives us a chance to see how the wide receiver position for the Chargers currently looks. Of course, this may not be the same way it looks at the end of the summer when the season is set to kick off.\n\nThe Chargers have 11 receivers currently on the roster which will make it an interesting position to keep tabs on in camp and preseason games. There is really nothing set in stone on this depth chart.\n\nBoth Johnston and Palmer could easily get pushed for playing time. Davis is one to watch and Fehoko lands on the second-string line only because of experience. Rookies Rice and Johnson could easily overtake him and at least one of them should make the team.\n\nGill, Johnson and Johnson III are all undrafted free agents and will be fighting for the last roster spot or a place on the team's practice squad.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Williams_(wide_receiver,_born_1994)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Williams (wide receiver, born 1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladd_McConkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ladd McConkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Chark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

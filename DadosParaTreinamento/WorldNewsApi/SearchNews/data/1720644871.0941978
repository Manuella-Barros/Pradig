{"id": 231292694, "title": "It\u2019s Time to Establish the Second-Greatest Generation", "text": "Americans born between 1901 and 1924 (give or take a couple of years, depending on the source) are collectively referred to as the Greatest Generation, because of the sacrifices they made for good of country. They risked life and limb to battle Hitler\u2019s Germany, Mussolini\u2019s Italy, and Hirohito\u2019s Japan and thereby save the world for democracy. Many considered that the pinnacle of selflessness, thus dubbing them the greatest generation of all. America is currently facing another threat: our alarmingly porous Southern border. It\u2019s a bona fide crisis that erodes not only our national culture, but our security and overall quality of life. That\u2019s why we need another nationwide movement of selfless sacrifice, placing country ahead of self. However, because what we\u2019d risk this time around pales in comparison to the challenges met and conquered by our World War II-era counterparts, I suggest we label ourselves, if successful in our undertaking, merely the second-greatest generation. Donald Trump speaks about mass deportations in a second term, causing hysteria not only among social justice warriors, who champion the plight of transnational trespassers, but also the Wall Street Journal crowd, who\u2019s bottom line is maximum profit at almost any cost. That so many who don\u2019t take Trump seriously take him literally never fails to amuse. But I tend to be an optimist, so here\u2019s to hoping Trump actually follows through on his mass deportations promise and it doesn\u2019t turn out to be just a campaign bloviation. One of the Journal\u2019s longstanding columnists, William Galston, worries that if Trump truly deports thousands upon thousands of PHIs (Persons Here Illegally), it will hurt the economy, because the American-born college kid waiting tables in a restaurant won\u2019t have any food to serve, since no one will be in the kitchen to do the gruntwork (\u2018Mass Deportations Would Be a Disaster\u2019, Wall Street Journal, May 29). Galston epitomizes the conventional \u2013 and flawed \u2013 theory of would-be cultural anthropologists, who insist that no person born on U.S. soil will mop floors, lay bricks, or pick oranges. But they ignore the timeless principles of supply and demand: the better working conditions are, the more people will want to work. To illustrate, let\u2019s consider the fictitious George, a Greek-American diner owner. Along with the Americans George employs on the books, he pays three Central American PHIs \u2013 Diego, Juan, and Osvaldo \u2013 off the books. Then, suddenly, due to Trump\u2019s policies, George\u2019s PHI trio is deported, and there\u2019s no one sling hash and wash the dishes. George puts out the feelers to recruit more PHIs, but they\u2019re all gone. Swept away by Trump\u2019s newly created Army subdivision called the Repatriation Regiment. George tries local colleges, hoping some undergrads in search of beer money for the weekend would be willing to put in a few hours. No such luck. These kids can\u2019t play games or surf social media on their phones while their hands are in dishwater \u2013 so they\u2019ll just sponge off of mom and dad. Sure, there\u2019s the undereducated single mom who needs to pay the bills, but she can make more driving an Uber than being subjected to the abusive language of a megalomaniacal male sole proprietor. And even if George bucks that trend and is a kindly and respectful boss, the reputation in the industry is such that few with other choices want the job. That\u2019s why Help Wanted signs in restaurants nowadays are as commonplace as the silverware. George finally realizes he can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. He substantially increases the wages for dishwashers and short order cooks. He even provides plans to assist with college tuition. His disposition becomes sweet. He\u2019s sympathetic to his employees\u2019 needs, and is generous in feeding them well. In fact, he gives large discounts to their entire families when they dine there. All of that deeply cuts into George\u2019s profits. To make ends meet, he sells his boat. He trades in his Mercedes for a Kia. He doesn\u2019t take his family to Greece every year anymore. He buys a flip phone instead of a smartphone. He gives up satellite TV. And he doesn\u2019t take the kids to Disney World; they can watch Mickey Mouse at home on TV. Even with all those sacrifices, George still has to raise prices at the diner to offset the overhead he endures by paying Diego\u2019s, Juan\u2019s, and Osvaldo\u2019s American-born successors so much more. Those price increases affect Mary, who lives in the neighborhood and has been a regular at George\u2019s diner for years. Mary can no longer afford to eat at George\u2019s four days a week; she cuts it to one day a week and skips breakfast the other days, bringing a protein shake to work instead. To Americans who think all of that is giving up a lot, I suggest a trip to their progenitors\u2019 native homeland \u2013 whether that be Greece, the Philippines, or Puerto Rico. Because whenever I go to Greece and experience what food is really supposed to taste like (where the French fries need no ketchup and the shrimp need no cocktail sauce), swim in waters too beautiful to describe with mere words, and marvel at the simplicity of small islands whose magic hasn\u2019t yet been tainted by technology, I realize that America\u2019s pleasures are mostly rooted in decadence: a thousand channels, sprawling supermarkets, and toy drones. On second thought, maybe George\u2019s and Mary\u2019s sacrifices aren\u2019t that big at all. Certainly not when considering what they \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 would regain in return: a country. A true country. Because, like him or not, when Trump says \u201cif we don\u2019t have borders, we don\u2019t have a country,\u201d he\u2019s 100 percent right.", "summary": "<p>Americans born between 1901 and 1924 (give or take a couple of years, depending on the source) are collectively referred&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/its-time-to-establish-the-second-greatest-generation/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">It\u2019s Time to Establish the Second-Greatest Generation</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/its-time-to-establish-the-second-greatest-generation/\">It\u2019s Time to Establish the Second-Greatest Generation</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com\">The National Herald</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/its-time-to-establish-the-second-greatest-generation/", "image": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24134708290186-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:58:49", "author": "Achilleas Kouremenos", "authors": ["Achilleas Kouremenos"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.035}

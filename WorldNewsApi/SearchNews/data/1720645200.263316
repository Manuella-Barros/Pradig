{"id": 231359748, "title": "Exact date 'major' Greenland storm set for UK as weather maps show where it will hit first", "text": "According to the latest meteorological reports, the UK stands on the brink of experiencing intense rainfall later this month, with estimates suggesting up to 3mm per hour in some areas. A storm originating from Greenland appears imminent and is predicted to crash into the UK as early as Thursday June 20, around 4am. The weather maps forecast a journey for the storm from the farthest north-west corner of Scotland down through England and out towards France. It is predicted to hit the UK and exit in a 24-hour window. The stormy conditions are anticipated to advance towards the Atlantic Ocean on the morning of Wednesday June 19, carrying along the peculiar meteorological event of 'freezing rain'. Freezing rain occurs when the layer of freezing air is so thin that the raindrops do not have enough time to freeze before reaching the ground. Instead, the water freezes on contact with the surface, creating a coating of ice on whatever the raindrops contact.

It is predicted that the storm will make landfall near Glasgow at around 4am on that day. Weather maps show it could be Liverpool which received the heaviest volume of rain, especially at around 4pm. It is predicted the storm will move southeast across the UK, reaching London and Kent by about 7pm. The Met Office's long-range forecast spans from Thursday June 13 to Saturday June 22. It predicts: \"After a dry start for many on Thursday, a band of rain is expected to push eastwards to affect much of the country. It will feel cool and damp for many, especially across hills in southern and central areas. \"On Friday and over the weekend, the weather will likely become a mix of sunshine and showers. During the daytime on each day, showers could become heavy and slow moving, and there is a chance these might turn thundery at times. However, not everywhere will catch a shower, and many places may hold on to warm, sunny days with light winds. Next week, confidence for dominant weather regimes is low. There are tentative signs of building high pressure from the west, but rain and showers are still possible.\"", "summary": "A powerful 'major' storm is expected to hit the UK later this month, with up to 3mm of rain per hour, according to the latest weather maps", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/exact-date-major-greenland-storm-29319443", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29319373.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_britain-forecast-to-endure-terrifying-greenland-storm-with-weather-maps-turning-showing-major-downpo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:20:22", "author": "Katy Hallam", "authors": ["Katy Hallam"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.288}

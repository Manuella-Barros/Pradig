Railway officials said such incidents have been on the rise in the three day since the GRP issued the letter, citing an old order.\n\nThe GRP letter to station masters dated August 14, a copy of which is with mid-day, says the task of shifting injured victims to hospitals should be done by the Railway Protection Force at respective stations and the GRP should be informed of it once the victim is shifted.\n\nThe letter cities the 'RPF Standing Orders' dated April 1998, with the subject \"Arranging medical help to railway passengers\".\n\nPoint 4 of the order says the RPF should take personal responsibility to shift injured victims to hospital and then inform the Government Railway Police.\n\n\"There is a tendency to refer such cases to the GRP first who might insist on written complaints before attending to the injured persons. It is often forgotten that immediate medical aid to the injured must be our upper-most priority,\" the standing order clarifies.\n\nIt, however, adds that any railway functionary or any citizen, on humanitarian considerations, rush the injured passengers to the nearest hospital.\n\nWhile GRP Commissioner Niket Kaushik did not respond to calls, officials from his team strongly refuted the point that there was a delay on Friday due to them.\n\n\"GRP officials have always been prompt and helpful while dealing with victims. It is unfair to allege that delays happened because of the GRP procedures,\" the official said.\n\nSenior Divisional Security Commissioner of RPF with Mumbai division of Central Railway Sachin Bhalode said the issue of shifting of injured victims should not arise in first place.\n\n\"The order says it is the moral duty of all citizens to help the injured, not just people in uniform. Help in the Golden Hour is the most crucial thing. The Railway Protection Force is always there to do all the necessary things and help out victims and passengers in all instances.\"\n\nThane railway senior police inspector Uttam Sonawane, who is also the letter issuing authority for Thane zone, said there was no delay in shifting the victim at Thane on Friday morning.\n\n\"As per the new orders, we tried to get RPF for help but after they refused saying they do not have any orders from their superiors, we took charge of the case and shifted the victim immediately without any time loss,\" he said. \"There have been such instances of bickering recently since the new GRP letter as we have been asking RPF teams to help out, but they have been persistently refusing. However, we have given strict warning to our team that the victims must not suffer and that there must not be any delay while shifting them.\"\n\nRailway activist Bhawesh Patel said that the GRP letter has been issued due to misinterpretation of the standing orders. \"How can any government body issue such a letter? The standing orders already mention that all citizens should be acting promptly in such cases on humanitarian grounds. The allegation that GRP wastes time in paperwork in the standing order is also incorrect. I have myself shifted more than 500 railway victims with the help of GRP and there were never any issues,\" he said.\n\nTrending Videos\n\nWatch Video: A Dangerous Phenomenon: The Blue Whale Suicide Challenge !\n\nDownload the new mid-day android app to get updates on all the latest and trending stories on the go https://goo.gl/8Xlcvr", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:33:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1110, "textStart": 1101, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-14", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1396, "textStart": 1386, "date": "1998-04-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.886274516582489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375051", "time": "03:33:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375051", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "51595", "label": {"eng": "Th\u0101ne"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Th\u0101ne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "55019", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "score": 3}, {"id": "340770", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "score": 5}, {"id": "392289", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Central Railway zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Railway_zone", "score": 2}, {"id": "470128", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Railroad police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_police", "score": 5}, {"id": "489169", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Railway Protection Force"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Protection_Force", "score": 5}, {"id": "555879", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Thane railway station"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane_railway_station", "score": 3}, {"id": "700280", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sunil Pal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Pal", "score": 3}], "image": "http://images.mid-day.com/images/2017/aug/Dead-body-l.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:33:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Thane: Man left bleeding on tracks as GRP-RPF fight over who should tend to him - News", "originalArticle": null}

The GRP took aggressively to twitter to announce this and said it was re-drafting processes, on the handling of accident victims, with the help of the railway administration so that such incidents did not recur.\n\nDenying any delay on its part, the GRP stated that attending to the injured has always been their priority and that orders in this regard were absolutely clear. \"Any agency that finds an injured person must immediately transfer him to the nearest hospital. Reporting to the GRP and the subsequent enquiry/paper work should follow in due course.\n\nWhile the Railways' Additional Director General Jai Jeet Singh did not respond to calls, the GRP clarified on Twitter, saying, \"The injured man at Thane was taken to the stationmaster's room, who, instead of calling an ambulance wasted precious time making announcements to call GRP. Why is the GRP needed to send an injured person to hospital?\"\n\nThough it was eventually the GRP who shifted Sunil Pal, 21, to hospital, they said they had tried to get in touch with the RPF, but got no assistance.\n\nRailway activist Bhawesh Patel, who has been following up the issue of who takes a rail accident victim to hospital, said he would be taking up the matter with the GRP.\n\nMumbai has a very high track death rate with an average of 10 people dying every day in rail accidents.

The decision was taken recently at a joint meeting of senior GRP and RPF officials and inspectors.\n\nPresently, there are nearly 2,100 RPF staff in Central Railway and nearly 1,200 in Western Railway. Similarly, there are 3,500 GRP staff in the Mumbai division.\n\nSenior GRP officials said the issue had been under discussion for a while with the Railway Ministry and the Railway Board. An official said, \"RPF and GRP are both facing a shortage of staff. Both forces have staff deployed at the same location. By joining hands we can better utilise our resources and deploy officers evenly across important locations. This move will resolve issues cropping out due to staff crunch, such as lack of communication hindering the progress of cases.\"\n\nInformation related to security arrangements will be shared between both the forces and they will have knowledge of the number of staff deployed at various stations and their locations. Sachin Bhalode, Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Central Railway, said, \"The RPF will give the details of our staff deployment to the GRP and vice-versa. This will make our work much easier from now on.\"\n\nFollowing a review of security equipment on railway premises, authorities issued a letter instructing all CCTV cameras to be repaired to ensure security at railway stations. A.K. Gupta, general manager, Western Railway, said, \"We are now relocating CCTV cameras to areas that lack adequate surveillance.\" Senior staff have been instructed at their respective railway stations a list of the safety equipment they need such as hand-held detectors, door frame metal detectors and CCTV cameras.\n\nAn official said that there is a plan to install 161 new CCTV cameras at Andheri station, which is covered now surveilled by 32 cameras. A GRP official said, \"Andheri station officials have raised a demand to relocate existing CCTV cameras and to install more cameras to ensure fool-proof security at the station.

Currently, at least 650 trains, including Rajdhanis, Shatabdis and Jan Shatabdis, are running in the Delhi division of Northern Railway.\n\nThe recent incident of thefts in the Mumbai-Delhi August Kranti Express has once again brought the issue of security of train commuters into the limelight after at least 10 passengers were allegedly robbed of goods worth several lakhs. Railway officials have said that while 100 more trains in the Delhi division are being escorted over the past two years, it is not enough.\n\n\"We are planning to increase the number, keeping in light recent security incidents. Vulnarable routes and trains have been mapped and security on these has been increased. We may also add CCTV cameras on certain trains,\" said R N Singh, divisional railway manager (DRM), Delhi division. While 81 trains are escorted by RPF, 219 are guarded by GRP.\n\nOfficials say the number of security personnel onboard these trains also varies. While RPF usually posts four personnel on each train; for GRP, the number varies from two to 10. RPF officials, however, provide additional protection through stations.\n\n\"It is difficult for four personnel to cover all 24 coaches. We try to coordinate through personnel at stations, but thieves often strike at night when a train stops at a station and they can quickly get inside, pick an unattended bag and leave,\" said a senior official.\n\nTo fight this trend, the number of patrolling personnel may be increased at stations. \"RPF personnel target offenders under the Railway Act while the crimes under Indian Penal Code are tackled by GRP. However, to provide security to passengers, RPF personnel also take action on trains and, in most cases, apprehend passengers and hand them over to GRP for legal action,\" said a senior railway official. Officials say vulnerable stretches have now been identified with 300 RPF personnel patrolling the area over the past one year.\n\nNorthern Railway is now planning to install additional CCTV cameras and bring at least 20 more stations under CCTV surveillance with the help of the Nirbhaya funds.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:33:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375051", "time": "19:33:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375051", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "52726", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "54715", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "55019", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "306100", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "score": 3}, {"id": "306793", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "score": 3}, {"id": "314551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "score": 2}, {"id": "318054", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "score": 3}, {"id": "327785", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "score": 2}, {"id": "340770", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "score": 5}, {"id": "418565", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rajadhani Express"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajdhani_Express", "score": 3}, {"id": "470128", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Railroad police"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_police", "score": 4}, {"id": "489169", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Railway Protection Force"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Protection_Force", "score": 4}, {"id": "551681", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Northern Railway zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Railway_zone", "score": 3}, {"id": "1037710", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Delhi Territory"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Territory", "score": 5}], "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:33:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Northern rail plans more staff for train security - Times of India", "originalArticle": null}

But when she clocked 12.48 seconds in the London Diamond League last month - her fastest time for five years - she realised she was in medal-contending form.\n\nShe then underlined that by reaching the final as the fastest qualifier in 12.53 on Friday.\n\nPearson did not need to go that fast yesterday but barely noticed the clock as she posted 12.59 seconds, screaming \"oh my God\" repeatedly after crossing the line.\n\n\"I've worked so hard, I don't know what has just happened out there. I'm so tired but I'm sure it will sink in soon,\" she said.\n\nOn her joyous finish-line exclamations, she said: \"I don't know if it was surprise but the emotion just escaped my body because I was so excited and so happy to have achieved what I've worked so hard for.\n\n\"I love this stadium, I love the people and I'm so happy to be back here doing the same thing again.\"\n\nHarper Nelson, the 2008 Olympic champion and silver medallist behind Pearson in 2012 took silver in 12.63 ahead of Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz, who claimed a surprise bronze in 12.72. \"I cannot believe it, it's crazy,\" said Dutkiewicz. \"There were so many big names in the field and since I was a girl I have been admiring Sally Pearson.\n\n\"This is like in a film. I had a flow. I am glad I caught this moment of complete flow, of complete concentration. On the finish line I thought I had finished fourth - madness!\"\n\nFavourite Kendra Harrison, who set the world record in the London Stadium last year having missed out on Olympic selection, clattered too many barriers as she did in the semis and finished fourth in 12.74.\n\nPearson, racing in lane three outside Harrison, blasted from the blocks and showed all her experience to concentrate on her own race as Harrison faltered.\n\nFormer men's 110m hurdles world record holder Colin Jackson described the Australian's technique as \"absolutely flawless\" and that, combined with her famed winning mentality and now a body again able to match her mind, took her over the line.\n\nHarrison, who was disqualified in the semis two years ago, had been unbeaten in 23 races until the semi-final in London on Friday but her wait for a championship medal goes on.\n\n\"I'm still young, this was my first world final, people forget that because I'm the world record holder,\" said the 24-year-old.\n\n\"They expect me to be winning all the time but I'm pleased to be in my first world final and have learned a lot.\"\n\nDefending champion Danielle Williams of Jamaica failed to make the final while last year's Olympic champion Brianna Rollins, who led an American sweep of the Rio podium, is banned for a doping violation. -- Reuters", "timeCrawl": "00:59:00", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 133, "amb": false, "textEnd": 148}, {"textStart": 172, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 178}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8859488", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "id": 256, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

100m hurdles at the world athletics championships.\n\nCompeting at her first major global championship since 2013 and having overcome serious wrist, hamstring and achilles injuries, Pearson powered away from the field on Saturday to win in 12.59 seconds.\n\nHer long-time rival Dawn Harper-Nelson from the United States was second in 12.63 and Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz claimed the bronze in 12.72.\n\nWorld record holder Kendra Harrison from the US finished out of the medals in fourth place.\n\n\"That was bloody hard,\" an emotional Pearson said shortly after crossing the finish line. \"I've worked so hard, I don't know what has just happened out there.\n\n\"I'm so tired but I'm sure it will sink in soon.\n\n\"It's been a long journey back from injury, but to get this moment and go and celebrate in front of my family is unreal.\"\n\nIt was a third major 100m hurdles title for Pearson, who had previously won gold at the 2011 world championships in Daegu and the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nThe 30-year-old joined 400m runner Cathy Freeman and 400m hurdler Jana Pittman as the only Australians to have won two world track and field titles.\n\nHer next challenge will be winning a third successive Commonwealth title on home soil on the Gold Coast next year.\n\nAfter injury denied Pearson of the opportunity to defend her Olympic crown last year in Rio, she decided to coach herself.\n\nIt proved to be masterstroke.\n\nShe assumed favouritism for the world title by clocking the fastest semi-final time of 12.53 on Friday evening and carried that dominance into the final.\n\n\"I don't know if it was surprise or what, but the emotion just escaped my body because I was so excited and so happy to have achieved what I have worked so hard for,\" Pearson said.\n\n\"I love this stadium, I love the people and I'm so happy to have been back here doing the same thing again [winning gold].\"\n\nIt was the latest instalment of the great rivalry between Pearson and Harper-Nelson, with the American having relegated the Australian into second spot at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, only for Pearson to reverse that result four years later in London.\n\n\"Me and Sally have just battled it out for years and it's been so great to be here with her,\" said 33-year-old Harper. \"Silver tastes like gold tonight.\n\n\"I am really excited to come out of this with a medal

I was so tired. That was just incredible. I feel like I am back in Beijing in 2008, not coming in as one of the favourites.''\n\nPearson gave a similarly bubbly interview in 2008, when she surprised the field to win her first Olympic medal, silver behind Harper-Nelson.\n\nPearson had qualified fastest for the final after putting together an exceptional semi-final, recording the fastest time of the championships, 12.53sec.\n\nBy contrast Harrison, who had won 23 straight races coming into the championships, had had a near-disaster which sapped her confidence.\n\nClearly nervous, she smashed into the first hurdle in her semi-final and was almost eliminated. She made a remarkable recovery to regain ground on the field over the other nine barriers and grab third place and the final spot in the final.\n\nPearson watched open-mouthed in the mixed zone as the only woman in the field who has run faster than her was almost eliminated.\n\nBut her response to the drama surrounding Harrison was instructive.\n\nWhen Harrison's place in the final was confirmed, her first thought was \"it doesn't matter''.\n\n\"Tomorrow is another day and I just have to make sure I'm the fastest one out there.''\n\nAnd she was.\n\nPearson has been the best competitor of her generation in the 100m hurdles.\n\nShe won her first world title in 2011, setting a championships record of 12.28sec which still stands, and won her Olympic gold medal in 2012 in the London stadium.\n\nShe missed the 2015 world titles after smashing her wrist in a race fall and was ruled out of last year's Rio Olympics due a hamstring injury, but with a return to full health and having decided to coach herself she has re-emerged as a champion this year.", "timeCrawl": "21:23:00", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8845307", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "id": 96, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "id": 256, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World_Building", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World Building", "id": 766, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "id": 1080, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

After she won her Olympic gold medal she felt relief. But after coming back from four years of injuries to win her second world title in London today, her overwhelming emotion is pride.\n\n\"Every single emotion that you can hold in your body just came out when I crossed that finish line,'' she said.\n\n\"It wasn't surprise, it wasn't shock, I was just proud, so proud of what I had done to get here.\"\n\nPearson, 30, has been dogged by injury virtually since she won her Olympic gold medal in 2012. In 2013 and 2014 she came back from hamstring injuries to win a world championships silver medal and Commonwealth Games gold in Glasgow.\n\nBut she missed the 2015 world titles after smashing her wrist in a horrific race fall, and hamstring and Achilles problems, as well as ongoing issues with her wrist, put paid to her Olympic campaign last year.\n\nSo it had been four years since Pearson had stepped into the blocks to try and win a global championship, four years in which she never stopped believing, changed coaches twice and eventually decided to coach herself 12 months ago. The indestructible sense of belief is what has separated her from all other athletes of her generation.\n\n\"2015 and 2016 - twelve months with four severe injuries and then in August the first day of athletics at the Olympics I decided to coach myself,'' she recalled.\n\n\"It took me hours and hours and hours on the first day to write a program out and decide what was best for me and what I could and couldn't do, being an older athlete, having these injury troubles.\n\n\"And taking those first steps onto the track, my training partners saying 'you can do this'. I've got the most tight-knit little squad, I call them Team Pearson, of my friends and my mum and my husband and my training partners, I've only got two of them.\n\n\"They're the ones I have to thank tonight because don't think I would be here without them. They had more belief than me coming into tonight.\"\n\nHowever Pearson admitted that when she sat down to write out her training program on the first day of the Rio Olympics, she already believed that she could win this world title, despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\n\"From the first day I started training I knew it was possible,'' she said.\n\n\"I knew I could get here and I remember someone saying 'you can be the world champion again' and I didn't feel awkward about that. When I felt that, I knew it was in me to do it. If I don't feel that spark I know there's something wrong but I felt it straight away.\"\n\nTwelve months on and Pearson announced she was back when she finished a strong second to world record-holder Kendra Harrison at the Diamond League meet in London last month, setting a time of 12.48sec, her fastest in five years.\n\nComing into the world titles, 24-year-old Harrison was the only competitor she had who had run faster but the American had never competed for a global title and that lack of experience would be crucial.\n\nIn this environment Pearson is a shark and she smelled blood the moment she qualified fastest for the final and Harrison messed up her semi-final only just scraping into the final.\n\nAustralian head coach Craig Hilliard would later reveal that Harrison had changed her warm up before the final and surmised that there were \"demons in her head''. Pearso, by contrast, did her warm up exactly the same way as she had before the semi-final.\n\n\"I knew I was going to be capable of doing well at major championships, it was just a matter of could she (Harrison), I didn't know if she could or not,'' Pearson said.\n\n\"I then just had to stop focussing on what other athletes were doing and what they were achieving because I knew what I was capable of and I just had to believe in myself\n\nThey were drawn next to each other but as Pearson settled into her starting blocks she told herself: \"Let's go, Let's go fast. That is all you have to do, there is no thinking about this, let's just go.''\n\nHarrison got the better start but Pearson was pressuring her by the second hurdle and the American blinked, then stumbled, as Pearson started to run away from her, going on to win in 12.59sec.\n\nPearson's old sparring partner Dawn Harper Nelson, who was the silver medallist behind her in London in 2012, again claimed the silver (12.63sec) and Germany's Pamela Dutkiewcz (12.72sec) competed the podium.\n\nHarrison, 24, missed the medals at her first world titles, finishing fourth in 12.74sec, more than half a second outside her world record.\n\nLater Pearson would observe that she and Harper Nelson were \"big championship contenders, we know what to do, we know how to get the job done.\"\n\n\"I came into this race and I knew she was probably going to be the one to beat and it was a matter of does anyone else know how to run a championships?''\n\nThe answer at this stage is: No.\n\nGold Coast native Pearson will now turn her attention to defending her Commonwealth Games crown in her hometown next April.\n\nAnd she is keen to press on to Tokyo, to replace the Olympics she lost in Rio.\n\n\"I love the idea of going to a third Olympics,''s she said.\n\n\"I missed out in Rio 2016 and so I'd love the idea of going to Tokyo, but that's another three years to go and it's a matter of whether my body can handle it.\n\n\"I'm 30 years old, 31 next month and it's a matter of whether my body can hold up. Being smarter and looking after myself - that's what got me here tonight. Can I do it for another three years? I don't know. I'll tell you in three years.\"", "timeCrawl": "23:09:00", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8852816", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "id": 256, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "id": 527, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World_Building", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World Building", "id": 766, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "id": 824, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports", "id": 1330, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

In the current era, she's right up there with the best.''\n\nPearson is now one of three Australian athletes who have won two world titles, joining Freeman and 400m hurdler Jana Pittman, and she has done it in the most \u00adunpredictable of events.\n\nOnly three women have won more than one world title in the 100m hurdles, but Pearson is the only one who has done it over a six-year span, and she is the only one who has also won an Olympic gold medal for the sprint hurdles.\n\nFreeman acknowledged Pearson's feat on Twitter \u00adyesterday, saying \"What a champion you are''. To which Pearson responded: \"This tweet is Better than gold''.\n\nHilliard said that after four years in which Pearson struggled with injuries and was unable to compete at a global level, this was \"one of the greatest comebacks in Australian history''.\n\nMore remarkably, she has done that while coaching herself, which is extremely rare at the elite level.\n\nAfter hamstring and achilles tendon injuries forced her out of last year's Rio Olympics, Pearson was on the verge of quitting.\n\nShe revealed earlier this year that she was pondering retirement until she took a plane trip and happened to watch a documentary on fellow Olympic gold medallist Lydia Lassila's comeback after becoming a mother, The Will to Fly.\n\n\"I was blown away,'' she said. \"Then as I was walking out of the airport, I said, 'Right, that's it. I've made my decision. I'm going to get back into training and I'm going to coach myself'.''\n\nAfter splitting with her original coach Sharon Hannan in 2013, Pearson employed two former training partners, Antony Drinkwater-Newman and then Ash \u00adMahoney, to coach her, but ultimately decided that she knew her body best. \"I knew that I could do it, I wasn't worried about writing the program out, I knew what I could and couldn't handle, it was just a matter of, 'Am I going to do it right? Is this the right person to do it for me, which is me? ... Am I going to be able to listen to my body and be smart about it and look after it?' I just said: 'Well, you're going to have to try'.\" Pearson revealed that on the first day of the Rio Olympics a year ago she sat down and mapped out a training program designed to bring her to this peak on this day.\n\n\"It took me hours and hours and hours on the first day to write a program out and decide what was best for me and what I could and couldn't do, being an older athlete, having these injury troubles.\n\n\"From the first day I started training I knew it was possible. I knew I could get here and I remember someone saying, 'You can be the world champion again' and I didn't feel awkward about that. When I felt that, I knew it was in me to do it. If I don't feel that spark, I know there's something wrong, but I felt it straight away.\"\n\nPearson's indestructible self-belief is what makes her extraordinary, but she gave a hint of the depths of resilience she had to mine in the moments after she won the world title. \"Far out, that was bloody hard,'' she said. \"I was so tired. That was just incredible.''\n\nLater she would reveal that \u00adbeyond elation or relief, her overwhelming emotion was pride.\n\n\"Every single emotion that you can hold in your body just came out when I crossed that finish line. It wasn't surprise, it wasn't shock, I was just proud, so proud of what I had done to get here.\"\n\nIn the final two weeks before the championships, Pearson turned over her coach's hat to Hilliard and team coach Matt Beckenham so she could focus purely on being an athlete.\n\nShe seemed nervous before her heat and her time was not the fastest, but she came out for the semi-final flinty-eyed and ready to sow doubt into the minds of her rivals, particularly the one woman in the field faster than her, the new world record-holder Kendra Harrison.\n\nShe was the top qualifier for the final, while Harrison made a crucial error, smashing into the first hurdle, and only just scraped into the final. Pearson smelled blood.\n\n\"I knew I was going to be capable of doing well at a major championship, it was just a matter of could she (Harrison), I didn't know if she could or not,'' Pearson said.\n\nThey were drawn next to each other but as Pearson settled into her starting blocks, she told herself: \"Let's go. Let's go fast. That is all you have to do, there is no thinking about this, let's just go.''\n\nHarrison got the better start, but Pearson was pressuring her by the second hurdle and the American blinked then stumbled as Pearson started to run away from her and went on to win in 12.59sec.\n\nPearson's old sparring partner Dawn Harper Nelson, who was the silver medallist behind her in London in 2012, again claimed the silver (12.63sec) and Germany's Pamela Dutkiewcz (12.72sec) \u00adcompleted the podium.\n\nHarrison missed the medals, finishing fourth in 12.74sec, more than half a second outside her world record.", "timeCrawl": "17:02:00", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8943978", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "id": 485, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "id": 487, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

put two years of injury hell behind her started well on Friday as she coasted into the 100-meter hurdles final.\n\nThe 30-year-old -- the 2011 world champion -- missed both the 2015 world championships and 2016 Olympics because of serious injuries, losing out on the former after suffering a \"bone explosion\" in her wrist in a terrible fall at a meet.\n\nThe perils of this event were evident in the heats when Trinidadian Deborah John crashed into the fifth obstacle, requiring medical attention for over 10 minutes before being fitted with a neck brace and stretchered off the track.\n\nPearson looked in determined mood right from the outset, dominating her heat to take it in 12.71 seconds from America's 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper-Nelson.\n\n\"It was a lot of fun out there,\" said Pearson, whose Olympic triumph came in the same stadium.\n\n\"I was pretty nervous because it has been a while since I've done a championship race but I felt comfortable.\n\n\"I feel I have more to give, so I'm intrigued to see what I can do.\"\n\nPearson, a two-time Commonwealth champion, admitted she had thought her championship days were over, especially after a hamstring injury ruled her out of the defense of her Olympic title in Rio.\n\n\"You go through those thoughts thousands of times but there is something inside you which keeps you going and I'm glad I did,\" she said.\n\nPearson reappeared later on Friday for the semifinals where she faced stiffer opposition and was able to measure herself against American world record holder Kendra Harrison.

(AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\n\nPAT GRAHAM, AP Sports Writer\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Besieged by injuries, Sally Pearson missed nearly two years. Beleaguered by some bad results, Dawn Harper-Nelson hasn't been quite the same, either.\n\nYet there they were down the stretch, two Olympic 100-meter hurdles gold medalists vying for the title at the world championships on Saturday. Just like old times, they were reunited on the podium -- Pearson taking first and Harper-Nelson winding up second.\n\nA couple of 30-somethings holding off the next wave of hurdlers.\n\n\"Toward the end, I could see Sally out of the corner of my eye. I was like, 'Of course it's me and her,'\" the 33-year-old Harper-Nelson said. \"But it was so sweet for it to be me and her, to come across the line. Silver tastes like gold and Dawn is not laying her head down sad tonight.\"\n\nThese two have seen plenty of each other over the years.\n\nHarper-Nelson was the 2008 Beijing Games champion, with Pearson taking silver. Four years later at the London Olympics, the order was reversed.\n\nThey could've broken the tie at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, but neither earned a spot. Pearson was sidelined by a torn hamstring and Harper-Nelson simply didn't run fast enough at trials to make the squad.\n\nHeading into this season, Pearson could tell she was in title-chasing condition. After all, she felt that \"spark\" while training.\n\n\"I knew I could get here,\" the Australian said.\n\nSo did Harper-Nelson, especially after making a talent-rich team at the U.S. championships.\n\nThis is, after all, the team that swept the medals at the Olympics last year, and that placed four women in this year's final, three of whom weren't even on the team for Rio.\n\nThey were Harper-Nelson, Christina Manning and the world-record holder, Kendra Harrison.\n\nBut there would be no repeat.\n\nPearson spoiled those plans by finishing in 12.59 seconds, 0.04 ahead of Harper-Nelson. Pamela Dutkiewicz of Germany edged out Harrison for the bronze by .02 seconds.\n\n\"I've worked so hard. I don't know what has just happened out there,\" said Pearson, who broke her wrist during a fall in a Diamond League meet in 2015. \"I'm so tired, but I'm sure it will sink in soon.\"\n\nPearson's attention in this race was on Harper-Nelson, two spots to her right, though it was hard to ignore the clanging sound to her left; it was Harrison, who was clipping hurdles again and again.\n\n\"I said, 'She's hitting hurdles. Don't you get into that rhythm, don't you fall into hitting hurdles. You're going well. You're the most consistent one out there. Just keep running and go fast,'\" said Pearson, who turns 31 next month. \"That's when I put pedal down and didn't want to look anymore.\"\n\nPearson crossed the finish line, looked to her right and saw Harper-Nelson was barely behind. The camera showed the Aussie mouthing, \"Oh My God, Oh My God,\" and she just kept right on running toward the stands.\n\nA moment later, Harper-Nelson gave her a heartfelt embrace.\n\n\"We were talking to each other and I said, 'Girl, it's me and you again,'\" Harper-Nelson said. \"We've been doing this since '08. It shows we're strong competitors. Once again, you can never count us out. When Sally is there, Dawn is there. It's a sweet rivalry.\"\n\nThen, it was cartwheel time for Harper-Nelson and she did a series of them. She celebrated hard after being on the sideline for the last Olympics.\n\n\"You have to stay positive and understand one race doesn't define you,\" Harper-Nelson said. \"When you look at the big picture, I show up time and time again.\"\n\nPearson does, too.\n\n\"It's been a hard run to get here,\" she said. \"But I'm just so proud what I've been able to achieve.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP track coverage: https://www.apnews.com/tag/London2017", "timeCrawl": "05:24:00", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 272, "amb": false, "textEnd": 285}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8875392", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "id": 385, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "id": 386, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I don't get emotional that often but you couldn't help getting emotional in that with just the whole build-up and what she's done in the last few weeks.\n\n\"She's an incredibly steely competitor to do what she's done.

Beleaguered by some bad results, Dawn Harper-Nelson hasn't been quite the same, either.\n\nYet there they were down the stretch, two Olympic 100-meter hurdles gold medalists vying for the title at the world championships on Saturday. Just like old times, they were reunited on the podium, with Pearson taking first and Harper-Nelson winding up second, a couple of 30-somethings holding off the next wave of hurdlers.\n\n\"Toward the end, I could see Sally out of the corner of my eye. I was like, 'Of course it's me and her,'\" the 33-year-old Harper-Nelson said. \"But it was so sweet for it to be me and her, to come across the line. Silver tastes like gold, and Dawn is not laying her head down sad tonight.\"\n\nThese two have seen plenty of each other over the years. Harper-Nelson was the 2008 Beijing Games champion, with Pearson taking silver. Four years later at the London Olympics, the order was reversed.\n\nThey could've broken the tie at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, but neither earned a spot. Pearson was sidelined by a torn hamstring and Harper-Nelson simply didn't run fast enough at trials to make the squad.\n\nHeading into this season, Pearson could tell she was in title-chasing condition. After all, she felt that \"spark\" while training.\n\n\"I knew I could get here,\" the Australian said.\n\nSo did Harper-Nelson, especially after she made a talent-rich team at the U.S. championships.\n\nThis is, after all, the team that swept the medals at the Olympics last year and placed four women in this year's final, three of whom weren't on the team for Rio. They were Harper-Nelson, Christina Manning and the world-record holder, Kendra Harrison.\n\nBut there would be no repeat. Pearson spoiled those plans by finishing in 12.59 seconds, 0.04 ahead of Harper-Nelson. Pamela Dutkiewicz of Germany edged Harrison for the bronze by .002 seconds.\n\n\"I've worked so hard. I don't know what has just happened out there,\" said Pearson, who broke her wrist during a fall in a Diamond League meet in 2015. \"I'm so tired, but I'm sure it will sink in soon.\"\n\nPearson's attention in this race was on Harper-Nelson, two spots to her right, though it was hard to ignore the clanging sound to her left. It was Harrison, who was clipping hurdles again and again.\n\n\"I said, 'She's hitting hurdles. Don't you get into that rhythm. Don't you fall into hitting hurdles. You're going well. You're the most consistent one out there. Just keep running and go fast,'\" said Pearson, who turns 31 next month. \"That's when I put pedal down and didn't want to look anymore.\"\n\nPearson crossed the finish line, looked to her right and saw that Harper-Nelson was barely behind. The camera showed the Aussie mouthing, \"Oh my God, oh my God,\" and she just kept right on running toward the stands.\n\nA moment later, Harper-Nelson gave her a heartfelt embrace.\n\n\"We were talking to each other, and I said, 'Girl, it's me and you again,'\" Harper-Nelson said. \"We've been doing this since '08. It shows we're strong competitors. Once again, you can never count us out. When Sally is there, Dawn is there. It's a sweet rivalry.\"\n\nThen it was cartwheel time for Harper-Nelson, and she did a series of them. She celebrated hard after being on the sideline for the most recent Olympics.\n\n\"You have to stay positive and understand one race doesn't define you,\" Harper-Nelson said. \"When you look at the big picture, I show up time and time again.\"\n\nPearson does, too.\n\n\"It's been a hard run to get here,\" she said. \"But I'm just so proud [of] what I've been able to achieve.\"", "timeCrawl": "01:35:00", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8861154", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "id": 385, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "id": 386, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

She looked out of it, but made a remarkable recovery over the other nine hurdles to grab third place and the final spot in the final.\n\nPearson watched open-mouthed in the mixed zone as the only woman in the field who has run faster than her was almost eliminated.\n\nPearson's perennial rival Dawn Harper-Nelson won that semi-final in 12.63sec as Harrison qualified by 0.01sec in 12.86sec.\n\nAmong the casualties in the cutthroat second round was the defending world champion Danielle Williams of Jamaica, who finished fifth in the second semi-final, won by American Christine Manning in 12.17sec. Australia's second hurdler Michelle Jenneke was eliminated after finishing seventh in that race in 13.25sec.\n\nPearson's response to the drama surrounding Harrison showed just how extraordinary a big occasion competitor she is.\n\nWhen Harrison's place in the final was confirmed, her first thought was \"it doesn't matter''.\n\n\"Tomorrow is another day and I just have to make sure I'm the fastest one out there.''\n\nThe sprint hurdles is the most unpredictable event on the track program, chaos is only ever a fraction of a second away in any race but Pearson noted that she had been the \"most consistent one out there'' through the first two rounds.\n\nPearson said her excellent semi-final run was fuelled by her dissatisfaction with her heat run earlier in the day. She won her heat, but Harrison ran faster in her heat, which got Pearson's competitive juices flowing.\n\n\"I was disappointed with my heat,'' she said.\n\n\"I felt so good and ran 12.7. I don't like going in not the fastest so I had to come out and run that just to say I'm the fastest.\n\n\"I was at the start going, what if I lose, what if I lose, what if I lose, but I was like, just got to run anyway. I just did what I could. I knew I was in good shape so it was just a matter of doing it and making sure my execution outweighed my doubts.\n\n\"I was more nervous for the heat than that semi-final. I thought I'm going to have to do something because I'm not feeling great but maybe that's just how I handle things now.''\n\nIt has been four years since Pearson last had the chance to compete for a global title, due to a succession of injury woes, but she said she would be going after the gold medal tonight.\n\n\"There's nothing to lose,'' she said.\n\n\"I don't have anything to lose. I've done everything I can possibly do in the sport. It's just a matter of how much further can I go and what else can I get.''\n\nShe said she was still respectful of Harrison's exceptional speed but would put together the best race she could.\n\n\"It's just a matter of being competitive now, being faster than the rest of them.''\n\nHistorically, Pearson has done that better than any other hurdler of her generation.\n\nShe won her first world title in 2011, setting a championships record of 12.28sec which still stands, and won her Olympic gold medal in 2012 in the London stadium where she will again run for glory tonight.\n\nShe missed the 2015 world titles and last year's Rio Olympics due to injuries but with a return to full health and having decided to coach herself she has re-emerged as a top contender this year.\n\nA relieved Harrison said she was grateful that she managed to overcome her early error and get through to the final.\n\n\"I think that first little hiccup (a false start) threw me off, but I just tried to make it through. I'm excited for the final, it's my first one, and I'm ready to come out here and get the job done,\" Harrison said.\n\n\"Unfortunately I hit the first hurdle and I just had to readjust. I had to tell myself not to panic because I've done the training. I've run the world record in this stadium so I was capable of making up for the error. I didn't hurt myself so I'm fine.\n\n\"I can't worry about one performance. I've done a lot of work so I have to trust that.\"", "timeCrawl": "20:25:00", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8695585", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "id": 385, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "id": 386, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Beleaguered by some bad results, Dawn Harper-Nelson hasn't been quite the same, either.\n\nYet there they were down the stretch, two Olympic 100-meter hurdles gold medalists vying for the title at the world championships on Saturday. Just like old times, they were reunited on the podium - Pearson taking first and Harper winding up second.\n\nA couple of 30-somethings holding off the next wave of hurdlers.\n\nWomen's 100 meters hurdles final silver medalist United States' Dawn Harper Nelson embraces gold medalist Australia's Sally Pearson, left, at the World Athletics Championships in London Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\n\n\"Toward the end, I could see Sally out of the corner of my eye. I was like, 'Of course it's me and her,'\" the 33-year-old Harper-Nelson said. \"But it was so sweet for it to be me and her, to come across the line. Silver tastes like gold and Dawn is not laying her head down sad tonight.\"\n\nThese two have seen plenty of each other over the years.\n\nHarper-Nelson was the 2008 Beijing Games champion, with Pearson taking silver. Four years later at the London Olympics, the order was reversed.\n\nThey could've broken the tie at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, but neither earned a spot. Pearson was sidelined by a torn hamstring and Harper-Nelson simply didn't run fast enough at trials to make the squad.\n\nHeading into this season, Pearson could tell she was in title-chasing condition. After all, she felt that \"spark\" while training.\n\n\"I knew I could get here,\" the Australian said.\n\nSo did Harper-Nelson, especially after making a talent-rich team at the U.S. championships.\n\nThis is, after all, the team that swept the medals at the Olympics last year, and that placed four women in this year's final, three of whom weren't even on the team for Rio.\n\nThey were Harper-Nelson, Christina Manning and the world-record holder, Kendra Harrison.\n\nBut there would be no repeat.\n\nPearson spoiled those plans by finishing in 12.59 seconds, 0.04 ahead of Harper-Nelson. Pamela Dutkiewicz of Germany edged out Harrison for the bronze by .001 seconds.\n\n\"I've worked so hard. I don't know what has just happened out there,\" said Pearson, who also dislocated her wrist during a fall in a Diamond League meet in 2015. \"I'm so tired, but I'm sure it will sink in soon.\"\n\nPearson's attention in this race was on Harper-Nelson, two spots to her right, though it was hard to ignore the clanging sound to her left; it was Harrison, who was clipping hurdles again and again.\n\n\"I said, 'She's hitting hurdles. Don't you get into that rhythm, don't you fall into hitting hurdles. You're going well. You're the most consistent one out there. Just keep running and go fast,'\" said Pearson, who turns 31 next month. \"That's when I put pedal down and didn't want to look anymore.\"\n\nPearson crossed the finish line, looked to her right and saw Harper-Nelson was barely behind. The camera showed the Aussie mouthing, \"Oh My God, Oh My God,\" and she just kept right on running toward the stands.\n\nA moment later, Harper-Nelson gave her a heartfelt embrace.\n\n\"We were talking to each other and I said, 'Girl, it's me and you again,'\" Harper-Nelson said. \"We've been doing this since '08. It shows we're strong competitors. Once again, you can never count us out. When Sally is there, Dawn is there. It's a sweet rivalry.\"\n\nThen, it was cartwheel time for Harper-Nelson and she did a series of them. She celebrated hard after being on the sideline for the last Olympics.\n\n\"You have to stay positive and understand one race doesn't define you,\" Harper-Nelson said. \"When you look at the big picture, I show up time and time again.\"\n\nPearson does, too.\n\n\"It's been a hard run to get here,\" she said. \"But I'm just so proud what I've been able to achieve.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP track coverage: https://www.apnews.com/tag/London2017\n\nWomen's 100 meters hurdles final silver medalist United States' Dawn Harper Nelson looks to embrace and congratulate gold medalist Australia's Sally Pearson, left, at the World Athletics Championships in London Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017.

On the eve of her 31st birthday she arrived in London as a relative outsider and won gold.\n\n\"Every single emotion that you can hold in your body just came out when I crossed that finish line. It wasn't surprise, it wasn't shock. I was just proud, so proud of what I had done to get here,\" she said after winning the gold in 12.59s from American Dawn Harper-Nelson and Germany's Pamela Dutkiewicz.\n\nShe crossed the line screaming \"oh my God\" repeatedly after surged towards the crowd to celebrate, looking for her mum and husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've worked so hard, I don't know what has just happened out there. I'm so tired but I'm sure it will sink in soon,\" said Pearson,\n\nHaving overcome injuries and coaching Person also had to beat the pre-race favourite, world record holder Kendra Harrison from America.\n\n\"I certainly wasn't the fastest in the field today but I definitely beat the fastest and I am the World Champion,\" she said.\n\nThis tweet is Better than gold! https://t.co/tZ8V8WyOeU -- Sally Pearson OAM (@sallypearson)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nWhile the world watched for a race in two between Pearson and Harrison, Pearson knew the biggest threat would be Harper-Nelson who won gold ahead of Pearson in silver at the Beijing Olympics and who won silver to Pearson's gold at the London Olympics.\n\nHarper-Nelson, who served a three month drug ban earlier this year, said she crossed the line thinking she might have won then looked and saw Pearson.\n\n\"I was like 'Of course it's Sally'. To cross the line it was like 'OK Sally (got gold) but silver is good. This silver is going to taste like gold tonight,\"she said.\n\nPearson said her outsider, or challenger, status here made it feel a little sweeter than when she won her first world championship in Daegu six years ago.\n\n\"I think so, I went to Daegu and I was winning, right from a year out I was going to win the world championships,\" she said\n\n\"Every medal is different and this one sure is very different to the rest of them.\"\n\nPearson's success preceded a heartbreaking end to the career of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympic champion appearing to strain a hamstring in the final leg of the men's 4x100m relay. He failed to finish and Great Britain won gold.\n\nAfter taking the baton from his teammate Yohan Blake, Bolt began to gather speed only to pull up and shout in pain about 60m from the finish line.\n\nIt was hardly the farewell party that Bolt, the greatest sprinter in history, had in mind when he decided to make this meet the last of his career.\n\nHis injury - later confirmed as severe cramp - would normally have cast a pall over the rest of the race, but it has been a frustrating meet for Britain, the host country. And with Bolt on the ground and the Jamaicans out of contention, the gold came down to a sprint for the finish between Christian Coleman of the United States and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake of Britain.\n\nBritain won by 0.05 seconds, finishing in 37.47 seconds to the Americans' 37.52. As the official results flashed on the big screen, the crowd cheered wildly for Britain's second gold medal of these championships.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolt's teammates rushed to help him as he lay on the track.\n\nWith AAP", "timeCrawl": "06:45:00", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 4163, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4178}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8880941", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "id": 551, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "id": 604, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "id": 742, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "id": 832, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Handcrafted", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Handcrafted", "id": 1445, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "id": 1618, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

the 2011 world champion - missed both the 2015 world championships and 2016 Olympics because of serious injuries, losing out on the former after suffering a \"bone explosion\" in her wrist in a terrible fall at a meet.\n\nThe perils of this event were evident in the heats when Trinidadian Deborah John crashed into the fifth obstacle requiring medical attention for over 10 minutes before being fitted with a neck brace and stretchered off the track.\n\nPearson looked in determined mood right from the outset, dominating her heat to take it in 12.71sec from America's 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper-Nelson.\n\nPearson will reappear later on Friday for the semi-finals where she will face stiffer opposition and be able to measure herself against American world record holder Kendra Harrison.\n\nHarrison looked good in her heat as she flew from the blocks and was never challenged, crossing the line in 12.60sec with Belarus 2015 world bronze medalist Alina Talay edging Jamaica's former world youth champion Yanique Thompson for second.\n\nDefending champion Danielle Williams looked silky smooth in her heat, the Jamaican gliding over the hurdles to win in 12.66sec ahead of promising German champion Pamela Dutkiewicz.\n\nJamaica - who have had a below-par championships - look to have a strong hand in the event and their national champion Megan Simmonds impressed in leading from the gun to ease home in 12.78sec ahead of America's Olympic silver medalist Nia Ali.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "timeCrawl": "12:28:00", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8612179", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Machinery_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Machinery and Tools", "id": 165, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Australian sport, new world champion Sally Pearson summed up her emotions with one word - proud.\n\nAfter two years of injuries and numerous obstacles, the 30-year-old had stared down the world record holder and won her second world 100m hurdles title.\n\n\"The first thing that comes to mind when I crossed that finish line was obviously excitement and emotion but also proud, so proud,\" she said.\n\n\"Every single emotion that you can hold in your body just came out when I crossed that finish line. It wasn't surprise, it wasn't shock, I was just proud, so proud of what I had done to get here.\"\n\nPearson's victory puts her on the pedestal of Australia's sporting greats and she now goes past Sydney Olympics golden girl Cathy Freeman.\n\nFreeman won Olympic gold and silver plus two world titles.\n\nThe Gold Coast hurdler has one more world championship medal in her CV with two world titles, a silver at world championships to go with Olympic gold and silver medals.\n\nAfter being the fastest qualifier into the final, the 2011 world champion took control of the race at the third hurdle where world record holder Kendra Harrison started to falter.\n\nShe then powered away in the second half of the race to take gold in 12.59sec, holding off another veteran American Dawn Harper Nelson (12.63sec), who'd relegated her to second in the 2008 Olympic final.\n\nHarrison faded to finish fourth.\n\nThe look of shock on Pearson's face as she crossed the line was reminiscent to when she won the surprise Olympic silver medal in Beijing.\n\n\"(Silver in) 2008 was a surprise, in a way that was just pure excitement,\" Pearson said.\n\n\"But it did feel a little bit like '08 I guess, with the celebration and the excitement. London (2012) was such a relief more than anything, to get it done.\n\n\"And with these world championships, yes it's a relief to get it done, but I think the last four years, 2013 even I had injuries, so year after year I had that and then to come out here, knowing I haven't been injured, that I'd done everything I possibly can.\n\n\"I've left no stone unturned to get here.\"\n\nHarper Nelson admitted she wasn't surprised to look across on the finish line and see that it was the Australian who'd denied her the gold medal.\n\n\"Me and Sally have just battled it out for years and it's been so great to be here with her,\" Harper Nelson said.\n\n\"Silver tastes like gold tonight. I could see Sally had won and I thought 'it's me and Sally again'.\"\n\nPearson's problems started in 2015 when she broke her wrist in a race fall in Rome at the Diamond League event.\n\nShe then missed the Rio Olympics because of Achilles and hamstring problems.\n\nIt was as the athletics program began in Brazil last year that Pearson decided to coach herself which proved to be a masterstroke.\n\n\"On the first day of athletics at the Olympics I decided to coach myself,\" she said.\n\n\"It took me hours and hours and hours on the first day to write a program out and decide what was best for me and what I could and couldn't do, being an older athlete, having these injury troubles.\n\n\"But I knew I could do it.\"\n\nThe last time Pearson raced at a championships was when she won gold at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.\n\nHer last appearance at the world titles was in Moscow in 2013 where she claimed the silver medal.\n\nThe Australian still holds the world championships record of 12.28sec from her victory in Daegu in 2011.", "timeCrawl": "23:05:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8852542", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "id": 256, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "id": 742, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "id": 832, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "id": 1618, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 5}}

Beleaguered by some bad results, Dawn Harper-Nelson hasn't been quite the same, either.\n\nYet there they were down the stretch, two Olympic 100-meter hurdles gold medalists vying for the title at the world championships on Saturday. Just like old times, they were reunited on the podium -- Pearson taking first and Harper-Nelson winding up second.\n\nA couple of 30-somethings holding off the next wave of hurdlers.\n\n\"Toward the end, I could see Sally out of the corner of my eye. I was like, 'Of course it's me and her,'\" the 33-year-old Harper-Nelson said. \"But it was so sweet for it to be me and her, to come across the line. Silver tastes like gold and Dawn is not laying her head down sad tonight.\"\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nThese two have seen plenty of each other over the years.\n\nHarper-Nelson was the 2008 Beijing Games champion, with Pearson taking silver. Four years later at the London Olympics, the order was reversed.\n\nThey could've broken the tie at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, but neither earned a spot. Pearson was sidelined by a torn hamstring and Harper-Nelson simply didn't run fast enough at trials to make the squad.\n\nHeading into this season, Pearson could tell she was in title-chasing condition. After all, she felt that \"spark\" while training.\n\n\"I knew I could get here,\" the Australian said.\n\nSo did Harper-Nelson, especially after making a talent-rich team at the U.S. championships.\n\nSEC warns TSP participants of new scam\n\nThis is, after all, the team that swept the medals at the Olympics last year, and that placed four women in this year's final, three of whom weren't even on the team for Rio.\n\nThey were Harper-Nelson, Christina Manning and the world-record holder, Kendra Harrison.\n\nBut there would be no repeat.\n\nPearson spoiled those plans by finishing in 12.59 seconds, 0.04 ahead of Harper-Nelson. Pamela Dutkiewicz of Germany edged out Harrison for the bronze by .001 seconds.\n\n\"I've worked so hard. I don't know what has just happened out there,\" said Pearson, who broke her wrist during a fall in a Diamond League meet in 2015. \"I'm so tired, but I'm sure it will sink in soon.\"\n\nPearson's attention in this race was on Harper-Nelson, two spots to her right, though it was hard to ignore the clanging sound to her left; it was Harrison, who was clipping hurdles again and again.\n\n\"I said, 'She's hitting hurdles. Don't you get into that rhythm, don't you fall into hitting hurdles. You're going well. You're the most consistent one out there. Just keep running and go fast,'\" said Pearson, who turns 31 next month. \"That's when I put pedal down and didn't want to look anymore.\"\n\nPearson crossed the finish line, looked to her right and saw Harper-Nelson was barely behind. The camera showed the Aussie mouthing, \"Oh My God, Oh My God,\" and she just kept right on running toward the stands.\n\nA moment later, Harper-Nelson gave her a heartfelt embrace.\n\n\"We were talking to each other and I said, 'Girl, it's me and you again,'\" Harper-Nelson said. \"We've been doing this since '08. It shows we're strong competitors. Once again, you can never count us out. When Sally is there, Dawn is there. It's a sweet rivalry.\"\n\nThen, it was cartwheel time for Harper-Nelson and she did a series of them. She celebrated hard after being on the sideline for the last Olympics.\n\n\"You have to stay positive and understand one race doesn't define you,\" Harper-Nelson said. \"When you look at the big picture, I show up time and time again.\"\n\nPearson does, too.\n\n\"It's been a hard run to get here,\" she said. \"But I'm just so proud what I've been able to achieve.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP track coverage: https://www.apnews.com/tag/London2017", "timeCrawl": "00:27:00", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8857642", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "id": 385, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "id": 386, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

After three lost years ruined by injury, Pearson has completed the most remarkable comeback to win gold at the London world championships and in doing so has been elevated among the greatest Australian athletes ever.\n\nPearson now stands alongside Catherine Freeman as one of Australia's best modern track athletes after adding a second world championship gold to a silver in Moscow and her Olympic gold and silver.\n\nThis victory, she admits, is as sweet as any after the journey she has undertaken to get here - four years lost from major championships, putting aside the lesser Commonwealth Games, ruined by serious calf, Achilles and hamstring injuries as well as a wrist shattered in a fall.\n\nOn top of that she sacked her last coach and began coaching herself on the day the athletics began at the Rio Olympics last year and sat down in her Gold Coast home to write out a plan to get her back to the top of the world. Then on the eve of her 31st birthday she arrived in London as a relative outsider and won gold.\n\n\"Every single emotion that you can hold in your body just came out when I crossed that finish line. It wasn't surprise, it wasn't shock. I was just proud, so proud of what I had done to get here,\" she said after winning the gold in 12.59s.\n\n\u1f1e6\u1f1fa IT'S A FAIRYTALE. @sallypearson, 5 years after London Olympic \u1f947, and years of injuries, is back on top of the world #BeTheNextpic.twitter.com/uNXm51AihF -- IAAF World Champs (@IAAFWorldChamps)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\n\"From the first day I started training I knew it was possible, I knew I could get here and I remember someone saying 'you can be the world champion again' and I didn't feel awkward about that. When I knew I felt that, I knew it was in me to do it.\"\n\nHer outsider, or challenger, status here made it feel a little sweeter than when she won her first world championship in Daegu six years ago.\n\n\"I think so, I went to Daegu and I was winning, right from a year out I was going to win the world championships,\" she said\n\n\"Every medal is different and this one sure is very different to the rest of them.\"\n\nA happy little vegemite with her 100m hurdles gold medal. Congrats @sallypearson! #TeamAUSpic.twitter.com/6O9dL1rw8U -- Athletics Australia (@AthsAust)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nPearson's success preceded a heartbreaking end to the career of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympic champion appearing to strain a hamstring in the final leg of the men's 4x100m relay. He failed to finish and Great Britain won gold.\n\nAfter taking the baton from his teammate Yohan Blake, Bolt began to gather speed only to pull up and shout in pain about 60m from the finish line.\n\nIt was hardly the farewell party that Bolt, the greatest sprinter in history, had in mind when he decided to make this meet the last of his career.\n\nHis injury - later confirmed as severe cramp - would normally have cast a pall over the rest of the race, but it has been a frustrating meet for Britain, the host country. And with Bolt on the ground and the Jamaicans out of contention, the gold came down to a sprint for the finish between Christian Coleman of the United States and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake of Britain.\n\nBritain won by 0.05 seconds, finishing in 37.47 seconds to the Americans' 37.52. As the official results flashed on the big screen, the crowd cheered wildly for Britain's second gold medal of these championships.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolt's teammates rushed to help him as he lay on the track.\n\nWith AAP", "timeCrawl": "00:09:00", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 426, "freq": 9, "amb": false, "textEnd": 439}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8856660", "categories": [], "details": {}}

Beleaguered by some bad results, Dawn Harper-Nelson hasn't been quite the same, either.\n\nYet there they were down the stretch, two Olympic 100-meter hurdles gold medalists vying for the title at the world championships on Saturday. Just like old times, they were reunited on the podium - Pearson taking first and Harper-Nelson winding up second.\n\nA couple of 30-somethings holding off the next wave of hurdlers.\n\n\"Toward the end, I could see Sally out of the corner of my eye. I was like, 'Of course it's me and her,'\" the 33-year-old Harper-Nelson said. \"But it was so sweet for it to be me and her, to come across the line. Silver tastes like gold and Dawn is not laying her head down sad tonight.\"\n\nThese two have seen plenty of each other over the years.\n\nHarper-Nelson was the 2008 Beijing Games champion, with Pearson taking silver. Four years later at the London Olympics, the order was reversed.\n\nThey could've broken the tie at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, but neither earned a spot. Pearson was sidelined by a torn hamstring and Harper-Nelson simply didn't run fast enough at trials to make the squad.\n\nHeading into this season, Pearson could tell she was in title-chasing condition. After all, she felt that \"spark\" while training.\n\n\"I knew I could get here,\" the Australian said.\n\nSo did Harper-Nelson, especially after making a talent-rich team at the U.S. championships.\n\nThis is, after all, the team that swept the medals at the Olympics last year, and that placed four women in this year's final, three of whom weren't even on the team for Rio.\n\nThey were Harper-Nelson, Christina Manning and the world-record holder, Kendra Harrison.\n\nBut there would be no repeat.\n\nPearson spoiled those plans by finishing in 12.59 seconds, 0.04 ahead of Harper-Nelson. Pamela Dutkiewicz of Germany edged out Harrison for the bronze by .001 seconds.\n\n\"I've worked so hard. I don't know what has just happened out there,\" said Pearson, who broke her wrist during a fall in a Diamond League meet in 2015. \"I'm so tired, but I'm sure it will sink in soon.\"\n\nPearson's attention in this race was on Harper-Nelson, two spots to her right, though it was hard to ignore the clanging sound to her left; it was Harrison, who was clipping hurdles again and again.\n\n\"I said, 'She's hitting hurdles. Don't you get into that rhythm, don't you fall into hitting hurdles. You're going well. You're the most consistent one out there. Just keep running and go fast,'\" said Pearson, who turns 31 next month. \"That's when I put pedal down and didn't want to look anymore.\"\n\nPearson crossed the finish line, looked to her right and saw Harper-Nelson was barely behind. The camera showed the Aussie mouthing, \"Oh My God, Oh My God,\" and she just kept right on running toward the stands.\n\nA moment later, Harper-Nelson gave her a heartfelt embrace.\n\n\"We were talking to each other and I said, 'Girl, it's me and you again,'\" Harper-Nelson said. \"We've been doing this since '08. It shows we're strong competitors. Once again, you can never count us out. When Sally is there, Dawn is there. It's a sweet rivalry.\"\n\nThen, it was cartwheel time for Harper-Nelson and she did a series of them. She celebrated hard after being on the sideline for the last Olympics.\n\n\"You have to stay positive and understand one race doesn't define you,\" Harper-Nelson said. \"When you look at the big picture, I show up time and time again.\"\n\nPearson does, too.\n\n\"It's been a hard run to get here,\" she said. \"But I'm just so proud what I've been able to achieve.\"", "timeCrawl": "00:25:00", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8857548", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "id": 385, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "id": 386, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I had to tell myself not to panic because I've done the training,\" said the 25-year-old.\n\n\"I've run the world record in this stadium so I was capable of making up for the error.

Story: Comeback queen Sally Pearson wins world championship gold\n\nFor any number of reasons, Cathy Freeman's triumph in the 400m at the 2000 Sydney Olympics arguably stands alone in the annals of Australian track and field history.\n\nHaving lit the cauldron at the opening ceremony, Freeman carried the hopes of a nation to victory.\n\nThat she was the first Indigenous athlete to win individual gold at Olympic level only added to the significance of her triumph.\n\nFreeman's place as an all-time Australian sporting great is unchallenged -- and it always will be.\n\nBut in winning gold in the 100m hurdles at the world titles in London on Saturday night, Sally Pearson can now lay claim to an even better record than Freeman in her favoured event at global championships.\n\nPearson's three major titles came at the 2012 London Olympics and the 2011 and 2017 world championships.\n\nFreeman's three 400m titles were at the Sydney Olympics and the 1997 and 1999 world championships.\n\nBut Pearson has also won two major silver medals, while Freeman only has the one.\n\nFor the first time, a good case can be made that the 30-year-old Pearson is Australia's greatest track and field athlete of the modern era.\n\nAnother interesting comparison is with the great Betty Cuthbert, who died earlier this month aged 79.\n\nIn the amateur era before the world championships, Cuthbert won four Olympic track gold medals in four different events.\n\nCuthbert is the only track and field athlete -- male or female -- to win Olympic titles in the 100m, 200m and 400m.\n\nEven when there were plenty of reasons to think otherwise, Pearson never doubted herself.\n\nJust as importantly, neither did those in her tight inner circle.\n\nAfter several seasons wracked by injury, the decision 12 months ago by the hurdler to coach herself got the blessing of those who mattered most -- including husband Kieran Pearson.\n\n\"(She amazes me) every day,\" said Kieran Pearson, who travels the world track and field circuit with his wife.\n\n\"She is the first person to do that, anyone would be impressed.\n\n\"I have just been lucky enough to see the whole journey and all the struggles she has gone through behind the scenes.\n\n\"I never doubted (the self-coaching) -- she knows her body, she has been doing it more than long enough.\n\n\"She has got the determination that whatever she sets her mind to she is going to do it and she is going to do it properly.\"\n\nOnce Pearson arrived at the pre-championships training camp in Tonbridge she handed responsibility for the final stage of her build-up to Australian head coach Craig Hilliard and team coach Matt Beckenham.\n\nBut the people she wanted to thank first on crossing the line to claim world championships gold in the 100m hurdles were those who had been there every day for the past year and more.\n\n\"I've got the most tight-knit little squad, I call them Team Pearson - my friends and my mum and my husband and my training partners, (although) I've only got two of them,\" she said.\n\n\"They're the ones I have to thank tonight because I don't think I would be here without them.", "timeCrawl": "03:02:00", "sim":

11 out of 21 - accrued by Australia at global championships.\n\nAnother five were won by pole vaulter Steve Hooker and long jumper Mitchell Watt, both of whom are long since retired.\n\nFar too often for Australia at the majors, it's been Pearson and/or Tallent or bust.\n\nHead coach Craig Hilliard believes she is ready to deliver yet again on the big stage.\n\n\"She's an Olympic gold medallist, a world championship gold medallist, she nearly broke the world record in Daegu (in 2011),\" he said on Wednesday night.\n\n\"That's Sally, she is confident in her ability at the moment, she is in a really good space and her warm-up yesterday was fantastic.\n\n\"She's ready to go.\"\n\nNow enjoying the challenge of coaching herself, the 30-year-old Queenslander has made a remarkable return to top-level competition after a string of serious wrist, hamstring and Achilles injuries.\n\nSpeaking last week at the training camp in Tonbridge, Pearson said that given the setbacks she had endured over the past three years, a medal of any colour in London would rank with any of the achievements of her glittering career.\n\nStanding in her way as usual is a flotilla of flying Americans, led by Kendra Harrison, the world record holder.\n\nBut Harrison has yet to prove her mettle in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of a major final.\n\nCountrywoman Brianna Rollins has definitely done that - having beaten Pearson into second spot at the 2013 worlds and claimed Olympic gold in Rio last year.\n\nHowever, Rollins won't be a factor in London as she is serving a one-year ban for missing three doping tests.\n\nThe most encouraging sign yet that Pearson's medal hopes are genuine came last month in the Diamond League meet at the London Olympic Stadium when she flew home for second spot behind Harrison in 12.48.\n\nIt was Pearson's fastest time since the London Olympics - even better than her silver-medal effort at the 2013 world titles.\n\nIt also lifted her to third spot on the 2017 rankings behind only Harrison and fellow American Jasmin Stowers, who failed to qualify for the US team for the world titles.\n\n\"She is a major championships performer - that is what she has got going for her,\" said Hilliard.\n\n\"They should fear Sally.\n\n\"I think she can (challenge them), absolutely - and more importantly Sally believes she can.\"\n\nThe schedule for the 100m hurdles in London is an unusual one, with the heats and semi-final on Friday and the final the following evening (early Sunday AEST).", "timeCrawl": "04:15:00", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8316951", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "id": 935, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Five years after winning the Olympic title on this track, and after two years of crippling injuries which threatened her career, Sally Pearson is back in the final of the 100m hurdles.\n\nThe Australian will still have to beat the reigning world record holder Kendra Harrison of the US to win back the World title she won in 2011, but this remember is the event where anything can and often does go wrong.\n\nIt also remains one of the most competitive - which is why Derval O'Rourke's fourth place finish in 2009 is worthy of a reminder.\n\nPearson clocked 12.53 in winning her semi-final, while Harrison - 6-1 on to win the gold medal - only went through as the slower of the two fastest lowers, third in her semi-final in 12.86 after a brutal start, and close clearance over the first hurdle.\n\nAt 30 Pearson will certainly fancy her chances on Saturday night (8.05pm), although Harrison has run 12.28 earlier this year, to go with her 12.20 world record also clocked her in last year's London Anniversary Games, a few weeks before the Olympics which she missed after also messing up at the US Olympic trials.\n\nPearson has a best of 12.48 this year, her fastest time since winning the 2012 Olympic title. She missed the 2015 World Championships and feared she might have to have her lower arm amputated after she broke it in a \"traumatic\" fall at the Rome Diamond League that summer. Doctors described it as a \"bone explosion\" in her wrist.\n\n\"I've always loved what I do, and I've always been motivated,\" she said after her race. \"I think it's just a matter of wanting to know that I have more to give - and I do. No offence, but it would have been great to be back running at a world championships anywhere in the world, but I guess it's a bonus and super special to be back in London.\"\n\nAfter a long rehab from 2015, Pearson then missed last year's Rio Olympics after tearing her hamstring.\n\nThe final line-up for the women's 800m final on Sunday is now also complete, and unless she runs the wrong way, Caster Semenya should continue her now unbeaten 23-month winning streak at that distance, going back to when the IAAF was forced to suspend its ruling on intersex athletes and hyperandrogenism, in 2015. She won her semi-final in 1:58.90, easy as.\n\nStill the only two women looking any way capable of beating her are Francine Niyonsaba from Burundi, and the 21-year-old Kenyan Margaret Wambui, also understood to be athletes with hyperandrogenism - or elevated testosterone levels seemingly to be of particular benefit in women's 800m running.

far side of Sydney Olympic Park.\n\nIt was a windy day in April for the national championships and organisers had decided to move the 100m hurdles final to the back straight to assist the runners.\n\nSUPER SALLY: PEARSON CHAMPION OF THE WORLD AGAIN\n\nOnce again Sally Pearson was the main attraction, but there was more interest than normal about the event.\n\nThis was the first look at the self-coached Pearson who had been off the scene for more than two years because of injury.\n\nShe'd run some indoor meets in Europe in February and had also done a couple of trials on the Gold Coast, but this was her first big test.\n\nAustralian head coach Craig Hilliard was as interested as anyone given he desperately needed his flagship performer back in the mix for the world championships in London four months later.\n\nWhat he saw blew him away and reduced Pearson to tears.\n\nThe 2012 Olympic champion ran 12.53sec to win by space and while there was an illegal-wind reading, the time was a statement.\n\n\"What she did at the nationals was phenomenal,\" Hilliard said. \"It was windy but you still have to turn your legs over that fast and she did and I thought, 'OK, she's gone to a whole new level now'. I think that gave her an enormous degree of confidence.\"\n\nThe Pearson comeback started the previous August while Hilliard was in Rio with Australia's track and field team.\n\nShe wasn't there because of Achilles and hamstring problems had forced her to withdraw. This came on top of a broken wrist in 2015 which had resulted in her missing the world championships.\n\nAfter a holiday to New Zealand and a lot of soul searching with her husband, Kieran, where thoughts of hanging up the spikes were seriously discussed, Pearson decided she was going to give it one last crack. But this time it was going to be different.\n\nShe was going to coach herself.\n\narson had left her long-time coach Sharon Hannan after the 2013 world championships. She then had brief partnerships with unheralded pair Antony Drinkwater-Newman and Ashley Mahoney, which both ended badly.\n\n\"It took me hours and hours and hours on the first day to write a program out and decide what was best for me and what I could and couldn't do, being an older athlete, having these injury troubles,\" she said.\n\n\"I knew that I could do it ... the question was am I going to be able to listen to my body and be smart about it and look after it. I just said, 'Well, you're going to have to try'.\n\n\"I said to myself if it doesn't work out in the first couple of months then we'll have to find someone who can help.\"\n\nShe put together a small team which included her husband, mother, a couple of friends, two training partners, physiotherapist and biomechanist.\n\nEverything clicked.\n\nPearson quietly went about her business. After the nationals she did another stint overseas which included racing at Usain Bolt's last hometown meet in Jamaica.\n\nThe results weren't stunning but it was more about getting familiar again with racing against the world's best.\n\nThen in July she went back to the scene of her greatest triumph, the London Olympic stadium.\n\nHilliard arrived in town that day and once again he had the same reaction after seeing her run 12.48sec -- her fastest time for five years.\n\n\"It blew me away. It was like, 'Wow, she's ready to go now',\" he said. \"That just cemented in her mind what she really could do.\"\n\nKieran agreed.\n\n\"The London Diamond league was a big one, that time really showed her that she has got the confidence to be quick,\" he said.\n\nAfter a so-so race in Monaco, Pearson arrived at the Australian team camp in Tonbridge with a clear understanding of what needed to be fixed in the next three weeks.\n\nShe also took her coach's hat off and delegated that to Hilliard and the team's hurdles coach Matt Beckenham.\n\n\"I needed some eyes,\" Pearson said. \"I needed to just be the athlete and listen to someone who I could put my trust in and get me through these world championships as a winner.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old arrived at the world championships as the third-fastest hurdler for the year behind world record-holder Kendra Harrison.\n\nShe wasn't happy with the time of her heat win but was a different person when she returned eight hours later for the semi-final and ran 12.53sec to be the fastest qualifier through to the final.\n\nThe world title race was typical Pearson. Her guts, determination and experience came to the fore while her more fancied rivals floundered around her.\n\nHilliard wasn't surprised.\n\n\"She's like Cathy Freeman, she finds another 10 per cent,\" he said. \"She's just a classic athlete who finds another level. When the bar is raised, she finds it.''\n\nPearson admitted afterwards she'd always thought a second world title -- her first was in 2011 -- was possible.\n\n\"From the first day I started training I knew it was possible, I knew I could get here,\" she said. \"I remember someone saying, 'You can be the world champion again' and I didn't feel awkward about that.\n\n\"When I knew I felt that I knew it was in me to do it. If I don't feel that spark I know there's something wrong, but I felt it straight away.\"", "timeCrawl": "06:15:00", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8878494", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "id": 392, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "id": 485, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "id": 487, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "id": 824, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "id": 1249, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

After three lost years ruined by injury, Pearson has completed the most remarkable comeback to win gold at the London world championships and in doing so has been elevated among the greatest Australian athletes ever.\n\nPearson now stands alongside Catherine Freeman as one of Australia's best modern track athletes after adding a second world championship gold to a silver in Moscow and her Olympic gold and silver.\n\nThis victory, she admits, is as sweet as any after the journey she has undertaken to get here - four years lost from major championships, putting aside the lesser Commonwealth Games, ruined by serious calf, Achilles and hamstring injuries as well as a wrist shattered in a fall.\n\nOn top of that she sacked her last coach and began coaching herself on the day the athletics began at the Rio Olympics last year and sat down in her Gold Coast home to write out a plan to get her back to the top of the world. Then on the eve of her 31st birthday she arrived in London as a relative outsider and won gold.\n\n\"Every single emotion that you can hold in your body just came out when I crossed that finish line. It wasn't surprise, it wasn't shock. I was just proud, so proud of what I had done to get here,\" she said after winning the gold in 12.59s.\n\n\u1f1e6\u1f1fa IT'S A FAIRYTALE. @sallypearson, 5 years after London Olympic \u1f947, and years of injuries, is back on top of the world #BeTheNextpic.twitter.com/uNXm51AihF -- IAAF World Champs (@IAAFWorldChamps)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\n\"From the first day I started training I knew it was possible, I knew I could get here and I remember someone saying 'you can be the world champion again' and I didn't feel awkward about that. When I knew I felt that, I knew it was in me to do it.\"\n\nHer outsider, or challenger, status here made it feel a little sweeter than when she won her first world championship in Daegu six years ago.\n\n\"I think so, I went to Daegu and I was winning, right from a year out I was going to win the world championships,\" she said\n\n\"Every medal is different and this one sure is very different to the rest of them.\"\n\nA happy little vegemite with her 100m hurdles gold medal. Congrats @sallypearson! #TeamAUSpic.twitter.com/6O9dL1rw8U -- Athletics Australia (@AthsAust)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nPearson's success preceded a heartbreaking end to the career of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympic champion appearing to strain a hamstring in the final leg of the men's 4x100m relay. He failed to finish and Great Britain won gold.\n\nAfter taking the baton from his teammate Yohan Blake, Bolt began to gather speed only to pull up and shout in pain about 60m from the finish line.\n\nIt was hardly the farewell party that Bolt, the greatest sprinter in history, had in mind when he decided to make this meet the last of his career.\n\nHis injury - later confirmed as severe cramp - would normally have cast a pall over the rest of the race, but it has been a frustrating meet for Britain, the host country. And with Bolt on the ground and the Jamaicans out of contention, the gold came down to a sprint for the finish between Christian Coleman of the United States and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake of Britain.\n\nBritain won by 0.05 seconds, finishing in 37.47 seconds to the Americans' 37.52. As the official results flashed on the big screen, the crowd cheered wildly for Britain's second gold medal of these championships.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolt's teammates rushed to help him as he lay on the track.\n\nWith AAP", "timeCrawl": "23:41:00", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 1844, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1859}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8854943", "categories": [], "details": {}}

time had a peek at life on the other side.\n\nAnd she didn't mind it with Pearson and her husband, Kieran, enjoying a skiing holiday to New Zealand with friends, something she'd never been able to do previously.\n\nA broken wrist had forced her out of the 2015 world championships and then a combination of hamstring and achilles problems had meant she wasn't defending her Olympic crown in Rio.\n\nIt was the classic crossroads moment.\n\nPearson decided to push reverse and go back into the world she'd known for the previous 13 years but there was one significant difference ... she was going to do it by herself.\n\nThe history of self-coached athletes at the elite level isn't great but the queen of Australian athletics figured there was no one more capable of lighting the fire again than herself.\n\nFast forward 12 months and Pearson is back in the stadium where she had her greatest triumph.\n\nAnd she's not just making up the numbers with the 2011 world champion coming in as the third-fastest hurdler in the world this year.\n\nPearson, 30, served notice that she was back as a force at last month's London Diamond League meet where she ran 12.48 sec.\n\n\"Most definitely (I had doubts),\" she said.\n\n\"The only reason I came back was because I knew I had more to give, obviously deep down I knew I was capable of doing it.\n\n\"It was more the disappointment that got me down and made me think maybe I shouldn't be doing this anymore, maybe my body can't handle it.\n\n\"But even deeper down I knew I could still do it if I just looked after myself properly and listened to my body and stayed injury-free.\"\n\nPearson admits she didn't know what to expect with the self-coaching but had been pleasantly surprised with how easily she'd adjusted.\n\n\"I know what works for me and it's just a matter of getting your body to do that, listening to it,\" she said.\n\n\"It is five years older than London now but it's just a matter of knowing your body and understanding what you do and what you don't do and also what you do have to do and not have to do anymore.\n\n\"That was the big learning curve and it was very slow to start off with.\n\n\"The hardest part has been the competitions, trying to keep yourself up ... keeping the athletes hat on and being positive that if you keep doing what you're doing then it will be all right.\n\n\"Figuring out when to be an athlete and when to be a coach has been the toughest thing.\"\n\nAustralian team head coach Craig Hilliard had no doubt his best performer would be able to make the transition to self-coaching.\n\n\"I am a true believer that if you have been with an effective coach and in the sport a long time to achieve what she achieved then the athlete, if they have any nous about them, should be able to coach

-- Ramil Guliyev, representing Turkey after switching allegiance from Azerbaijan, pulled off a shock 200 meters victory at the World Championships on Thursday, edging an emotional favorite Wayde van Niekerk into second place in a blanket finish.\n\nThe 27-year-old Guliyev, who had never won a medal in a senior global event, finished just the stronger to triumph in 20.09 seconds before setting off on a lap of honor carrying the flags of both of his nations.\n\nSouth African Van Niekerk, who took the 400m title on Tuesday, had been seeking to match American Michael Johnson's achievement of doing the 200/400m double at the Gothenburg worlds in 1995, but had to settle for silver in 20.11 seconds.\n\nJereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago was given the same time but was relegated to third by one thousandth of a second. Isaac Makwala of Botswana, the crowd favorite after his illness travails initially saw him barred from competing this week, started strongly but faded to sixth.\n\nIn the absence of Usain Bolt, who had won the event in the last four championships, it always looked a wide open race, but even with the most level playing field for a decade, few were looking at lane five for the likely winner. Van Niekerk, Makwala, Richards and US duo Isiah Young and Ameer Webb all looked stronger on paper, while the home crowd also focused on local favorite Nathaneel Mitchell-Blake, who eventually came through for fourth.\n\nThose with a keen athletics eye might point to the fact that Guliyev's junior best is second only to Bolt's but, after a decade of minor medals in minor championships, and at the age of 27, his chances of global gold looked slim to say the least.\n\nGuliyev, who became a Turkish citizen in 2011 and was cleared to represent his new country in 2013, did fire out a warning in the semifinals when he won his heat ahead of Webb and Van Niekerk and, though he slipped into the final pretty much under the radar, he had been confident all along..\"\n\nA choked-up Van Niekerk could barely speak and was upset by what he said was a lack of respect for his 400m victory. \"It was a tough week, there were a lot of people who felt I didn't deserve it,\" he said.\n\nAmerican Kori Carter pulled off another of the growing number of shocks at the World Championships on Thursday, achieving the rare feat of winning the 400 meters hurdles title from the outside lane. All eyes had been on Carter's US teammate, Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, who had been the strong favorite, but it was the former American champion in lane nine who maintained her form best to race to victory in 53.07 seconds.\n\nMuhammad, the fastest woman in the world this year, earned the silver in 53.50 to complete an American one-two while Jamaican Ristananna Tracey, an Olympic finalist last year, took the bronze in a lifetime best 53.74.\n\nCzech Zuzana Hejnova, who had been seeking to achieve an unprecedented third successive one-lap hurdles victory, had to settle for fourth, being overhauled by Tracey on the run-in despite clocking a season's best 54.20.\n\nDouble Olympic champion Christian Taylor continued his dominance of the triple jump when he won his third world title on Thursday, once again beating fellow American Will Claye into second place.\n\nTaylor leapt 17.68 meters with his third attempt to win by five centimeters, clinching the title when Claye was given a red flag on his last attempt. Portugal's Nelson Evora, Olympic champion in 2008, took bronze with 17.19.\n\nThe 27-year-old Taylor became the first triple jumper to win three world crowns, having also claimed victory in Daegu in 2011 and Beijing two years ago. He also took gold at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics with Claye finishing second on both occasions. But he had made it clear beforehand that his ambition was to break Jonathan Edwards's long-standing record of 18.29 meters, set in 1995.\n\n\"I have this watch from my sponsor with 18.30 on it,\" Taylor said. \"I will try to fight, I will get this number. The record is still on. I am still motivated to break that record. My motivation is to be the best athlete. This was not the night, I am a little disappointed. But the season is not yet over.\"\n\nEdwards said beforehand that he thought his world mark could be under threat. In the event, the contest turned into something of an anti-climax with both producing their best jumps in the third round.\n\nDouble Olympic champion Sandra Perkovic looks set to land a second world title to go with her global collection as she dominated qualifying in the discus on Friday.\n\nAfter an initial no-throw, the Croatian launched a huge second round throw of 69.67 meters, an effort that only she has bettered this year, to lead the qualifiers into Sunday's final.\n\nBack in the stadium where she won Olympic gold in 2012, Perkovic's effort was more than four meters longer than the next best, the 65.58m recorded by Cuban champion Yaime Perez. An even more relieved thrower was Cuba's other major medal hope, reigning world champion Denia Caballero, who was on the verge of elimination before surpassing the automatic qualifying mark of 62.50m with her final attempt of 63.79.\n\nAustralia's 2012 Olympic champion Sally Pearson's bid to put behind her two years of injury hell started well on Friday as she coasted into the 100 meters hurdles semifinals. The 30-year-old -- the 2011 world champion -- missed both the 2015 world championships and 2016 Olympics because of serious injuries, losing out on the former after suffering a \"bone explosion\" in her wrist in a terrible fall at a meet.\n\nThe perils of this event were evident in the heats when Trinidadian Deborah John crashed into the fifth obstacle requiring medical attention for over 10 minutes before being fitted with a neck brace and stretchered off the track.\n\nPearson looked in determined mood right from the outset, dominating her heat to take it in 12.71sec from America's 2008 Olympic champion Dawn Harper-Nelson.\n\nPearson will reappear later on Friday for the semifinals where she will face stiffer opposition and be able to measure herself against American world record holder Kendra Harrison.\n\nHarrison looked good in her heat as she flew from the blocks and crossed the line clear in 12.60sec, with Belarus's 2015 world bronze medalist Alina Talay edging Jamaica's former world youth champion Yanique Thompson for second.\n\nDefending champion Danielle Williams looked silky smooth in her heat, the Jamaican gliding over the hurdles to win in 12.66sec ahead of promising German champion Pamela Dutkiewicz.\n\nFour Kenyans with eyes on 1,500 meters medals -- the three fastest men in the world this year and the one seeking a fourth successive title -- all qualified from Thursday's first-round heats, though not without a scare for one of them.\n\nTriple defending champion Abel Kiprop, aiming to match the four successive titles world record-holder Hicham El Guerrouj took from 1997-2003, showed that he is not about to hand over his title without a fight.\n\nKiprop went all the way to the line just behind Elijah Manangoi, silver medalist two years ago and the world leader this year with three minutes 28.80, in a mass finish to the first heat.\n\nThe two 21-year-old pretenders of the Kenyan team had contrasting nights as Timothy Cheruiyot went through strongly in second place in the third heat while Ronald Kwemoi snatched the sixth and last fast-loser slot.\n\nSadik Mikhou, who switched allegiance from Morocco to Bahrain last year, was an impressive winner of the second heat, where Dutchman Richard Douma fell 30 meters from the line when well-placed to qualify. After an appeal by the Dutch federation Douma was advanced to the semifinals.\n\nLuke Mathews of Australia led the last heat home and it was considerably the fastest of the three with the six automatic and five of the six fast losers all going through from it. -- Reuters", "timeCrawl": "03:15:00", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8737056", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "id": 145, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "id": 256, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World_Building", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World Building", "id": 766, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

However, nobody expected what was to happen.\n\nPearson won her heat in a fast 12.53 seconds to relegate the United States' Nia Ali, 12.79, to the second automatic qualifying spot, while Netherlands heptathlete, Nadine Visser, 12.83, edged Jamaica's Megan Simmonds, 12.93, to third.\n\nSimmonds was on the bubble, but was to be run out of a non-automatic spot in the very next race, as Jamaica's Yanique Thompson finished third in 12.88, to briefly hold the last spot.\n\nBut that wasn't the story of the second heat, as defending World champion Danielle Williams of Jamaica crashed into the first hurdle and never recovered, knocking almost every other hurdle to finish fifth in a pedantic 13.14.\n\nThe United States' Christina Manning got out early and controlled the race to win in a more conservative 12.71, while Belarus' Alina Talay ran a season's best 12.85 to finish second for the second automatic qualifier.\n\nThe Jamaicans had one more chance to have an automatic qualifier in the final.

of the busted flush which was Australia's results at the world swimming and athletics championships this year, the Gold Coaster gave April's Games a leading light, a guiding star.\n\nThese are now in prospect Pearson's Commonwealth Games in the same way that for years beforehand the 2000 Sydney Olympics had Cathy Freeman, world champion in 1997 and 1999, as its central local figure.\n\nPearson cleared 10 hurdles in winning her second 100m world final, but the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games vaulted a bigger one in being handed a focus for Australians to become excited about the event.\n\nFor Pearson, for several months an official Games ambassador, to run a good race in the London final and maybe win a medal, which was bluntly where she was at three weeks before the world championships, would have been one thing.\n\nTo come out of a comeback clouded by such uncertainty about her physical capacities and become, like Freeman and Jana Pittman, a dual world champion gives the Commonwealth Games a reigning Australian world champion with a well-known life story.\n\nShe won the final yesterday in a fashion that has been the template of her career. She came out of the blocks in front, put on a hurdles clinic - her technique having been honed with her first coach Sharon Hannan - and kept her focus when the field came at her in the last couple of hurdles.\n\nPearson has been a racer all her athletics career, willing to compete seriously in sometimes multiple events at domestic meets which lesser Australian athletes have turned their nose up at.\n\nThe self-coached Queenslander won the final yesterday as the best racer in the field.\n\nPearson first came into focus in national athletics in 2001 as 14-year-old Sally McLellan, when she turned down the chance to represent Australia in an open 4x100m relay in New Zealand, preferring instead to compete in Little Athletics.\n\nAt 16, she won a world youth championships gold medal in the 100m hurdles in Sherbrooke, Canada. A skinny Jamaican named Usain Bolt won his 200m final at the same meet.\n\nFourteen years later, Bolt has finally run his race. Pearson intends to race on to the Gold Coast and even further.\n\nIn Canada in 2003 she rubbed shoulders with onlooking athletics legends Jackie Joyner Kersee and Michael Johnson with the same confident, no-nonsense mindset that she carried through her biggest tests in her sport.\n\n\"When they spoke about their experiences in the sport when they were younger, it was like: 'Wow, I'm going through what they went through' and I'd love to be as good as them,'' she told The Courier-Mail in 2003.\n\nThe game-for-anything Gold Coaster has one late present to give her home city.", "timeCrawl": "12:33:00", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8914685", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "id": 742, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

She hit the first hurdle in her semi and was dumped to the back of the field. She recovered her balance and a lunge at the line pinched third place and squeezed her into the last place of the qualifiers.\n\nHarrison has been placed in lane two, next to Pearson in lane three, for the final which will be at 5.05am Sunday, Australian time.\n\nHarrison is the world record holder but has not won a major championship. Pearson has the knowledge that, like Dawn Harper-Nelson, the 2008 Olympic gold medallist who won silver behind Pearson in the 2012 Olympics, she is a performer in big championship moments.\n\n\"It's nice to go into the final the fastest but I know what these girls can do and I have to be fair on myself and know where I have come from and know what these girls can do as well,\" Pearson said.\n\n\"I am running against the world record holder; you can't disregard that at all, that is a very important marker but at the same time no one goes onto the track to come second and we all know what hurdles can do and at the moment I think I am the most consistent one out there.\"\n\nHarrison so very nearly wasn't out there. \"I had to tell myself not to panic .. I've run the world record in this stadium so I was capable of making up for the error. I didn't hurt myself so I'm fine,\" Harrison said.\n\n\"I can't worry about one performance.

She is confident in her ability at the moment, she is in a really good space and her warm-up yesterday was fantastic so she's ready to go.\n\n\"Go back and watch any of her runs, the London Diamond League and any of her previous major championship performances, Sally is a major championships performer, that is what she has got going for her, so they should fear Sally\n\n\"I think she can (get amongst them), absolutely and more importantly Sally believes she can.\"\n\nThe last comment is the most poignant, for self-belief is critical even in an athlete such as Sally.\n\nHer turning point on this road back from injury most fundamentally came when she ran well in London and realised she was not kidding herself - she was quick again.\n\nThe first key moment came when she parted with her previous coach. When as a coach you inherit an athlete such as Sally the temptation is to prove your value by making changes, but Sally was understood to feel she was making changes for changes' sake.\n\nSo she sacked the coach and did her own thing. She realised that after more than a decade in the sport she did not need someone else to help her get fit, she could do that on her own.\n\nThe gulf between how Sally trains and how other Aussie athletes - or athletes from anywhere really - train is clear when you watch Sally out on the track. She works incredibly hard.\n\nShe just needed someone else at certain moments to cast a critical eye over her technique in getting over the hurdles.\n\nSo she worked with Hilliard on getting the right people around her as a sounding board when it came to the technical part of her racing.\n\nShe liked the arrangement, she was a mature woman taking charge. She trusted those advising on her technical run and she trusted herself to be fit. And she is fit.\n\nIs she fit enough or fast enough? That will be tested on Friday, but the evidence suggests she is back where she was. Will that be fast enough against the world's best? Sally is not sure either, but she is more confident now than any time over the past three years.\n\n\"I'm here and I'm healthy, I'm fast, I'm fit and I'm strong ... probably just as strong as I have been when I've been at my best,\" Pearson said.", "timeCrawl": "01:36:00", "sim": 0.3725490272045135, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8302371", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "id": 385, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "id": 562, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "id": 824, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "id": 1028, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

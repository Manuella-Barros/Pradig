Famous for their faux-feud sparring on social media \u2014 and primed to take over the summer movie season with their bombastic, R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine \u2014 off-screen, the witty duo\u2019s real-life friendship is profound. \u201cWe rely on each other for the real kind of advice that you want,\u201d Reynolds says in this week\u2019s cover story, which marks PEOPLE's first-ever collectible side-by-side covers featuring both stars. On July 26, their 17-year bond culminates in the third installment of Reynolds\u2019 raucous franchise, and the first project to reunite Deadpool with Wolverine since the two first met on the set of Jackman\u2019s film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. (It also marks the first time Deadpool\u2019s raunchy shenanigans have entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe.) Inside the issue, on stands Friday, the two stars interview each other, opening up about how they offer one another rock-solid support while navigating impressive Hollywood careers, fatherhood and life\u2019s tougher moments. \"There's probably fewer friends in our life that you can say anything to, the stuff you're ashamed, embarrassed, anything,\u201d Jackman, 55, tells Reynolds, 47. \u201cAnd ever since I've known you, and I would say in particular in like the last five, 10 years, we've had more time where we go for our walks because you're an unbelievable listener,\" adds Jackman. \"So you can tell me anything and I can tell you anything, and I don't feel like you're going to be judging or necessarily giving me the answer: \u2018Do this.\u2019 And I think that has been the key.\u201d The feeling is mutual. \u201cI think the secret sauce to a long-lasting Hollywood friendship is not too dissimilar to having a partner or a marriage,\u201d says Reynolds, speaking to Jackman. \u201cI am genuinely rooting for you, all the time. I want you to win. It\u2019s the same way I feel about Blake. As I'm rooting for her, I know she's rooting for me, and it's why we're so connected.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Reynolds still hasn\u2019t forgotten the unexpected warmth he found back in 2008 when the two stars first met. The actor, who shares four kids with wife Lively, had arrived in Sydney as an unproven X-Men entity about to debut his rapid-patter take on Deadpool for the first time. The Jackman vehicle was the biggest film the actor had ever been in, and he\u2019d been hired just weeks before. Walking on set for the first time, \u201cI was blown away. And I was nervous as hell,\u201d recalls Reynolds. \u201cI was walking through the trailers, jet-lagged, disoriented, feeling really green and kind of out of my depth, and there was no script to look at. It was just like, what's going to happen?\u201d He continues: \u201cAnd I heard my name, \u2018Ryan!\u2019 in between these trailers as I was walking. And it was you. Just the fact that you knew my name meant so much to me. And you came over, you gave me a big hug and you said, \u2018Welcome aboard.\u2019 \u201d Cut to Deadpool & Wolverine. \u201cAnd I remember the first day of this [movie] and you came, and you did the same thing,\u201d grins Jackman. \u201cYou came over and you went, \"Steve!\" Reynolds adds with a laugh, \u201cGreg? No, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d But watching Jackman operate on that early set, says Reynolds, ultimately taught him what it meant to lead \u2014 and how to pay kindness forward, particularly in how the Wolverine star is inherently gracious to \u201cnot just the people that can change your destiny, but everybody.\u201d Still, for Deadpool & Wolverine Reynolds had to persuade Jackman to revive the X-Men character that he\u2019d firmly put to bed with 2017\u2019s critically acclaimed Logan.

The role represented both existential challenges (Reynolds had to figure out how the film would make sense for fans who had said goodbye to the beloved character) and physical demands, with Jackman committing to an intense exercise regimen. \u201cI had got to the point probably 10 years ago I was like, I'm not enjoying it. It was hurting. It was tough,\" Jackman says. \u201cBut I've had a break, and I've been doing a lot of dance. I've been doing stage shows. And so when I came back to it, it was really fun.\u201d Reynolds would come to marvel at Jackman\u2019s commitment to hitting his mark. \u201cWhen Hugh Jackman is coming at you at 150 Australian miles per hour, you feel like there's no way you're not going to be dead in four seconds,\u201d notes Reynolds. \u201cAnd I will never forget that. And thank God I'm in a mask, because under the mask my face is going, 'Oh God!'\"", "summary": "Reynolds says his 17-year friendship with Jackman is like his marriage to Blake Lively in one key way", "url": "https://people.com/ryan-reynolds-hugh-jackman-secret-sauce-friendship-exclusive-8654857", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/-D-NDHEdEavNhH3q8VHpE9eW-F0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/hugh-jackman-ryan-reynolds-people-8-8258a9fe4936411fbba6b0b5d2dc6b79.jpg", "video": "https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/1PEoTCkm-zMCebKN4.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:00", "author": "Andrea Mandell", "authors": ["Andrea Mandell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.342}

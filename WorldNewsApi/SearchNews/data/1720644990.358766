The heart of the fragrance bursts with vibrant orange flower, adding an invigorating and uplifting energy and a final touch of sun kissed woods lingers, creating a warm and lasting impression. The limited edition scent, which is easy to take through the airport thanks to its convenient 90ml spray bottle, can be used on both the body and hair. To use, simply spritz from head to toe\u2014anytime and anywhere.

Those who use the discount code FIRST15 can get \u00a33.60 off the fragrance mist, bringing the total down to just \u00a320.40. While the Sol De Janeiro Limited Edition Summer E Amor Perfume Mist 90ml has only one review at Space NK, the fragrance has an overall rating of 4.3 out of five from almost 370 reviews at Sephora. One shopper said: \"This is an amazing Sol de Janeiro scent. I get compliments all the time from this smell. It kind of smells like the 68 perfume with some more floral scents. An overall great product, will be repurchasing.\" A second wrote: \" This is going to be my-go to body spray for the summer. I\u2019ve already been obsessed with the original Sol De Janeiro scent since it first launched so when I was gifted the Summer De Amor body spray I fell fast for this romantic spin on the classic fragrance. \"Think of a more warm amber and woodsy spin on the signature bum bum cream scent. Soft yet romantic. I do find I need to reapply this spray, however that is to be expected because it is a body spray not a perfume.\" A third penned: \"I am obsessed with this scent. It's light and not overpowering, the perfect scent for summer. I love the colour of the bottle and the size is perfect to throw in my bag for a nice refresh. I've also gotten so many compliments on it.\" \"This is for the girlies that don't want too much of a sweet and fruity scent for summer,\" mentioned another. \"The notes do bring cheerful summer vibes, though. I find the staying power to be fitting for a body mist. It'll last a few hours and give you a subtle scent in a few sprays.\" However, one beauty buff gave the Summer E Amor Perfume Mist a three-star review because it 'smells like 62 but not as good'. They wrote: \"It smells good but I don\u2019t find it to be anything special. In my opinion it smells really similar to 62, but slightly more floral. I find that weird because they have no similar notes, but they smell very alike.\" But another loved their latest fragrance purchase, adding: \"I get so many compliments wearing Summer e Amor body/hair mist. It is such a beautiful floral citrus gourmand scent. It opens up with strong almond and tangerine notes, and it evolves into a beautiful creamy vanilla, amber-y close to the skin scent. I get a little bit of florals in the opening but not too much. I think it smells a little like a marzipan. It is beautifully balanced and I think it\u2019s suitable to be worn all year round. I hope it won\u2019t be discontinued. The longevity is great, my hair smells amazing the next day.\" Alternatively, shoppers can pick up a set of body mists from So...? on Amazon for around the same price point. Typically costing \u00a324.99, the Summer Escapes Body Mist Fragrance Bundle (pack of three) is available for \u00a317.99. The Hawaiian Tropic Aloha Coco Shimmer Edition Body Mist 250ml, which costs \u00a39.89 on Amazon, is also a great option for summer.", "summary": "&quot;I get so many compliments wearing this fragrance mist.

{"id": 243323444, "title": "Why is Hong Kong&#8217;s largest press group once again in the government&#8217;s crosshairs?", "text": "What is it, one wonders, about Secretary for Security Chris Tang and the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA)? Tang, after all, has a lot on his plate. He is responsible for repelling every threat to peace, order and national security in Hong Kong. The latter, we are often told, needs constant alertness and attention. Yet it seems Tang is never too busy to have a go at the HKJA. The HKJA is a small voluntary body aiming to serve and protect the interests of people working in journalism. It does the usual things: seminars, workshops, occasional dinners and the odd press release on relevant matters. It sometimes runs a football competition. Let me declare, if this counts as an interest, that I was a member for many years. When I first arrived in Hong Kong the HKJA was a bit of an expat hobby. It was founded by two foreigners in the 1970s after a scandalous incident in which the fire brigade \u2013 which in those days, like the police force and for similar reasons, did not welcome press coverage \u2013 turned its hoses on the reporters assembled to watch a performance. In those days people arriving to work in the humbler parts of Hong Kong journalism \u2013 I had been recruited by The Standard \u2013 did not join the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club, which regarded people merely writing for local consumption as peasants. You joined the HKJA for the serious stuff and the Press Club for fun. The Press Club ran a Wan Chai bar situated beguilingly between a night club where frustrated rich men could meet mercenary fast ladies, and a motel in which the ensuing relationships could be consummated. Once a year, the HKJA and the Press Club jointly organised a ball, which was what you might call a colourful occasion, both in dress and behaviour. During the 1980s there was a growing culture clash between the two organisations, which led to the HKJA dropping out of the ball and running its own annual fundraising dinner, a more respectable event. The Press Club was rescued from its continuing flirtation with bankruptcy by an unfrocked accountant called Len Dreaver and eventually dropped the ball. The club closed altogether in 1997 because so many members had left Hong Kong. After that the HKJA was really the only game in town, unless you could afford the FCC and had a taste for its somewhat expat alcoholic ambience. During the ensuing 20 years or so I do not remember any particular tension between the HKJA and the security branch. There was a period in which I was regularly recruited to do a session on media relations with officers approaching promotion; after each session we of course had some open discussion, and this often featured complaints about inaccurate or intrusive reporting. I imagine in most places with a free press you would get the same sort of thing. We would then go on to laments about the absence of a complaint mechanism for people upset about their treatment by the media, to which I would reply that we would be quite happy to have a complaints procedure as long as it was modelled on the police one. This was all good clean fun and embodied the common-sense truism that the relationship between press and police will always involve some conflict because the objectives of the two groups sometimes coincide and sometimes don\u2019t. This brings us to 2019 when relations understandably became a bit strained. Tang was then in charge of the police. The HKJA, like any journalists\u2019 union worthy of the name, eagerly pressed for access to events and against violence inflicted on its members. Since that time Tang has resoundingly condemned the association and all its works on several occasions, questioning who it represents, who it gets its money from and whether it should be invited to press conferences on relevant matters. He has accused it of \u201cinfiltrating schools\u201d and defending people who swore at policewomen. At one point he suggested the association should publicise its entire membership list, a curious suggestion from a government which condemned the publication of national security judges\u2019 mere names as \u201cdoxxing\u201d. This barrage gave the understandable impression, in the context of the times, that the HKJA was expected either to disband itself, like the Professional Teachers Union, or elect a more \u201cpatriotic\u201d \u2013 or more tactfully \u201cneutral\u201d \u2013 leadership, like the Hong Kong Bar Association. And so to last Friday, a day ahead of elections for new HKJA leadership, and Tang rose to the occasion with: \u201cLooking at [the list of candidates], it looks more like a foreign journalist association to me. Most of them are journalists from foreign media, some are freelancers, some are not even journalists and their organisations have engaged in political activities.\u201d Mr Tang was disturbed that the executive was light on representatives from local mainstream media. Actually this has always been a problem, if it is a problem. Many mainstream media proprietors are violently opposed to trade unions generally and particularly to trade unions which seek to represent their employees. The HKJA leadership has consequently always been a bit overweight on the non-profit-making parts of the media business, like RTHK, and underweight on major media groups in private ownership. Insert the usual suspects here. One must add that over the last five years or so the mainstream media have much diminished, and are now heavily outnumbered by the directly or indirectly state-owned sector, and the voluntary castrato chorus whose owners like a quiet life. Many journalists who are still trying to pursue the activity in its traditional form may now feel that their lives are exciting enough without accepting office in an organisation which is clearly in the government\u2019s crosshairs. In fact two members of the executive put in their resignations between the end of nominations and the counting of the votes. Still, the question of who is a journalist seems to be one about which one can think of more reliable sources than Tang. English journalist Bernard Levin memorably pondered in one piece whether journalism was an art, a craft, a trade, a confidence trick or a disease. Each of these theories would lead to a different definition but none of them supports the suggestion that entry to the profession should be monitored by a retired policeman. What seems to me worthy of comment and universally overlooked is that Tang\u2019s preoccupation with the HKJA has apparently led to spying on it. No doubt the identities of the candidates and their professional activities were transmitted to voters. But Tang is, I presume, not an HKJA member so he was not entitled to see them. Commenting on the antecedents and character of the candidates looks dangerously close to the sort of intimidating letter which concludes with some such phrase as \u201cwe know where you live\u201d. So, I salute the incoming executive, who are no doubt well aware that one misstep could bring them a long encounter with the government\u2019s correctional servants. As Sophie Scholl wrote: \u201cHow can we expect righteousness to prevail if there is hardly anyone willing to give himself up individually to a righteous cause?\u201d All HKFP staff are members of the HKJA, and reporter Hans Tse is a member of the 2024-25 Executive Committee.

The Indianapolis Colts have so many routes they could go in this draft that it is almost nauseating to go through each and every scenario. So today, I simply wanted to lay out my thoughts on a few of the draft's biggest talking points for this team.\n\nThis isn't a predictive piece by any means, but it is how I would view the biggest topics for the Colts going into this Thursday.\n\nGeneral manager Chris Ballard has been quite clear in his draft process throughout his career. He is a firm believer in stockpiling draft picks to have more shots to find talent, and this is a mindset that has been backed up for years by countless studies of the data. Ballard had this to say about his philosophy of adding more picks to the arsenal come draft day:\n\nI just go off history. The more picks you have, the better chance you have to hit. Now, of course you're not going to hit on all of them but it gives you more of a chance to hit.\n\nThe hubris of the NFL Draft is believing that a player will hit purely because the scouting report is positive. There are dozens of factors that go into whether a player will be successful in the NFL or not, and sometimes the likelihood of a player hitting comes down to random chance or circumstance. Ballard and many other GMs understand that the best way to mitigate the risk of the draft is by having more shots at acquiring talent.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean the Colts won't trade up in the draft. Ballard and the Colts have made several trade-ups in the past, but it has to be for a player who checks every single box and for a pick that doesn't cost too much in draft capital. The Colts have made just two trade-ups in the top 50 of the draft in Ballard's career, and the most that he has moved up in those trades is three selections. His move from the 44th overall pick to the 41st overall pick in the 2020 draft cost him just a fifth-round selection.\n\nSo, when it comes to trading up in this draft, it isn't completely out of the question. If a player like Brock Bowers or Dallas Turner (for instance) are on the board at pick 13 and the Colts get a sense another team might try to jump up for one of them, then Ballard could send a fourth-round selection or something to move up. Ultimately though, that is not his draft philosophy.\n\nRegardless of personal feelings on this strategy, it is simply how the Colts operate. Maybe a playmaker in this draft makes them stray away from it, but the odds of that seem exceedingly low. When people tell you who they are, believe them. Ballard has been very upfront about this strategy, so there is no reason to doubt him when he says, \"We'll probably move back\" in this draft. That simply is how he approaches the draft.\n\nEven if a trade up in round one seems unlikely, that doesn't mean the Colts won't have their eyes on some of the top playmakers in the class. The Colts draft slot at 15 is the prime spot to stop a player's slide, and there could be an ideal fit on the board with the potential of 4-5 quarterbacks going in the top 14 selections.\n\nAs for needs, the obvious ones are cornerback and safety. The Colts currently have the exact same starters at those positions going into next year, bringing back a secondary that struggled for a majority of last season. The Colts need to bring in some outside help, whether it's in the draft or after the draft, to fix those weaknesses.\n\nWide receiver is another interesting need to look at. The Colts were notoriously thin at the position last season, with almost every snap on offense going to the team's top three players on the depth chart. The Colts could elect to add a day one difference-maker early in the draft and relegate Alec Pierce to more of a reserve role, or add a niche player on day three to act as that reserve behind Pierce and the other starters.\n\nAs for other positions, the Colts have some future needs to consider. Both Will Fries and Ryan Kelly are set to be free agents after this upcoming season, so the team will certainly be in the offensive line market. Ballard mentioned the other day that, \"The o-line in this draft is really excellent, and there's depth throughout. I truly believe you're going to get a really good player in those mid rounds and even some later because of the depth of the group.\"\n\nDefensive end is another position of intrigue. Ballard has always prioritized spending high picks on the position, with 25% of his career top 100 selections being used on edge rushers. Dayo Odeyingbo is set to be a free agent after the season and Kwity Paye could potentially be one too with his fifth-year option decision coming up. Linebacker falls into this similar tier of need with E.J. Speed set to his free agency in 2025 as well.\n\nOverall, the only positions the Colts feel unlikely to take in this draft are quarterback and defensive tackle. They have their roster fairly set at those two spots, but anything else is up for grabs. For my money, I believe the Colts' top priority in this draft is to add a dynamic playmaker on offense early and then look at the additional needs following that selection. The day-two picks following that selection can really go in any order depending on how the draft board falls.\n\nBallard mentioned that the Colts have 19-21 first-round grades in this class in his pre-draft press conference last week. That number likely doesn't fully encompass how they divide players up within that group, but that does give a good indication of how they view the talent in this draft. That is a fairly high number and it could set the tone for how far the Colts would like to move back in round one to stay in range for a top player.\n\nUltimately, the players that I expect the team to be high on with the 15th pick are:\n\nBowers and Thomas are true difference makers on offense, albeit impacting the game in completely different ways. Bowers' elite ability after the catch and his ability to win over the middle of the field would cause problems for opposing defenses, and Thomas' elite ability in the vertical passing game is truly rare for a player of his size. Both players fit exactly what the team is looking for early in this draft.\n\nTurner is a bit raw of a pass rusher, but it is hard to ignore the pure talent he has on film. He is a special athlete that can wear multiple hats for a defense at the next level. He fits just about every single trait that the Colts look for in a pass rusher, and landing a top-10 talent at 15 would be the absolute dream scenario for the Colts.\n\nMitchell is an athletically gifted cornerback that has the makeup to fit what the Colts are looking for on the outside. He shined in zone coverage at the college level and his dominant Senior Bowl outing this year could be enough to push him over the edge on the Colts' board. Ballard was won over by Rock Ya-Sin's Senior Bowl back in 2019, so we could see a similar scenario happen here with Mitchell.\n\nAside from those top four players, I believe the Colts will be high on a player like Rome Odunze as well. Odunze's character, production, and athleticism fit everything that Ballard likes to see, but it seems unlikely that he will be even within striking range for the Colts in a draft day trade. He's one name to keep an eye on in a trade up, however.\n\nIn the event that the Colts look to trade back on draft day, there are several players that could fall into the Colts-type of player bucket:\n\nThere are certainly other names to consider depending on how far back the Colts move down in a potential trade-back, but these are the names that I personally have circled to watch for. As I've mentioned a few times in this piece already, the players that I'm focusing on are on the offensive side of the ball, so my focus is more on players like Bowers, Thomas, and Worthy rather than the other names on this list (at least at this moment).\n\nWhat happens next for the Colts? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our free newsletter and get breaking Colts news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nTwo players to keep an eye on this week are wide receiver Malik Nabers and edge rusher Laiatu Latu. Neither player has been mocked to the Colts much this offseason, but the team has done some extra work on both players. Now, that extra work doesn't mean they are gearing up to draft each player, but they have dug deeper into these two than expected (in my opinion).\n\nNabers is an interesting name, as some teams have him as high as the top receiver in the draft while others aren't particularly interested in the star pass catcher. There have been some draft leaks of late alluding to character concerns and he's also currently dealing with a shoulder injury that is a tad bit worrisome. The Colts had Nabers in for a visit, likely to recheck those two aspects on this talented player. It's unlikely he's available by the Colts' pick but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nLatu is arguably the best pass rusher in this draft class, but the 23-year-old edge rusher has a scary injury history. Some teams have Latu off their board entirely due to the neck injury that forced him to medically retire two years ago. The Colts are notoriously strict with their medical rechecks, so it remains to be seen how interested the Colts are in Latu. They have dug into his background and medicals quite a bit this draft season, however.\n\nBallard has struck gold in the past on day two picks for the Colts, landing All-Pro talents like Shaquille Leonard and Jonathan Taylor alongside strong starters Michael Pittman Jr., Bernhard Raimann, and Braden Smith in the coveted second day of the draft. Will he be able to hit a home run on day two again this year?\n\nHere are some notable players to keep an eye on for day two this year:\n\nAdisa Isaac, DE, Penn State: If the Colts miss out on an edge rusher on day one of the draft, Isaac is the logical day two target. Long arms, elite athleticism, and high upside with this former four star recruit.\n\nBen Sinnott, TE, Kansas State: Sinnott is a former fullback who moved to tight end for his final two seasons of play. Elite explosive scores and the positional flexibility that Shane Steichen wants at the position.\n\nXavier Legette, WR, South Carolina: Legette is a former high school quarterback that faced a lot of adversity at the college level. Late breakout player, but the Colts are bound to love his athleticism (and his perseverance throughout his career).\n\nRicky Pearsall, WR, Florida: Pearsall's hands and route running ability are among the best in the draft, and his relationship with Anthony Richardson could play its way into the draft room. Elite testing as well.\n\nMax Melton, CB, Rutgers: Melton is an inside-out cornerback prospect who possesses elite athleticism, ball skills, and length. He is a perfect fit for a zone-based system and would slide in well alongside JuJu Brents and Jaylon Jones.\n\nJaden Hicks, S, Washington State: Hicks is a former cornerback that made the transition out to safety for the Cougars. He is a fluid mover, a great tackler, and has the ability to play either safety spot. He also is just a redshirt sophomore in this class.\n\nBrandon Coleman, OT/IOL, TCU: A multi-year starter, Coleman hits the size and athletic thresholds the Colts look for at the position. His ability to play inside and out should be valuable to the Colts come draft day.\n\nTanor Bortolini, IOL, Wisconsin: Bortolini is an elite tester that declared early for this draft class. He is a polished pass protector with great speed on the perimeter in the run game. The Colts could surprise some and look at Bortolini in the third round as their long term option at center behind Ryan Kelly.\n\nDay three of the draft may just be an early look at the UDFA period, but the Colts have been able to find several contributors over the years on the third day of the draft. Notably, the Colts starting linebacker duo were both drafted on day three of their respective drafts and star nose tackle Grover Stewart was also found in the fourth round.\n\nHere are some notable players to keep an eye on for day two this year:\n\nTrey Taylor, S, Air Force: The Jim Thorpe award winner in 2023, Taylor has been criminally underrated in this draft cycle. He tested well, had a strong Shrine Bowl performance, and coaches at Air Force rave about him as a player and as a leader.\n\nTyrone Tracy Jr., RB, Purdue: A former wide receiver at Iowa, Tracy brings all the traits that Ballard loved in Nyheim Hines (in a much bigger player though). Tracy's versatility and big play tendencies would make him the perfect RB2 in Indy.\n\nLuke McCaffrey, WR, Rice: A former quarterback at Nebraska, McCaffrey made the successful transition to pass catcher at Rice. He stood out at the Senior Bowl, does the dirty work for an offense, and has upside as a multiple receiver spot backup in the NFL.\n\nTylan Grable, OT, UCF: A quarterback in high school, Grable transitioned to tight end and then to offensive tackle at Jacksonville State. He eventually made the jump up to UCF, starting two years for the team. He is a phenomenal athlete that checks a lot of boxes.\n\nJonah Laulu, IDL, Oklahoma: Laulu is an elite athlete that got stuck in the Sooners' rotation over the past few seasons. He has fantastic traits, but is a bit raw at the moment. The Colts could look at him anywhere from round five-UDFA period.\n\nElijah Jones, CB, Boston College: Jones is a battle-tested press man cornerback with great length and explosion. He is a bit slim compared to what the Colts typically like, but his upside in coverage could be worth a shot on day three.\n\nBlake Watson, RB, Memphis: A former wide receiver, Watson is a big play machine who could wear multiple hats for a team. Similarly to Tracy above, he would be the ideal day-three back for the Colts in this draft.\n\nLorenzo Thompson, OT, Rhode Island: A towering offensive tackle prospect, Thompson turned some heads this draft season with his highlights on film and strong testing numbers. The Colts should certainly be interested in this long time starter this draft season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Colts own seven total picks in the seven-round draft.\n\nAll rounds will be televised on ESPN/ABC and NFL Network and in Spanish on ESPN Deportes.\n\n* Head coach: Shane Steichen (second season with team)\n\n* General manager: Chris Ballard (eighth season with team)\n\n* Last year's record: 9-8\n\nThe Colts are coming off a promising first season under Steichen, who helped the team remain competitive despite a litany of key absences, including dual-threat rookie QB Anthony Richardson. The new face of the franchise missed one game due to a concussion and sustained a season-ending AC joint sprain in Week 5. Indianapolis weathered the storm and fell one win short of winning the AFC South behind backup QB Gardner Minshew, who is now with the Las Vegas Raiders. The expectations are high for Steichen and Richardson in Year 2 as they continue pushing Indianapolis into a new era.\n\nNote: Safety is a big need. However, the Colts don't seem likely to draft one on Day 1 or 2 and will probably aim to sign a veteran or two in free agency.\n\nCornerback: Kenny Moore II, whom the Colts retained in free agency, is the only proven cornerback on Indianapolis' roster. He fell just short of being named second-team All-Pro in 2023. JuJu Brents, a 2023 second-round pick, showed promise with one interception, six passes defensed and one forced fumble in his rookie season, but he only appeared in nine games due to various injuries.\n\nAssuming Brents starts alongside Moore in 2024, that leaves one more starting spot open on the outside, and the Colts don't have strong options. Ballard remains high on 2023 seventh-round pick Jaylon Jones and Dallis Flowers, who went undrafted in 2022 and is recovering from a torn Achilles he sustained in 2023, but they're far from safe bets. Indianapolis should seek to upgrade at cornerback early in the draft or the latter stages of free agency.\n\nWide receiver: Michael Pittman Jr., who recently inked a three-year, $70 million extension with $46 million guaranteed, headlines this group. There's still some debate about whether he's a No. 1 receiver, but that argument no longer matters because the Colts believe he's their No. 1 receiver given the contract he just signed. Slot receiver Josh Downs, who had an impressive rookie season in 2023, and deep threat Alec Pierce round out the rest of Indianapolis' wide receiver room.\n\nThe team could still use another explosive playmaker at that position. LSU star Brian Thomas Jr., who tallied an FBS-high 17 receiving TDs last year, is the first wideout that comes to mind who could be in Indianapolis' range with the No. 15 pick. Obviously, there will be other options early in the draft, but the bottom line is Indianapolis should prioritize making Richardson's job as easy as possible by adding another premier target.\n\nEdge rusher: The Colts set the Indianapolis-era franchise record with 51 sacks last season. Defensive end Samson Ebukam, who joined the Colts last year via free agency, led the way with 9.5 sacks. Fellow defensive end Kwity Paye finished second with 8.5 sacks, but it's not exactly a no-brainer for Indianapolis to pick up the 2021 first-round pick's fifth-year option. The Colts have until May 2 to decide if they're willing to pay Paye $13.4 million in 2025. Ballard thinks Paye and 2021 draftmate Dayo Odeyingbo, who tallied eight sacks in 2023, took significant steps forward last year, though it's fair to wonder if they'll ever become elite pass rushers at this stage of their careers.\n\nIndianapolis had an NFL-low 15.7 blitz percentage in defensive coordinator Gus Bradley's second season with the team, and its 19.6 QB pressure percentage ranked 22nd in the NFL, per Pro Football Reference. It would be na\u00efve to expect Bradley to change his system, so the most realistic way to potentially improve the Colts' pass rush would be for Ballard to take another swing at selecting an difference-making edge rusher in the draft.\n\nFinal big board: 40 prospects who could fit positions of need\n\nDraft mailbag: Would GM Chris Ballard trade a haul for Marvin Harrison Jr.?\n\nNFL mock draft analysis: What Dane Brugler got right and where he might have gone wrong\n\nColts and 'The Beast': Dream picks, sleepers and fun facts about Indy's top targets\n\nColts 2024 NFL Draft big board: 15 targets to watch at WR, CB and more\n\nGM Chris Ballard likes Colts' young CBs, but are they good enough for him to bet on?\n\nColts 10-step offseason plan: Franchise tag Michael Pittman Jr., draft Brock Bowers\n\nExploring Colts' options at TE: Bank on Jelani Woods' development?

Other teams are just going to let Brock Bowers fall? He's not getting past the Colts.\n\n2023: QB Anthony Richardson, No. 4 -- Limited to four games as a rookie, Richardson completed 59.5 percent of his passes for three TDs against one pick. He also tallied 25 carries for 136 yards and four touchdowns against one lost fumble. Richardson, who turns 22 in May, became the youngest player in NFL history with multiple passing TDs and a rushing TD in one game with his three-touchdown performance in an overtime loss against the Rams in Week 4. Despite the defeat, Ballard and Steichen both said the game validated Richardson's star potential. The dynamic QB will now be tasked with trying to end Indianapolis' three-year playoff drought in 2024.\n\n2022: WR Alec Pierce, No. 53 -- Pierce took a step back from his rookie season and finished with 32 catches for 514 yards and two TDs in 2023. The receiver's regression was due, in large part, to the Colts' inability to push the ball downfield when Minshew replaced Richardson at QB. One could argue Downs, who corralled a rookie franchise record 68 catches for 771 yards and two TDs, has emerged as the Colts' clear No. 2 wideout. However, Ballard still thinks Pierce is a more dynamic than what he's shown, and he should have the chance to display more of his abilities with a healthy Richardson in 2024.\n\n2021: DE Kwity Paye, No. 21 -- Paye produced his best and healthiest season as a pro in 2023. He totaled a career-high 8.5 sacks in 16 games, which was up from six sacks in 12 games in 2022 and four sacks in 15 games in 2021. The irony in Paye increasing his sacks last year is that he didn't put a lot of pressure on the QB otherwise. He had just six QB hurries, and his nine QB hits were a career low. Paye has proven he is a good player, but the question now is whether or not he can become a game-changer.\n\n2020: WR Michael Pittman Jr., No. 34 -- Pittman put together a career year in 2023, totaling 109 catches for 1,152 yards and four TDs. He became the fourth player in Colts history to record at least 100 catches and 1,000 receiving yards in a single season, joining Indianapolis wide receivers coach Reggie Wayne, Pro Football Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison Sr. and former tight end Dallas Clark.\n\nPittman took over as the Colts' No. 1 receiver after his rookie season, and he's totaled 296 receptions for 3,159 yards and 14 TDs over the last three years. The 26-year-old only missed two games during that span, and his availability and production are why Indianapolis had no choice but to sign him to a lucrative contract extension this offseason. The only wide receivers who've tallied more catches and targets (426) throughout the last three seasons are Las Vegas' Davante Adams, Miami's Tyreek Hill, Buffalo's Stefon Diggs, Minnesota's Justin Jefferson, Dallas' CeeDee Lamb and Detroit's Amon-Ra St. Brown, all of whom have been named first-team All-Pros.\n\n2019: CB Rock Ya-Sin, No. 34 -- Ya-Sin is one of Ballard's biggest draft misses. He started 13 games as a rookie and recorded one interception and five passes defensed, but he never became a full-time starter. After pedestrian campaigns in 2020 and 2021, Indianapolis traded Ya-Sin to the Raiders before the 2022 season in exchange for defensive end Yannick Ngakoue. Ya-Sin was serviceable in Las Vegas, starting nine of the 11 games he played that year, before signing a one-year, $4 million deal with Baltimore in 2023. Ya-Sin, who has not snagged an interception since 2020, is currently a free agent.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In some cases, that may be using a first-round pick on a player like Brock Bowers or Brian Thomas Jr. In others, it may be taking a player like Troy Franklin or Xavier Worthy on Day 2. Either way, it will be vital for Chris Ballard to surround Richardson with an explosive weapon in the passing game.\n\nMORE: 5 realistic targets for Colts in first round of NFL draft\n\nWe love to say that teams won't draft for need, but the Colts typically find a way to match value with need when it comes to their early picks. Whether it's using the No. 15 overall pick on a cornerback prospect like Terrion Arnold or Quinyon Mitchell, or waiting until Day 2 for options like Khyree Jackson, Max Melton or Cam Hart, the Colts need to add more starting competition to the cornerback room.\n\nIt wouldn't be a Chris Ballard draft without a trade or two. Depending on what the board looks like, there's a chance the Colts move back from No. 15 overall in the first round. That would likely net their biggest haul in a trade, and it might be difficult for Ballard to pass up. They also could try to move back from the No. 46 overall pick, which likely would net them a selection or two on Day 3. Either way, we should expect Ballard to add more draft capital to his seven current selections.\n\nMORE: 4 teams the Colts could trade down with in NFL draft\n\nThe Colts still have center Ryan Kelly for one more season, but they might be able to find his successor if Bortolini is available in the fourth round. An extremely smooth mover with experience all over the offensive line. He's still transitioning full-time to the center position, but his elite movement skills and intelligence give him extremely high upside with a year of development as a depth piece.\n\nConsidering the depth of this class, it's more likely the Colts wait until Day 3 to add to the safety position. They re-signed Julian Blackmon, which gives them a stop-gap for a season until he proves he can stay healthy. Adding a prospect like Malik Mustapha, Mark Perry or Ryan Watts on Day 3 would provide a solid mix of positional upside and special teams contributions.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ballard_(journalist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Ballard (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Franklin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Kelly_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Kelly (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/GettyImages-2040122706.jpg?itok=dgUduRuT", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

While they've made very few outside additions to their roster, GM Chris Ballard did prioritize re-signing many of his own players.\n\nLike every team, the Colts still have needs to be addressed in the draft and will have to strike that balance between finding some immediate help while also being mindful of long-term needs that could pop up in 2025 and beyond.\n\nHere are all of the things you need to know about the Colts entering the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nHow to watch\n\n(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)\n\nThe draft begins Thursday night and runs through Saturday. The three-day event from Detroit will be broadcast on ESPN, ABC and NFL Network:\n\n- Thursday (First round): 8:00 p.m. ET start\n\n- Friday (Second-third rounds): 7:00 p.m. ET start\n\n- Saturday (Fourth-seventh rounds): 12:00 p.m. ET start\n\nList of Colts picks\n\n(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)\n\nThe Colts will have seven selections in this year's draft-one in every round. Relativley speaking, this is on the lower side, with only four teams having fewer. In terms of draft capital value, the Colts rank 21st.\n\nDay 1 (one pick)\n\nFirst round, 15th overall\n\nDay 2 (two picks)\n\nSecond round, 46th overall\n\nThird round, 82nd overall\n\nDay 3 (four picks)\n\nFourth round, 117th overall\n\nFifth round, 151st overall\n\nSixth round, 191st overall\n\nSeventh round, 234th overall\n\nValue of the Colts draft picks\n\nIndianapolis Colts General Manager Chris Ballard speaks to the media Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024 at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center, the Colts Complex.\n\nThroughout Chris Ballard's tenure as GM, he has shown a willingess to move around the draft board via trades. More often than not, he's moved down, but there is some speculation at the moment that the Colts could look to trade up on the first day for a top cornerback.\n\nThe trade value chart was created by Jimmy Johnson in the 1990s when he was the head coach of Dallas. In short, the idea behind this is to ensure that trades invovling only draft picks are fair, by assigning each draft pick a value.\n\nOver time, new models have been developed, the purpose of it remains the same. Below is the value of each of the Colts' selections using the Rich Hill model and here is a link to the full chart.\n\nPick 15: 315\n\nPick 46: 128\n\nPick 82: 54\n\nPick 117: 25\n\nPick 151: 12\n\nPick 191: 6\n\nPick 234: 2\n\nColts biggest positions of need\n\nTrevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCornerback: Last season, the Colts went through the growing pains of relying on several rookies in the secondary. In short, this was an inconsistent group that gave up too many big plays and didn't make enough plays on the football. Ballard is optimistic that the experienced gained by these players along with getting Dallis Flowers back will lead to improved play in 2024, but relying heavily on that comes with obvious risks.\n\nSafety: In the short-term, the Colts could look to upgrade the free safety role next to Julian Blackmon. In the long-term, with Blackmon only back on a one-year deal, if the Colts don't add young talent in this year's draft, they'll find themselves in a similar predicament next offseason.\n\nWide receiver: The Colts have a very strong foundation at this position group with Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs, but are in need of more playmaking, whether that be with a vertical presence, added YAC ability, or ideally, both.\n\nEdge rusher: The Colts finished 2023 with the fifth-most sacks in football, but they ranked 23rd in pressures. If the Colts want to duplicate that sack production in 2024, from a sustainability perspective, they will have to get after the quarterback more consistently. On top of that, Dayo Odeyingbo and Kwity Paye - if the Colts don't pick up his fifth-year option for 2025 - are both free agents next offseason.\n\nFor a full breakdown of the Colts roster, click here.\n\n5 first round prospects to know\n\nMatthew Hinton-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCornerbacks Terrion Arnold and Quinyon Mitchell: These are the top two cornerbacks in this year's class and either would provide immediate help at the position. Arnold allowed a completion rate of just 52 percent last season, and Mitchell just 44 percent. Both players also had excellent ball production, something this Colts defense needs, and were willing run defenders.\n\nTight end Brock Bowers: I'm not sure if Bowers gets to the Colts, but if he does, he could provide that needed playmaking presence and do so in a unique way as a tight end. Bowers was a very reliable pass-catcher at Georgia and excellent with the ball in his hands.\n\nWide receiver Brian Thomas Jr.: I mentioned the Colts needing a vertical presence and Thomas would add that to the offense, averaging over 17 yards per catch last season. A consistent downfield target also opens up opportunities elsewhere for other pass-catchers.\n\nEdge rusher Jared Verse: Last season, Verse was one of the most disruptive pass rushers in college football and could be the Colts' highest rated edge rusher available when they are on the clock. Unlike previous year's this year's edge rusher class doesn't have the same overall depth.\n\nOfficial pre-draft visits\n\nTexas Longhorns wide receiver Xavier Worthy (1) celebrates a play in the fourth quarter of the Sugar Bowl College Football Playoff semi-finals at the Ceasars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, Jan. 1, 2024. The Huskies won the game 37-31.\n\nAs part of the pre-draft process, each NFL team can have 30 official visits where the player comes to the team facility. This is an opportunity for teams to address any red flags, do medical checks, and to get to know the player.

The Colts own seven total picks in the seven-round draft.\n\nAll rounds will be televised on ESPN/ABC and NFL Network and in Spanish on ESPN Deportes.\n\n* Head coach: Shane Steichen (second season with team)\n\n* General manager: Chris Ballard (eighth season with team)\n\n* Last year's record: 9-8\n\nThe Colts are coming off a promising first season under Steichen, who helped the team remain competitive despite a litany of key absences, including dual-threat rookie QB Anthony Richardson. The new face of the franchise missed one game due to a concussion and sustained a season-ending AC joint sprain in Week 5. Indianapolis weathered the storm and fell one win short of winning the AFC South behind backup QB Gardner Minshew, who is now with the Las Vegas Raiders. The expectations are high for Steichen and Richardson in Year 2 as they continue pushing Indianapolis into a new era.\n\nNote: Safety is a big need. However, the Colts don't seem likely to draft one on Day 1 or 2 and will probably aim to sign a veteran or two in free agency.\n\nCornerback: Kenny Moore II, whom the Colts retained in free agency, is the only proven cornerback on Indianapolis' roster. He fell just short of being named second-team All-Pro in 2023. JuJu Brents, a 2023 second-round pick, showed promise with one interception, six passes defensed and one forced fumble in his rookie season, but he only appeared in nine games due to various injuries.\n\nAssuming Brents starts alongside Moore in 2024, that leaves one more starting spot open on the outside, and the Colts don't have strong options. Ballard remains high on 2023 seventh-round pick Jaylon Jones and Dallis Flowers, who went undrafted in 2022 and is recovering from a torn Achilles he sustained in 2023, but they're far from safe bets. Indianapolis should seek to upgrade at cornerback early in the draft or the latter stages of free agency.\n\nWide receiver: Michael Pittman Jr., who recently inked a three-year, $70 million extension with $46 million guaranteed, headlines this group. There's still some debate about whether he's a No. 1 receiver, but that argument no longer matters because the Colts believe he's their No. 1 receiver given the contract he just signed. Slot receiver Josh Downs, who had an impressive rookie season in 2023, and deep threat Alec Pierce round out the rest of Indianapolis' wide receiver room.\n\nThe team could still use another explosive playmaker at that position. LSU star Brian Thomas Jr., who tallied an FBS-high 17 receiving TDs last year, is the first wideout that comes to mind who could be in Indianapolis' range with the No. 15 pick. Obviously, there will be other options early in the draft, but the bottom line is Indianapolis should prioritize making Richardson's job as easy as possible by adding another premier target.\n\nEdge rusher: The Colts set the Indianapolis-era franchise record with 51 sacks last season. Defensive end Samson Ebukam, who joined the Colts last year via free agency, led the way with 9.5 sacks. Fellow defensive end Kwity Paye finished second with 8.5 sacks, but it's not exactly a no-brainer for Indianapolis to pick up the 2021 first-round pick's fifth-year option. The Colts have until May 2 to decide if they're willing to pay Paye $13.4 million in 2025. Ballard thinks Paye and 2021 draftmate Dayo Odeyingbo, who tallied eight sacks in 2023, took significant steps forward last year, though it's fair to wonder if they'll ever become elite pass rushers at this stage of their careers.\n\nIndianapolis had an NFL-low 15.7 blitz percentage in defensive coordinator Gus Bradley's second season with the team, and its 19.6 QB pressure percentage ranked 22nd in the NFL, per Pro Football Reference. It would be na\u00efve to expect Bradley to change his system, so the most realistic way to potentially improve the Colts' pass rush would be for Ballard to take another swing at selecting an difference-making edge rusher in the draft.\n\nDraft mailbag: Would GM Chris Ballard trade a haul for Marvin Harrison Jr.?\n\nNFL mock draft analysis: What Dane Brugler got right and where he might have gone wrong\n\nColts and 'The Beast': Dream picks, sleepers and fun facts about Indy's top targets\n\nColts 2024 NFL Draft big board: 15 targets to watch at WR, CB and more\n\nGM Chris Ballard likes Colts' young CBs, but are they good enough for him to bet on?\n\nColts 10-step offseason plan: Franchise tag Michael Pittman Jr., draft Brock Bowers\n\nExploring Colts' options at TE: Bank on Jelani Woods' development?

Other teams are just going to let Brock Bowers fall? He's not getting past the Colts.\n\n2023: QB Anthony Richardson, No. 4 -- Limited to four games as a rookie, Richardson completed 59.5 percent of his passes for three TDs against one pick. He also tallied 25 carries for 136 yards and four touchdowns against one lost fumble. Richardson, who turns 22 in May, became the youngest player in NFL history with multiple passing TDs and a rushing TD in one game with his three-touchdown performance in an overtime loss against the Rams in Week 4. Despite the defeat, Ballard and Steichen both said the game validated Richardson's star potential. The dynamic QB will now be tasked with trying to end Indianapolis' three-year playoff drought in 2024.\n\n2022: WR Alec Pierce, No. 53 -- Pierce took a step back from his rookie season and finished with 32 catches for 514 yards and two TDs in 2023. The receiver's regression was due, in large part, to the Colts' inability to push the ball downfield when Minshew replaced Richardson at QB. One could argue Downs, who corralled a rookie franchise record 68 catches for 771 yards and two TDs, has emerged as the Colts' clear No. 2 wideout. However, Ballard still thinks Pierce is a more dynamic than what he's shown, and he should have the chance to display more of his abilities with a healthy Richardson in 2024.\n\n2021: DE Kwity Paye, No. 21 -- Paye produced his best and healthiest season as a pro in 2023. He totaled a career-high 8.5 sacks in 16 games, which was up from six sacks in 12 games in 2022 and four sacks in 15 games in 2021. The irony in Paye increasing his sacks last year is that he didn't put a lot of pressure on the QB otherwise. He had just six QB hurries, and his nine QB hits were a career low. Paye has proven he is a good player, but the question now is whether or not he can become a game-changer.\n\n2020: WR Michael Pittman Jr., No. 34 -- Pittman put together a career year in 2023, totaling 109 catches for 1,152 yards and four TDs. He became the fourth player in Colts history to record at least 100 catches and 1,000 receiving yards in a single season, joining Indianapolis wide receivers coach Reggie Wayne, Pro Football Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison Sr. and former tight end Dallas Clark.\n\nPittman took over as the Colts' No. 1 receiver after his rookie season, and he's totaled 296 receptions for 3,159 yards and 14 TDs over the last three years. The 26-year-old only missed two games during that span, and his availability and production are why Indianapolis had no choice but to sign him to a lucrative contract extension this offseason. The only wide receivers who've tallied more catches and targets (426) throughout the last three seasons are Las Vegas' Davante Adams, Miami's Tyreek Hill, Buffalo's Stefon Diggs, Minnesota's Justin Jefferson, Dallas' CeeDee Lamb and Detroit's Amon-Ra St. Brown, all of whom have been named first-team All-Pros.\n\n2019: CB Rock Ya-Sin, No. 34 -- Ya-Sin is one of Ballard's biggest draft misses. He started 13 games as a rookie and recorded one interception and five passes defensed, but he never became a full-time starter. After pedestrian campaigns in 2020 and 2021, Indianapolis traded Ya-Sin to the Raiders before the 2022 season in exchange for defensive end Yannick Ngakoue. Ya-Sin was serviceable in Las Vegas, starting nine of the 11 games he played that year, before signing a one-year, $4 million deal with Baltimore in 2023. Ya-Sin, who has not snagged an interception since 2020, is currently a free agent.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Some of them may come from trades we didn't expect or from the team selecting a player we didn't believe they had interest in.\n\nWhen going through some bold predictions, it's best to understand that it's unlikely that most -- or all -- of these come true. That's why they are bold. But we also want to provide some avenues of realistic possibilities within them.\n\nSN's NFL DRAFT HQ\n\nLive picks tracker | 7-round mock draft | Top 250 big board\n\nThere has been a lot of recent chatter about the potential for the Colts trading up in the first round of the draft. It's something general manager Chris Ballard has never done during his tenure, and the chances are it will continue that way. In fact, it's more likely the Colts move back in the first round.\n\nMORE: Trade down partners for the Colts in NFL draft\n\nBut we're getting bold here. Moving up for an offensive weapon is still a plausible notion even if it's unlikely. If tight end Brock Bowers or one of the Big 3 wide receivers falls to the double digits, there's a scenario Ballard pulls the trigger. Again, it's unlikely, but not completely implausible.\n\nThe fourth round is kind of an arbitrary number here, but the class is deep enough to where the Colts could get a starter in the first three rounds. Most of the mock drafts have the Colts taking a cornerback in the first round and it's rare to find predictions in which Indy bypasses the position altogether through the first two days.\n\nHowever, there may be some truth to what Ballard said in terms of his faith in the current cornerback room. They saw promising returns from rookie JuJu Brents and Jaylon Jones, and Dallis Flowers is expected to return from a torn Achilles. Is it recommended that the Colts wait until Day 3 to draft its first cornerback? Absolutely not. But crazier things have happened.\n\nThis would not be a fun situation for Colts fans considering the current state of the depth chart. Even though things got a little better after re-signing Julian Blackmon to a one-year deal, the depth and future of the position bring a lot of question marks.\n\nMORE: How the Colts can get an A-plus draft haul\n\nWith that said, it wouldn't be a surprise if Ballard felt comfortable enough to bypass the position entirely with second-year Daniel Scott also coming off an ACL tear. The class isn't expected to be a deep crop even if there are some solid Day 3 fits that may intrigue the Colts, and there's a scenario in which Ballard takes his chances going into 2024.\n\nThe Colts haven't made a trade yet this offseason, but we should expect a few throughout draft weekend. It's rare that Ballard makes a trade that involves a player, but it has happened a few times throughout his tenure. The prime candidate to be moved off the roster is the team's current starting tight end.\n\nMORE: 1 tight end prospect for Colts in each round of NFL draft\n\nWhile they're in solid standing with the salary cap, trading Alie-Cox would free up $5.9 million in space. This might especially be true if the Colts wind up taking Brock Bowers in the first round. Again, it probably won't happen, and the Colts wouldn't get much for Alie-Cox, but he's the player with the highest chance of being traded during the draft.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylon_Jones_(American_football,_born_2002)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylon Jones (American football, born 2002)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Scott_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Scott (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2021-08/mo-alie-cox-091920-getty-ftr_1vbg9b76ss7mh13ywqi4x8boqe.jpg?itok=n0TyacTG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Let's take a look.\n\nThe dream selection for Colts fans this draft season has been tight end Brock Bowers. The two-time Mackey Award winner has long been projected as a top-tier talent in this class, but the recent run of tight ends flaming out in the first round, combined with how stacked the top of this class is, could lead to Bowers falling right into the Colts' lap.\n\nBowers is a special pass catcher that won in multiple ways at the college level. He was used as a downfield threat early in his career before settling into more of an underneath/schemed touches option in 2023. He forced 18 missed tackles after the catch last season, showcasing his dynamic ability after the catch. Colts head coach Shane Steichen has always had a dominant tight end target in his offense, and Bowers would be the perfect fit in his RPO-heavy system.\n\nThe two threats in front of the Colts to take Bowers before their pick are the New York Jets and the Denver Broncos. Both teams are in desperate need of offensive line help, however, which could lead to this elite talent falling to the Colts at 15. If that does happen, the Colts can sprint their pick in the second they are on the clock.\n\nThe Colts' second-round selection could be a difficult one this year. Aside from a few players slipping like Edgerrin Cooper (Texas A&M linebacker) or Max Melton (Rutgers cornerback), the team could be stuck with a cluster of options they are more fine with at this spot rather than elated with. In typical Chris Ballard fashion, I decided to move back from the Colts' spot at 46 to 51 while picking up an additional fourth-round selection from the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOne of the Colts' biggest needs in this draft is safety. Julian Blackmon is likely to slide in at strong safety this upcoming season, but the team could use another body at free. I went with Washington State's Jaden Hicks at this spot mainly due to his size, his upside, and his age. At just 21 years old, Hicks is a versatile player that has cornerback experience and is one of the best tacklers in the draft class.\n\nHicks would immediately give the Colts another weapon in their secondary, and his ability to play in the box and over the top would lead to more diverse looks from the Colts' pre-snap. A trio of Hicks, Blackmon, and Nick Cross would have sky-high potential for the Colts in 2024.\n\nThe Colts' offensive line is set for this upcoming season, but there is a need to restock with younger players in preparation for free agency in 2025. Starting offensive linemen Will Fries and Ryan Kelly are set to hit the open market next year, and it's likely that the Colts will let one of them walk in order to look at cheaper options on the roster. Wisconsin's Tanor Bortolini would be the perfect player to sit and develop for a year to take over in 2025.\n\nBortolini is a younger prospect that has experience starting at both guard and center in his career. He is one of the better pass protectors in the class and he has the athleticism to reach any block asked of him on the exterior. He has the upside to be a legit starter in the NFL, and he should pair perfectly with OL Coach Tony Sparano Jr.\n\nBortolini may be a slight reach here in round three, but this pick should pay off in a big way come 2025 if/when Kelly walks for a new team.\n\nThe Colts finally address their need at wide receiver in this mock draft, going with Washington's Jalen McMillan in round four. This may be a bit of a slide for McMillan, but in a draft loaded with talent at the position, he could be available by the time the Colts pick in round four. McMillan hit 1,000 yards receiving back in 2022 and still managed to hit the 500-yard mark last season despite dealing with injuries.\n\nMcMillan is a talented vertical threat who has some experience working in the screen game as well. He would be a strong complement to what the Colts already have at the position while adding depth at a position of need for the team. With some time and development, McMillan could one day be a starter in the league.\n\nBallard's favorite player in this draft class is bound to be Houston Christian's Jalyx Hunt. A former safety, Hunt eventually moved into more of a pass rusher role in his final collegiate season. He excelled at this new position, totaling 9.0 sacks as the star playmaker for his defense. The Colts could take Hunt on day three of the draft with the intention of playing him in a variety of roles at the next level.\n\nHunt's size and arm length would be well-suited for a hybrid linebacker/edge role with the Colts, and he has the special teams upside to be an impact player from day one (he blocked a kick last season). The Colts use the extra fourth rounder they gained in a trade back to grab one of the more interesting project players in the draft.\n\nWhat happens next for the Colts? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our free newsletter and get breaking Colts news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nBallard has averaged nine draft picks a year since the 2020 draft, so I performed another trade back here to get the Colts to that number. The Colts sent their original fifth-round selection while picking up the Philadelphia Eagles' selections at 172 and 210. With this pick in the fifth round, I went with Pittsburgh cornerback M.J. Devonshire.\n\nThe Colts waited a while on cornerback in this mock draft, but Devonshire would give them another battle-tested player with great upside late in the draft. He was left on an island at Pitt, and his ability to survive out there could be valuable to a team like the Colts. His physical style of play and athletic upside are absolutely worth a flier on day three of the draft.\n\nThe Colts lost a rugged, tough running backup in Zack Moss this offseason, so a natural option to replace him late in the draft is Troy's Kimani Vidal. Vidal is a bowling ball of a running back with a powerful lower half and fantastic explosion. He may not have that elite home run speed, but he is more than capable of handling a few rotational carries a game as a reserve.\n\nVidal has a lot of tread on his tires and is one of the more experienced runners in the draft. His ability on zone run concepts is also a plus, as he almost exclusively ran out of the gun last season. Schematically and athletically, Vidal is what the Colts need at RB2 in this draft.\n\nDay three of the draft is the perfect time to swing on traits, and the Colts could use another offensive tackle in the room. Tylan Grable is a former high school quarterback that eventually moved down to the offensive tackle position. He has been a stellar player at the college level ever since, and he is the exact type of player to take a shot on in the draft.\n\nSince the Colts added an additional sixth-round pick with a trade back in this mock, I had the luxury of swinging for the fences with Grable on day three.\n\nThe final pick in this mock draft goes to cornerback yet again, this time with small-school prospect Willie Drew. A former James Madison recruit, Drew had to work his way back from a major knee injury early in his career to earn playing time at D-II Virginia State. He eventually regained his former form, becoming one of the best cornerbacks in all of D-II last season.\n\nDrew is a physical, long-armed cornerback who impressed at the Senior Bowl this offseason. He has the traits and the mindset to be a great pick here in the seventh round.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The first round of the 2024 NFL Draft kicks off tonight at 8:00 p.m. ET in Detroit, concluding months of anticipation.\n\nFor Indianapolis Colts fans, this year's selection process is a true mystery. Last year, everyone knew that a quarterback would be the pick in the first round, which ultimately became Anthony Richardson. This year, who knows? The positions that the Colts need most are rich in talent in the first round, so anything could happen.\n\nWith that in mind, the staff at Horseshoe Huddle each took a shot at predicting what will happen for the Colts:\n\nThe cornerback room on this team isn't deep enough to not take one in the first round. If GM Chris Ballard doesn't want to sign a corner in free agency, then drafting Quinyon Mitchell is the next best (and possibly cheapest) option. Mitchell scored a 9.75 out of 10 on the RAS test during the Combine, placing himself in the top 3% of all corners since 1987. Not only is he an incredible athlete, the corner won back-to-back MAC championships while earning places on multiple All-American teams. Ballard could have a no-brainer if the team opts to improve their defense. -- Sean Ackerman\n\nThe Colts could have a golden opportunity at No. 15 if Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell is still on the board. He's close to being the consensus top cornerback in the draft class. The Colts could simply run their card up for Mitchell, which would add more youth to the team's developing secondary. Or, trading back to gain more draft capital is another option because other teams could overpay for the right to draft Mitchell. Both choices are appealing. The potential offers could sway Indianapolis in one direction. How far the Colts will have to fall back in a trade will likely be another factor. -- Dave Holcomb\n\nI think the Colts would feel entirely comfortable picking up an extra pick or two in a trade-down, but in my mind, it comes down to two players who have a chance to be available and could convince them to reject any pending trade offers, stay at 15, and make a selection. I think these two players are Dallas Turner and Brock Bowers. Both players are ranked in the top 10 of consensus big boards, but the number of quarterbacks, offensive linemen, and wide receivers projected to be taken before the Colts' selection could see at least one of them slide out of the top 10 and be there for the taking at 15. With Bowers playing a non-premium position and his lack of athletic testing in the pre-draft process, I believe he is the one more likely to fall into the Colts' lap. -- Noah Gebert\n\nThe smart money prediction for the Colts tonight would be on a trade-back, but I'm going to be bold and predict the team to stay put. This draft class is stacked with talent at the top, and it only takes 1-2 reaches for a blue-chip player to fall into the Colts' lap. I predict the team has a legit talent like Brock Bowers or Dallas Turner slip to them, forcing them to stay put and take their guy. -- Zach Hicks\n\nWhat happens next for the Colts? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our free newsletter and get breaking Colts news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nWhile I think the Colts will be enticed to move up if one of the top three receivers falls to the 8-10 range, ultimately, they stick and pick at 15. The pick is Brian Thomas Jr., the big deep threat out of LSU. While early on, I think his role will be similar to what Alec Pierce does, Thomas has the potential to be so much more. With some development, Thomas may eventually develop into a true number-one in the NFL. A more explosive Tee Higgins is certainly in his realm of outcomes. -- Shaad McGinnis\n\nI've been pretty tortured over this one due to the likelihood that someone like Brock Bowers or Dallas Turner falls to 15, but ultimately I think the Colts value their draft picks (their lack of outside activity in free agency indicates reliance on the draft). With that being the case, the Colts should have a group of players they like at 15, so they trade back just far enough here (Pittsburgh Steelers at 20) so they can still take someone from the group while also getting a couple of extra picks. Brian Thomas Jr. is the perfect weapon for the Colts, essentially giving them a more explosive version of what they wanted in Alec Pierce with the addition of YAC ability. Thomas pulling defenses vertically, which opens up space underneath for Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs, is a deadly tool for Shane Steichen to have. -- Jake Arthur\n\nThe dream for the Colts would be for Brock Bowers to fall to 15, where Indy would run up the card to add him to Shane Steichen's offense as a weapon for Anthony Richardson. While the dream is not dead, the more realistic option is the Colts trading back to the early 20s and grabbing a wide receiver. Ultimately, I see the Philadelphia Eagles trading up with the Colts to grab a cornerback and Indy selecting Xavier Worthy, the speedster out of Texas, at No.22. Worthy gives the Colts a burner that would take the vertical passing game to a completely new level. -- Andrew Moore\n\nThe Colts need receiver and cornerback badly. Luckily, they can trade back and still land one, while getting the other in Round 2. I believe the Colts trade back with the Arizona Cardinals (27) or Buffalo Bills (28) and select Xavier Worthy. This gives Indy an explosive receiver while grabbing more early-round selections. -- Drake Wally", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_arthur@si.com", "name": "Jake Arthur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Turner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Richardson_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Richardson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football All-America Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-American_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mid-American Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Pierce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pittman_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Pittman Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Steichen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Steichen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3600,h_2025,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hwaxvbcafgvr6422je", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

I wouldn't be able to do my job without your interest in and support for our work at The Athletic. This is an exciting time of the year with the NFL Draft just two days away, so without further ado, let's dig in.\n\nNote: Questions have been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhat are the chances the Colts trade up for Marvin Harrison Jr.? -- Steve D.\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard recently told Rich Eisen he'd have to live in \"fantasy land\" to trade up for Harrison, which all but shut the door on that possibility. I understand what it would mean to Indy to bring in the son of a Colts legend, but it doesn't seem realistic. The Colts would have to relinquish a boatload of draft capital to land a top-five pick, which goes against Ballard's track record of collecting picks. Harrison is a star, and in this scenario, he's too bright of a star for Indy to acquire. I blame the elder Harrison for making his son just a little too good.\n\nHow would the draft board have to shake out on draft night to warrant a major trade up? -- Zachary S.\n\nThe most realistic scenario comes if Harrison, LSU's Malik Nabers and Georgia's Brock Bowers are all off the board and Washington's Rome Odunze is still available at No. 9. Assuming the Colts are sold on him and willing to trade up with the Chicago Bears, Indy would obviously have to part ways with the No. 15 pick and probably its second-round pick to acquire a receiver as special as Odunze. He has exceptional athleticism, evidenced by his 9.92 RAS (relative athletic score) and the big-play ability that could take Richardson and Indianapolis' offense to another level. The team would essentially have two No. 1-caliber receivers in Odunze and Michael Pittman Jr.\n\nWhat do you make of Peter Schrager's recent mock draft? Is this the year Ballard gets aggressive to score a premium offensive weapon? -- David T.\n\nSchrager's mock draft, which features the Colts trading up to No. 9 to acquire Nabers, is realistic but still unlikely. The draft board would have to fall just right, and the Colts would have to be completely convinced Nabers is a future superstar. But remember, Ballard has never traded up in the first round during the first seven years of his tenure, so it's hard for me to see him doing that now. Ballard said this year's draft class is deep at wide receiver, so he prefers picking whoever is available if the Colts stay put. For what it's worth, LSU's Brian Thomas Jr. wouldn't be a bad consolation prize.\n\nThe consensus top needs for the Colts seem to be a wide receiver, a cornerback and a pass rusher. Which player at another position would entice Ballard to bypass those three needs on the first two days of the draft? -- Nicolas L.\n\nBowers is the answer here. He has drawn comparisons to San Francisco 49ers All-Pro George Kittle and former Colts All-Pro Dallas Clark, so if that's the caliber player the Colts believe they would be getting, it's hard to pass up on him. Bowers is ranked No. 7 overall on The Athletic's consensus big board.\n\nMy sleeper pick is safety because Indianapolis still doesn't have a clear idea of who will be its starting free safety. Perhaps a player like Washington State's Jaden Hicks or Utah's Cole Bishop would be selected early to compete for that role.\n\nDoes the lack of testing and measurements on Bowers make teams hesitate a little about spending a top-15 pick on him? -- Ryhn S.\n\nNot at all. He's a special player, so as long as his medicals check out, he won't have to wait long to hear his name called when the draft begins.\n\nDo you think Ballard feels pressure to draft a top receiver/tight end to keep up with the talent levels of the teams in the AFC South? -- Reilly C.\n\nBallard should feel pressure because he's going into his eighth season without having won a division title. Of course he's aware of other division rivals' offseason additions, most notably the Houston Texans', but that likely won't force him to act out of character. Ballard has always been a relatively conservative GM, and after bringing back almost the same roster from last year, he's probably content with the structure of his team. It would be naive to expect Ballard to suddenly have a change of heart and aggressively trade up in the first round. The bottom line is, whether Ballard acknowledges it or not, the Colts need a healthy Richardson to elevate the team.\n\nI've been Team Ballard this whole time, but I'm losing faith. What do you think the win-loss thresholds are for him to guarantee keeping or losing his job? -- Robert C.\n\nMissing the playoffs would certainly be a huge disappointment, but I don't believe Ballard's job security will come down to wins and losses (unless Indianapolis falls way below .500). Maybe that's not the answer some people want to hear, but it's reality. Ballard will be here as long as owner Jim Irsay says so, and Irsay has given no indication Ballard is even remotely on the hot seat.\n\nBallard loves to draft (offensive) linemen. Where are the potential holes on the line that he might try to address on the second night? -- Caleb O.\n\nI'm not sure Ballard will spend a Day 2 pick on a lineman. That's more of a Day 3 assignment. But if he plans to bolster the offensive line, he'd probably look at center, right guard and right tackle. Starting center Ryan Kelly, 30, and right guard Will Fries, 26, are entering the final year of their contracts. Meanwhile, starting right tackle Braden Smith, 28, is returning from knee surgery after an injury-riddled 2023 campaign. All three players still have good football left in them, but things can change fast in the NFL, and Ballard must always think ahead.\n\nWhat is the one position you can see the Colts drafting in rounds 1 and 2 that will make fans say, \"WHAT?!\" -- Aaron B.\n\nIf the Colts draft a quarterback, I'm fairly certain thousands of fans would show up at the team practice facility with pitchforks. Aside from that, a running back or defensive tackle on the first two days would be pretty inexcusable.\n\nCornerback seems to be a serious need. Ballard has never used a first-round pick on a CB (though he has used seconds in the past). Is he philosophically opposed to using a No. 1 on the position? -- Chris P.\n\nI don't think Ballard is opposed. In years past, an argument can be made the Colts didn't need to draft a cornerback in the first round. However, that argument becomes harder to make this year if Indy passes on a first-round CB like Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell or Alabama's Terrion Arnold in favor of a pass catcher or edge rusher. I still believe Indy should draft a CB in the first round because it's the team's most pressing need, but I'm not sure Ballard sees it the same way after his bullish comments on JuJu Brents, Jaylon Jones and Dallis Flowers.\n\nDo you ever get a sense of how Colts players feel about how Ballard handles free-agency transactions? Obviously, he's loyal to his players, but any indication from the Colts roster on Ballard rarely signing an outside free agent? -- J.T. F.\n\nIn fairness, Ballard did sign free agents. He just signed his own. To that point, the in-house players are probably glad Ballard didn't sign any outside free agents because whenever a new player comes in, it means someone likely isn't going to get a payday and/or will see their role diminished.\n\nThere are only so many spots on an NFL roster, so if I'm a player on the team, I'd probably always appreciate a GM who believes in me and my teammates versus a GM who is constantly overhauling the roster with outside additions.\n\nWhich scenario is more likely: The Colts trade up into the top 10 to get one of the top three WRs/Bowers, or the Colts take a CB at No. 15 and trade up for a receiver who falls into the late 20s/30s (Brian Thomas Jr., Adonai Mitchell, etc.)? -- Rahoul H.\n\nI'd argue both are unlikely, but the first scenario is the most unlikely. Again, Ballard has never traded up in the first round, so I wouldn't expect that to change. If I squint, I can see the second scenario unfolding if Indy becomes enamored of a pass catcher. However, Ballard remains confident in the young cornerbacks already on the roster, so unless he was blowing smoke, he might pass on a cornerback in the first round altogether.\n\nIs there a late-round prospect Colts fans should keep their eyes on? Or maybe a position we wouldn't expect to be picked? -- Jaxon S.\n\nLook for a running back on Day 3. We've all kind of overlooked the significance of Zack Moss' departure because of other, more pressing needs, but the Colts would be wise to invest in a potential backup for Jonathan Taylor, who has missed a combined 13 games due to injury over the past two years. Two running backs I like: Purdue's Tyrone Tracy Jr. (9.78 RAS) and Louisville's Isaac Guerendo (9.90 RAS). Both are projected as fourth- or fifth-round picks by The Athletic's draft guru, Dane Brugler.\n\nGiven the Colts' interest in Danielle Hunter, and their good-but-not-great edge rushers, do you think Kwity Paye/Dayo Odeyingbo could be a trade option for a more established edge rush or corner? -- Dylan V.\n\nNo, Ballard remains high on Paye and Odeyingbo as they each head into their fourth seasons. I also don't think they'd fetch a whole lot on the trade market.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_boyd@theathletic.com",

Weird, unpredictable stuff will happen in the draft - someone who's a \"lock\" to go to one team will wind up getting drafted before or after that team goes on the clock.\n\nAnd anything you may have seen in the past few weeks about a team liking a guy or not - chances are it's inaccurate, a guess, or an inaccurate guess.\n\n\"Just look at the mock drafts and tell me how accurate they are after the draft,\" Colts general manager Chris Ballard said a year ago. \"Nobody knows. Nobody is giving out information.\"\n\nWhatever information comes from teams is probably subterfuge. And teams have access to much, much more information than the public possesses. Keep that in mind as we turn our attention to the stage in Detroit and actually find out who these teams are going to pick.\n\nBut let's go back to this time last year, when the Colts held the No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft and had two other top-80 selections. We here at Colts.com aggregated 136 mock drafts, and actually, mock draft'ers did a pretty good job: 71 of those 136 had the Colts selecting quarterback Anthony Richardson in the first round, by far the highest total of any player.\n\nAnd the most mocked player to the Colts with second or third round picks was wide receiver Josh Downs, who five prescient experts predicted would wind up in Indianapolis. The Colts selected North Carolina receiver in the third round, and he broke Bill Brooks' long-standing franchise rookie receptions record in 2023.\n\nBut last year was maybe a little easier - the Colts were in the market for a quarterback, and there were only a handful of quarterbacks who anyone figured would be available with the No. 4 overall pick.\n\nThe last time the Colts had a later first round pick was 2021, when they used the No. 21 overall selection on defensive end Kwity Paye. Twenty different players were mocked to the Colts that year by the ones we collected, and Paye was behind two players in total mocks - one of whom wasn't even drafted in the first round.\n\nSo consider this your annual disclaimer: Nobody knows what the Colts will do on Thursday and Friday night, and then Saturday afternoon in Detroit. The Colts don't even know - it depends on how things play out ahead of them. Realistically, only one or two teams know what they're going to do in a given draft. The rest are reading their board and reacting to what happens ahead of them.\n\nBut with that in mind, the mock drafts we've been collecting over the last few weeks should serve as a guide for who the Colts could take, not who they will take. Consider these the names you should know heading into Thursday and Friday - even though they could be off the board by the time the Colts pick, or could be guys the Colts pass on who are taken later in the first round, or even could be guys who slide into the second round.\n\nThe draft is unpredictable, and that's what makes it such an intriguing, drama-filled, made-for-TV event.\n\nBefore we get into the final numbers, though, let's add a few mock drafts that came in after our last Monday update:", "source": {"uri": "colts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "colts.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jj_stankevitz@colts.com", "name": "Jj Stankevitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mock draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Richardson_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Richardson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Brooks_(wide_receiver)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Brooks (wide receiver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwity_Paye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kwity Paye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/ihxjlx2bgworlrukhlnx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

While nobody knows exactly what direction general manager Chris Ballard wants to take, it's fair to say his selection will fall under the same category as years past: freak athletes.\n\nBallard loves raw athletes and the numbers back it up. A majority of his draft picks achieve a high Relative Athletic Score (RAS) in pre-draft workouts, living by the idea that skill can be taught - but not athleticism. Ballard has cemented himself as someone who will side with potential rather than proven ability.\n\nIn Pro Football Focus' newest seven-round mock draft, the Colts elected to move down to the bottom of the first round and select linebacker Payton Wilson out of N.C. State at pick number 29. In the mock trade with the Detroit Lions, Indy receives picks 29, 61, and a 2025 third. In return, Detroit receives picks 15 and 117, and drafts cornerback Quinyon Mitchell at 15.\n\nWhat happens next for the Colts? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our free newsletter and get breaking Colts news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nThere's not necessarily a need at linebacker, but drafting Wilson would follow suit with years past for Ballard. Wilson scored a 9.81 out of 10 on the RAS scale, demonstrating pure athleticism at a position where the Colts have lots of young talent. After last year's fiasco with linebacker Shaquille Leonard, Indy could take another electric linebacker with playmaking ability.\n\nThe issue with the pick is that it doesn't address either of the Colts' biggest needs: cornerback and wide receiver. The 2023 secondary was plagued with injuries and got picked apart week after week, but there's plenty of prospects who could start from day one in 2024 at pick 15.\n\nWith loads of talk about the Colts moving up to draft weapons, it's always best to expect the unexpected from Ballard. Last year, reporters had conflicted reports about the Colts' pick but nothing was assured until draft time. In an AFC South division that's improving by the day, the draft will be ultra-important for a team not known for signing free agents.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_ackerman@si.com", "name": "Sean Ackerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ballard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Ballard (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_Leonard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3912,h_2200,x_0,y_116/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw5vx6zg76fda63typ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Latest seven-round mock draft for Indianapolis", "body": "The NFL Draft is this week. It offers another chance for Chris Ballard and the Indianapolis Colts to build the way they always do, which is by drafting and developing. They have a few needs to address, but this is also the way they acquire building block players for the long haul.\n\nIt's a different draft than last year, when everyone knew they were going with a quarterback. They have a few different routes they could take, but here's one hypothetical done through the NFL Mock Draft Database's simulator.\n\nFor this exercise, I chose not to make any trades, though we know Ballard will end up making some as he always does. I mostly chose from the players available but did pass on a couple of players I can't see actually being available at that slot.\n\nThe Colts have seven picks in this year's draft, one per round, starting with No. 15 overall. They have a major hole in the secondary, primarily at outside cornerback, but also have a need for another pass catcher for Richardson. They can always use more pass rush help, too.\n\nThe Colts need a pass catcher for Richardson who goes beyond Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs. Ideally, that comes at tight end, where Jelani Woods has durability questions and the Colts don't have any other established options.\n\nBrock Bowers is the perfect pick if the Colts were to stay at No. 15 and he becomes available. He's the only first-round caliber tight end in the draft, one of the best yards-after-catch prospects in years and a man who led Georgia in receiving in three straight seasons en route to two national championships. He'll be a perfect fit for Shane Steichen's screen- and run-pass-option-heavy playbook and should be able to hit the ground running as their No. 1 tight end.\n\nMORE: How the Colts can ace the 2024 NFL Draft: Trading up for Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nThe Colts could use, at minimum, a No. 4 wide receiver and ideally someone who can push Alec Pierce as a starting 'Z' receiver. They get that and more in Xavier Worthy, who is projected to sneak into the first round.\n\nIt means double-dipping on pass catchers, but this spring is all about developing Richardson, so the Colts won't mind. Steichen can always find use for more talented offensive weapons. This one happens to have gone for 1,000 yards in the Big 12 Conference last season and is an electric return man with his blistering 4.21-second 40-yard dash time. That's something else Indianapolis needs to address in this draft.\n\nThe Colts clearly want to build their pass defense primarily through the pass rush. They have potential future needs forming on the edge with Dayo Odeyingbo and Kwity Paye entering contract years. It makes for a fit with Adisa Isaac, a player who made a strong impression at the Senior Bowl after breaking out with 16 tackles-for-loss and 7.5 sacks in the Big Ten last season.\n\nHe'll start as a situational pass rusher, someone to step in to give a little more juice than Paye can on third downs. It means keeping the secondary a major need, but that's how the draft is falling, and that's also a position that has free agents to sign after the draft.\n\nThe Colts finally add to their secondary with a player built ideally for their press-man, zone-heavy scheme. Cam Hart measures 6-foot-3 and 202 pounds, making him a strong complement to JuJu Brents and Jaylon Jones in this young room. He handled covering Marvin Harrison Jr. about as well as any cornerback last season, showing off traits that can be developed.\n\nHe'll need seasoning, much like Jones did, but he gives the Colts a third cornerback who can split reps at a position that's becoming hodgepodge in nature.\n\nThe Colts double-dip on Fighting Irish prospects with Audric Estime, who falls to the fifth round. Estime was a workhorse the past two seasons, totaling 2,261 yards and 29 rushing touchdowns. He doesn't have the top-end speed of some other backs but runs with power and can catch out of the backfield, making him an ideal Zack Moss replacement as the top backup and goal-line option to Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe Colts are into their depth picks now. Edefuan Ulofoshio is a sixth-year player without elite measurables but was a big-time leader on a defense that played for the national championship last season, when he racked up 94 tackles and eight tackles-for-loss. He brings a lot of the characteristics that Zaire Franklin once did and can be the next linebacker the Colts start on special teams and try to develop from there.\n\nThe all-big-school draft is complete with a quarterback who mirrors Richardson in some interesting ways. Joe Milton stands a giant 6-5 and 235 pounds. Last year at Tennessee, he threw for 20 touchdowns and ran for seven more. That was his sixth year in college, and the lack of development has led to questions about how he can fit at the next level. But as a seventh-round swing, he can slide in as the Colts' No. 3 quarterback behind two similarly framed passers in Richardson and Joe Flacco, which also makes a great room to learn from.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelani_Woods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jelani Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pittman_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Pittman Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Pierce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alec Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayo_Odeyingbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dayo Odeyingbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwity_Paye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kwity Paye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audric_Estime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audric Estime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zack Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaire_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaire Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/60hKQOdymnoJtSbFHy7diA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/indystar-the-indianapolis-star/064728ce349f2a564b2c244de4c381b8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

General manager Chris Ballard has been effective in the draft during his eight seasons with the Colts, but here's a look at how it could all go wrong starting Thursday night.\n\nColts worst-case 2024 NFL Draft scenario\n\nThe Colts enter the draft with two obvious needs -- receiver and cornerback - but after focusing on re-signing their own free agents, they might take some chances in pursuit of increasing the team's ceiling while trying to compensate for the lack of outside free agents.\n\nRound 1, Pick 15: Quinyon Mitchell, cornerback, Toledo\n\nDespite tight end Brock Bowers still being on the board, Colts go with athletic cornerback Quinyon Mitchell to provide depth for a young group of cornerbacks after not adding on the outside in free agency. Mitchell scored a 9.75 RAS score - and Ballard loves his athletic prospects - so you can't question the need or promise, but what will the adjustment period be for Toledo player? Passing on a highly rated receiver to support second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson is a mistake.\n\nRound 2, Pick 46: Adisa Isaac, edge rusher, Penn State\n\nThe Colts set an Indianapolis record with 51 sacks last season, but teams were using max protection schemes at the end of the year and taking advantage of the inexperienced secondary. Adisa Isaac is the top-rated pass rusher left on the board but turns out to be more of the same: Good player but not the explosive playmaker the team needs to compensate for its secondary.\n\nMore about the draft: When the Colts pick in NFL Draft 2024\n\nRound 3, Pick 82: Jalen McMillan, wide receiver, Washington\n\nHaving to chase the areas not addressed in free agency, the Colts don't get Richardson any help until the third round. Jalen McMillan is fast and versatile but was banged up in 2023, producing 45 catches for 559 yards and 5 touchdowns. The Colts' top receivers only missed one game last season, that's unlikely to happen again. Their new weapon for Richardson isn't the answer when he, too, deals with time on the sideline.\n\nRound 4, Pick 117: Tanor Bortolini, C/G, Wisconsin\n\nColts Pro Bowl center Ryan Kelly said the team has not engaged in contract extension talks. To prepare for a life without Kelly and provide competition for right guard Will Fries, the pick is Tanor Bortolini. But in addition to not picking up immediate help for Richardson, Bortolini turns out to be a solid addition, but not an improvement on Kelly or Fries.\n\nOther selections\n\nThe Colts are still chasing the missed opportunities in free agency by taking another edge, Javon Solomon out of Troy. He was incredibly productive with 16 sacks, but he's undersized at 6-1, 246 pounds and his performance against major college teams raised questions. ... With a muddled safety depth chart after Julian Blackmon, the Colts tab Ohio State's Josh Proctor. But he turns into more of the same, a solid backup but not a playmaker. ... Southeast Missouri State's Ryan Flournoy wraps up the draft as the Colts seek a kick returner.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Isaiah Rodgers was in line to anchor the cornerback position, but his gambling suspension ended his tenure with the Colts. A reach on a mid-round quarterback didn't work out.\n\nInsider: Who will the Colts take in the NFL Draft? Latest seven-round mock draft for Indianapolis\n\nThe Colts needed a receiver as T.Y. Hilton and Parris Campbell were coming off an injury-interrupted 2019, when Zach Pascal was their leading receiver. Pittman has 336 career receptions for 3,662 yards and 15 touchdowns. The team's WR1 recently signed a 3-year contract worth up to $70 million.\n\nThe Colts traded up to select Taylor, and the acquisition quickly paid dividends. He rushed for 1,169 yards as a rookie and was the NFL's leading rusher in 2021 (1,811 yards). He 4,582 career yards and 40 rushing TDs, is under contract through 2026 and can earn up to $42 million.\n\nThe pick was considered a bit risky because Blackmon was coming off an injury-interrupted 2019 season at the University of Utah. He is the anchor of the Colts' safety position, getting in on 88 tackles in 2023 and leading with 4 interceptions. He tested free agency and re-signed with the Colts for one year at $3.9 million.\n\nHe was available if Philip Rivers (2020) or Carson Wentz (2021) didn't work out. Eason appeared in one game for the Colts and was released in 2021.\n\nHe missed the 2023 season due to an ankle injury. Pinter was a reserve offensive lineman the previous three seasons, scoring a touchdown in 2021. He signed a one-year contract in the offseason for one year at $1.22 million.\n\nRodgers, who came to the Colts as a kick returner, developed into a reliable cornerback in his third season. He was suspended for breaking NFL gambling rules in June 2023 and released by the Colts.\n\nHe was with the Colts for three seasons, getting 10 catches, 1 for a TD.\n\nHe played for the Colts for two years, primarily on special teams.

Thomas brings an element of vertical explosiveness from the Z-receiver position, and he would make an ideal complement to Michael Pittman Jr. on the outside. There was a report that he's dealing with a shoulder injury, and it's unclear how that might impact his draft stock. However, his talent on the field is a perfect match for what the Colts need at wide receiver.\n\nIn terms of pure need, the safety position might top the list for the Colts. However, the value in the draft likely won't match up a whole lot when it comes to the early picks. On Day 2, though, there's intriguing talent, and Hicks is among that crop. He's an elite athlete with versatility to play both strong and free safety.\n\nWith a young cornerback room, Hart would be an intriguing addition.

General manager Chris Ballard has been effective in the draft during his eight seasons with the Colts, but here's a look at how it could all go wrong starting Thursday night.\n\nThe Colts enter the draft with two obvious needs -- receiver and cornerback - but after focusing on re-signing their own free agents, they might take some chances in pursuit of increasing the team's ceiling while trying to compensate for the lack of outside free agents.\n\nDespite tight end Brock Bowers still being on the board, Colts go with athletic cornerback Quinyon Mitchell to provide depth for a young group of cornerbacks after not adding on the outside in free agency. Mitchell scored a 9.75 RAS score - and Ballard loves his athletic prospects - so you can't question the need or promise, but what will the adjustment period be for Toledo player? Passing on a highly rated receiver to support second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson is a mistake.\n\nThe Colts set an Indianapolis record with 51 sacks last season, but teams were using max protection schemes at the end of the year and taking advantage of the inexperienced secondary. Adisa Isaac is the top-rated pass rusher left on the board but turns out to be more of the same: Good player but not the explosive playmaker the team needs to compensate for its secondary.\n\nMore about the draft: When the Colts pick in NFL Draft 2024\n\nHaving to chase the areas not addressed in free agency, the Colts don't get Richardson any help until the third round. Jalen McMillan is fast and versatile but was banged up in 2023, producing 45 catches for 559 yards and 5 touchdowns. The Colts' top receivers only missed one game last season, that's unlikely to happen again. Their new weapon for Richardson isn't the answer when he, too, deals with time on the sideline.\n\nColts Pro Bowl center Ryan Kelly said the team has not engaged in contract extension talks. To prepare for a life without Kelly and provide competition for right guard Will Fries, the pick is Tanor Bortolini. But in addition to not picking up immediate help for Richardson, Bortolini turns out to be a solid addition, but not an improvement on Kelly or Fries.\n\nThe Colts are still chasing the missed opportunities in free agency by taking another edge, Javon Solomon out of Troy. He was incredibly productive with 16 sacks, but he's undersized at 6-1, 246 pounds and his performance against major college teams raised questions. ... With a muddled safety depth chart after Julian Blackmon, the Colts tab Ohio State's Josh Proctor. But he turns into more of the same, a solid backup but not a playmaker. ...

Unlike in 2023, the Indianapolis Colts aren't picking fourth overall in the NFL Draft, and they don't need a quarterback. Anthony Richardson is here, and he's the future. This time around, Indianapolis' first pick isn't until No. 15, and the team will have just one pick in each round when the 2024 draft begins Thursday night.\n\nThough QB is settled, the Colts have a few big needs and could go in several different directions. With that in mind, here is my final big board featuring 40 prospects the Colts should consider through all three days of the draft. They are listed in order of their ranking on Dane Brugler's list of top 300 prospects.\n\nThe Colts would have to visit \"fantasy land\" to trade up and draft Harrison, according to Colts GM Chris Ballard, but I couldn't make a big board without the son of a Colts legend. Harrison is widely viewed as a generational prospect whose athleticism and polished skill set make him a threat from anywhere on the field.\n\nIndy would have to trade up to select Nabers, but probably not as high as Harrison. Nabers is a master of acceleration and deceleration, according to Brugler, which usually helps him shake free from even the stickiest coverages.\n\nIf the board falls just right and the Colts want to be aggressive, I think Odunze is the most realistic big-time receiver they could land. Again, Indianapolis would need to trade up for the talented wideout, who plays extremely well through contact and routinely makes contested catches.\n\nBowers is the only tight end in this year's class to receive a first-round grade from Brugler. He's been compared to 49ers star George Kittle and former Colts star Dallas Clark. Obviously, if Indianapolis gave Richardson a player like that to work with, it would instantly boost the team's offensive firepower.\n\nThe Colts need another starting-caliber cornerback, and Arnold could be the answer. Arnold has a joyous and infectious personality, but don't let that fool you. He's a tenacious defender, whom Brugler compared to Bears star cornerback Jaylon Johnson.\n\nIf the Colts are looking for a shutdown cornerback, Mitchell may be their guy. He's my personal favorite in this year's class and offers a bit more athleticism than Arnold. Mitchell obviously didn't face the same level of competition as Arnold, but his tape speaks for itself. His route recognition, anticipation and ball skills set him apart.\n\nIndianapolis still lacks an elite edge rusher, so perhaps it would take a swing on Turner. The 2023 SEC Defensive Player of the Year has all the physical tools to continue wreaking havoc in the NFL. Turner is ranked as Brugler's No. 1 edge rusher in this year's class, and he's a very coachable player, according to the Alabama staff.\n\nI think Thomas is the most realistic high-end wideout the Colts could land if they stay put at No. 15. He's an explosive player with the kind of big-play ability that would really open up Indianapolis' offense. Brugler compared Thomas' upside, in a best-case scenario, to be on par with Bengals star Tee Higgins.\n\nVerse has one of the most inspiring NFL Draft stories. He didn't have any FBS scholarship offers after high school, began his college career at FCS Albany and parlayed that into a chance to eventually star at Florida State. Now, his violent hands and relentless motor have turned him into a highly coveted NFL prospect.\n\nLatu is a pass-rush technician with an array of moves in his arsenal to pair with his impressive flexibility. The biggest red flag on Latu, which the Colts and other teams will certainly consider, is his medical history. Latu sustained a neck injury in 2020 that forced him to medically retire in 2021 before returning to the field and dominating in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWiggins ran a 4.28 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine, and his blazing speed shows up on tape with how quickly he's able to recover even after he's initially beaten. His frame is a bit concerning at just 173 pounds and could make Ballard pass on him altogether. However, if the Colts were to trade back in the first round and Wiggins was still available, his upside may be worth the risk.\n\nDeJean wouldn't be my first choice at cornerback in this year's class, but if the Colts traded back a few spots, this would be a strong pick. The former four-sport high school star possesses elite athleticism and could be a perfect fit for Indianapolis defensive coordinator Gus Bradley's zone-heavy scheme.\n\nMcKinstry is another starting-caliber cornerback the Colts could target if they trade back in the first round. He's a disruptive yet disciplined defender, evidenced by his seven pass breakups and zero penalties last year.\n\nKneeland isn't as bendy as NFL teams would likely prefer, be he still has adequate size and length to constantly make his presence felt up front. Brugler said Kneeland's best football \"is yet to come.\"\n\nMitchell's size, speed and strong hands could make him a game-changing receiver at the next level. If the Colts pass on a wideout in the first round, Mitchell wouldn't be a bad consolation prize in the second -- if he falls that far. His presence alone would force defenses to shift their coverage, while opening up the field more for Richardson to distribute the ball to the Colts' other pass catchers.\n\nGeorgia coach Kirby Smart said Robinson, \"is one of the hardest guys to block in our league,\" according to Brugler. He has the ideal size, length and power to build on a dominant 2023 college campaign, which featured 14 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks.\n\nColeman made some highlight-reel catches last year that made me believe he could eventually become a No. 1 receiver in the NFL. He isn't the fastest guy and needs to clean up his route running, but when the ball is in the air, Coleman has a good chance of coming down with it.\n\nThe Colts' starting free safety spot isn't solidified, and Hicks looks like he could fit the bill. He's a rangy and versatile defender on the backend with a knack for lowering the boom when necessary.\n\nPearsall played one season with Richardson at Florida, so perhaps a familiar face could benefit Richardson's development. But more important than their relationship is Pearsall's skill set. Although he primarily lined up in the slot at Florida, his size and speed could make him a threat on the outside, too.\n\nColts head coach Shane Steichen and wide receivers coach Reggie Wayne both got a closer look at Worthy (and Mitchell) during Texas' pro day. Worthy set the combine record with a 4.21-second 40-yard dash and will add a lethal downfield element to any NFL offense he joins. I also think he's an underrated route runner and can be more than just a deep threat.\n\nFranklin is another speedy wideout who can take the top off a defense and make something special happen if he gets the ball in his hands with any daylight. Although Franklin is 6-foot-1, he weighed in at just 176 pounds at the combine, so that could be a bit concerning for his long-term durability.\n\nMelton doesn't have the height Ballard prefers in cornerbacks, standing 5-foot-11, but his speed and other traits could make him an enticing prospect. The 22-year-old still has a 9.09 RAS (relative athletic score) and can play inside or outside.\n\nIsaac plays with a tireless motor and has \"(an) outstanding blend of length, bend and speed,\" according to Brugler. He'll need to improve his pass-rush instincts to parlay his physical gifts into more production in the NFL.\n\nBraswell is a bit undersized, but he makes up for it with his explosiveness and overall athleticism. A two-time member of Bruce Feldman's \"Freaks List,\" Braswell may need some time to develop into a full-time starter at the next level, but his potential is undeniable.\n\nNubin is an instinctive player with a high IQ, which usually keeps him in the right spot on the backend. He's not going to wow anyone with his athleticism, but he's tough and reliable.\n\nBishop is a dynamic athlete, and with a 6-foot-2, 206-pound frame, he fits the Ballard mold like a glove. He made his presence felt all over the backend during his time at Utah and isn't afraid to lower the boom if he's asked to make a play near the line of scrimmage. The Colts did well the last time they drafted a safety from Utah (Julian Blackmon.)\n\nLegette only had one productive season at South Carolina, which was last year, but it's hard to overlook the 1,255 receiving yards and seven TDs he tallied when things finally clicked for him. Brugler said Legette gives him \"DK Metcalf vibes\" thanks to his big-bodied frame and game-breaking speed.\n\nTrice doesn't have ideal length or speed, but his hands are violent, and his motor is tireless. The latter two traits could still help him grow into being an impactful NFL player, despite his other deficiencies.\n\nLinebacker isn't a pressing need for the Colts, but they don't have much depth behind Zaire Franklin and E.J. Speed, so it may not be a bad idea to add another linebacker to the mix. Wilson has a lengthy injury history, though it would be hard to tell based on the impressive range and physicality he put on display in 2023.\n\nThe Colts drafted a North Carolina wide receiver last year in Josh Downs, and Walker could be talented enough to make them want to come back for seconds. He'll need to diversify his route running in the NFL, though his speed and big-play prowess will make him a threat whenever he's on the field.\n\nThe Colts' backup running back duties are up for grabs, and Allen could be the player to fill that void. He compiled 3,494 rushing yards and 35 rushing TDs at Wisconsin and would likely thrive in a lesser role alongside a dual-threat QB.\n\nBortolini, who started at center last year, has started at least one game in college at every position on the offensive line except for left tackle. His experience and versatility project him to be a backup early on in the NFL, with starting potential down the line.\n\nTracy can sometimes struggle to make the right read at the line of scrimmage, but you know who could help a lot with that? The Colts' dual-threat QB, Richardson. He would make life much easier on Tracy, so all he'd have to do is run hard and get upfield. Tracy is also a stout blocker in pass protection.\n\nLimmer is an impressive athlete for his size and a weight-room legend at Arkansas. He \"projects as an immediate backup (center and guard) with starting potential at center,\" according to Brugler. With Ryan Kelly's future in Indy uncertain, drafting his heir would make sense.\n\nA former walk-on at Illinois, Reiman is a bit of a late bloomer, but he has great size and athleticism that give him promising upside in the NFL. He'll need time to develop, though if the Colts picked him, he could be viewed as Mo Alie-Cox's long-term replacement if he excels as a blocker early on. Keep in mind, Alie-Cox is entering the final year of his contract.\n\nGuerendo is another traits-over-production prospect. He didn't have an illustrious career at Louisville, but his final year was productive enough for a team to likely take a Day-3 swing on the athletic ball carrier.\n\nHart stands at 6-foot-3 and weighs 202 pounds, making him a massive CB. He's the type of player Ballard may consider based on his physical traits. He must improve his footwork to survive in the NFL, but at least that's teachable, whereas his size and athleticism are not.\n\nUlofoshio never gives up on a play and always finds himself around the ball thanks to his relentless motor. He may never become a starter in the NFL, but his physical gifts make him an enticing Day 3 pick. At a minimum, Ulofoshio projects as a core special teamer.\n\nStanding 6-foot-8 and weighing 313 pounds, Crum is a towering figure with plenty of experience. He'll need to refine his technique at the next level, but his strength and IQ make him an ideal candidate for a swing tackle role.\n\nIsaiah McKenzie joined the Giants in free agency, leaving the Colts with a need for a backup slot receiver and return man.

Latest seven-round mock draft for Indianapolis", "body": "Indianapolis Colts general manager Chris Ballard holds his predraft press conference.\n\nThe NFL Draft is this week. It offers another chance for Chris Ballard and the Indianapolis Colts to build the way they always do, which is by drafting and developing. They have a few needs to address, but this is also the way they acquire building block players for the long haul.\n\nIt's a different draft than last year, when everyone knew they were going with a quarterback. They have a few different routes they could take, but here's one hypothetical done through the NFL Mock Draft Database's simulator.\n\nFor this exercise, I chose not to make any trades, though we know Ballard will end up making some as he always does. I mostly chose from the players available but did pass on a couple of players I can't see actually being available at that slot.\n\nIndianapolis Colts mock draft\n\nThe Colts have seven picks in this year's draft, one per round, starting with No. 15 overall. They have a major hole in the secondary, primarily at outside cornerback, but also have a need for another pass catcher for Richardson. They can always use more pass rush help, too.\n\nRound 1, Pick 15: Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nThe Colts need a pass catcher for Richardson who goes beyond Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs. Ideally, that comes at tight end, where Jelani Woods has durability questions and the Colts don't have any other established options.\n\nBrock Bowers is the perfect pick if the Colts were to stay at No. 15 and he becomes available. He's the only first-round caliber tight end in the draft, one of the best yards-after-catch prospects in years and a man who led Georgia in receiving in three straight seasons en route to two national championships. He'll be a perfect fit for Shane Steichen's screen- and run-pass-option-heavy playbook and should be able to hit the ground running as their No. 1 tight end.\n\nThe Colts could use, at minimum, a No. 4 wide receiver and ideally someone who can push Alec Pierce as a starting 'Z' receiver. They get that and more in Xavier Worthy, who is projected to sneak into the first round.\n\nIt means double-dipping on pass catchers, but this spring is all about developing Richardson, so the Colts won't mind. Steichen can always find use for more talented offensive weapons. This one happens to have gone for 1,000 yards in the Big 12 Conference last season and is an electric return man with his blistering 4.21-second 40-yard dash time. That's something else Indianapolis needs to address in this draft.\n\nRound 3, Pick 18: Adisa Isaac, EDGE, Penn State\n\nThe Colts clearly want to build their pass defense primarily through the pass rush. They have potential future needs forming on the edge with Dayo Odeyingbo and Kwity Paye entering contract years. It makes for a fit with Adisa Isaac, a player who made a strong impression at the Senior Bowl after breaking out with 16 tackles-for-loss and 7.5 sacks in the Big Ten last season.\n\nHe'll start as a situational pass rusher, someone to step in to give a little more juice than Paye can on third downs. It means keeping the secondary a major need, but that's how the draft is falling, and that's also a position that has free agents to sign after the draft.\n\nRound 4, Pick 17: Cam Hart, CB, Notre Dame\n\nThe Colts finally add to their secondary with a player built ideally for their press-man, zone-heavy scheme. Cam Hart measures 6-foot-3 and 202 pounds, making him a strong complement to JuJu Brents and Jaylon Jones in this young room. He handled covering Marvin Harrison Jr. about as well as any cornerback last season, showing off traits that can be developed.\n\nHe'll need seasoning, much like Jones did, but he gives the Colts a third cornerback who can split reps at a position that's becoming hodgepodge in nature.\n\nRound 5, Pick 16: Audric Estime, RB, Notre Dame\n\nThe Colts double-dip on Fighting Irish prospects with Audric Estime, who falls to the fifth round. Estime was a workhorse the past two seasons, totaling 2,261 yards and 29 rushing touchdowns. He doesn't have the top-end speed of some other backs but runs with power and can catch out of the backfield, making him an ideal Zack Moss replacement as the top backup and goal-line option to Jonathan Taylor.\n\nRound 6, Pick 15: Edefuan Ulofoshio, LB, Washington\n\nThe Colts are into their depth picks now. Edefuan Ulofoshio is a sixth-year player without elite measurables but was a big-time leader on a defense that played for the national championship last season, when he racked up 94 tackles and eight tackles-for-loss. He brings a lot of the characteristics that Zaire Franklin once did and can be the next linebacker the Colts start on special teams and try to develop from there.\n\nRound 7, Pick 14: Joe Milton, QB, Tennessee\n\nThe all-big-school draft is complete with a quarterback who mirrors Richardson in some interesting ways. Joe Milton stands a giant 6-5 and 235 pounds. Last year at Tennessee, he threw for 20 touchdowns and ran for seven more. That was his sixth year in college, and the lack of development has led to questions about how he can fit at the next level. But as a seventh-round swing, he can slide in as the Colts' No. 3 quarterback behind two similarly framed passers in Richardson and Joe Flacco, which also makes a great room to learn from.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pittman_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Pittman Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelani_Woods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jelani Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Pierce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alec Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayo_Odeyingbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dayo Odeyingbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwity_Paye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kwity Paye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penn State Nittany Lions football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zack Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaire_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaire Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/images/smg/2024/04/25/USAT/73438166007-USATSI_21559614-e1713969460743.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=5973,3359,x1084,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The benefit of this being Chris Ballard's eighth draft as general manager of the Colts is that there is a well-documented history of the types of moves he likes to make.\n\nThe NFL Draft is unpredictable. The foremost experts on the draft could correctly guess just 20% of the first-round selections and that would be regarded as a great success. What if we're overthinking this? What if the key to predicting what the Colts will do is to look at exactly what the Colts have already done and make our predictions that way? Maybe the surprise in this year's draft for the Colts is that there will be no surprises.\n\nAssuredly, that won't be the case, but this mock draft is an exercise to that point. Looking back at past drafts and finding the overall selections that the Colts have owned that most closely reflect their current arsenal of picks, we can see how the Colts handled those picks and project who they might target this year when in a similar situation.\n\nClosest selections: Malik Hooker, 2017 (Pick 15), Trade for Deforest Buckner, 2020 (Pick 13)\n\nIn Ballard's eighth draft, he finds himself with the same overall selection in the first round he had in his first draft as a general manager. 2017 is an outlier among the rest of Ballard's drafts. Having just a few months to prepare and drafting players to play under a returning head coach (whom he did not hire) in Chuck Pagano, led to decisions that would be revealed as uncharacteristic of a standard Colts draft under Ballard. However, we can find some parallels that could aid in predicting what Ballard is willing to do with a pick in the teens.\n\nThe pick: Brock Bowers, Tight End, Georgia\n\nStaying put at pick No.15 in 2017, the Colts watched as a player ranked in the top ten on consensus big boards fell into their laps. Malik Hooker did not perform any athletic tests during the pre-draft process and this lack of measurables could have been part of the reason he slipped out of the top ten.\n\nThis year there is another player on the consensus top ten boards who did not do any athletic testing. If Brock Bowers experiences a fall similar to that of Hooker seven years later, the Colts should be excited to see history repeat itself.\n\nJust for fun:\n\nThe Colts have owned a pick in the teens two other times in Chris Ballard's tenure, and each was traded away. The most recent was their 2022 first-round pick (No.16 overall), a conditional pick given away in the Carson Wentz trade. The more straightforward example would be the 2020 first-rounder (No.13 overall) which was given in a straight swap for defensive tackle DeForest Buckner.\n\nThis offseason, another San Francisco player could be on the move. Brandon Aiyuk has generated a lot of buzz around the league as a potential trade target for teams looking for an impact wide receiver. The Colts certainly fit that mold and with the recent extension of the aforementioned Buckner, the Colts could find a way to make the financial aspect of a trade and imminent extension work.\n\nClosest picks: Jonathan Taylor, 2020 (Traded Pick 46 for 41), Quincy Wilson, 2017 (Pick 46)\n\nOwning the No.46 overall selection in round two is not unfamiliar for the Colts in recent drafts. As mentioned, the 2017 draft appears to be an outlier when compared to the rest of the Colts' drafts under Chris Ballard. So with two exact matches to choose from, this selection will model the strategy of the more recent option.\n\nTRADE: Colts send the No.46 (second round) and No.151 (fifth round) picks to the Green Bay Packers for the No.41 (second round) pick.\n\nThe pick: Xavier Legette, Wide Receiver, South Carolina\n\nIn 2020, when trying to decide whether to choose Michael Pittman Jr. or Jonathan Taylor, the Colts decided why not both? In an attempt to try to add more explosion to their offense, after selecting one offensive weapon, they traded up to ensure they were able to add a second weapon that checked all of their boxes.\n\nAfter the selection of Bowers in the first round, the Colts follow the same formula they did in 2020 and make a play for Xavier Legette, a tier-1 Build-A-Ballard fit.\n\nClosest picks: Tarell Basham, 2017 (Pick 80), Julian Blackmon, 2020 (Pick 85), Josh Downs, 2023 (Pick 79)\n\nIn round three, the Colts have generally addressed team needs with players who can contribute early. The Colts have never owned pick 82 exactly, but they have made several selections within ten slots of where they sit in 2024.\n\nThe pick: Cole Bishop, Safety, Utah\n\nIn 2020 the Colts drafted Julian Blackmon to compete for a starting role on the defense. They did this via a trade-down from pick 75 to pick 85 and a trade-down could certainly be in the cards here as well if only to recoup a sixth or seventh-rounder.\n\nWith a Utah safety available at this spot, though, the fit is too perfect to resist. Once again reliving day two of the 2020 draft, the Colts select Cole Bishop to compete for a starting role immediately in the back end of a young secondary and provide insurance for the possible departure of Blackmon next offseason, the same way Blackmon did for Hooker in 2021.\n\nWhat happens next for the Colts?

Instead, with picks in this range, the Colts have looked towards the future, drafting players who have great traits, but likely need to sit for a year before becoming a serious contributor.\n\nThe pick: Mason McCormick, Guard, South Dakota State\n\nFinding similarities between the two past precedent picks in this range, quarterback Eason and defensive tackle Adetomiwa Adebawore is not easy. Eason was a prospect with great size, but not great athleticism while Adebawore was an undersized prospect with elite athleticism. Eason had an elite trait, though -- a rocket for an arm. Both players were drafted because of their elite traits and expected to sit back for at least a year and develop before being needed in any significant role.\n\nThe Colts employ the same thinking here with the selection of Mason McCormick. McCormick is an elite athlete on the interior of the offensive line and with nearly every snap returning to the team this season along the offensive line, ideally the Colts would like to future-proof themselves in case of the departures of Ryan Kelly and/or Will Fries at the end of this season.\n\nClosest picks: Danny Pinter, 2020 (Pick 149), Daniel Scott, 2023 (Pick 158), Eric Johnson, 2022 (Pick 159)\n\nTraded with No.46 to the Green Bay Packers for the No.41 (second round) pick.\n\nClosest picks: Drew Ogletree, 2022 (Pick 192), Robert Windsor, 2021 (Pick 193)\n\nIt becomes a little more difficult to find resemblances between past picks around the range of the Colts' selections when also factoring in the previous picks in this mock and trying to produce a well-rounded draft class. Drew Ogletree was picked just one spot away from the Colts' selection at 191, but with the Colts already addressing tight end and then adding a second pass catcher in round two, they look towards the defensive side of the ball.\n\nThe pick: Curtis Jacobs, Linebacker, Penn State\n\nSitting just two picks away from the spot they hold this year, in 2021 the Colts selected a productive defender out of Penn State to compete for a depth role in a position group with established starters. Defensive tackle Robert Windsor was chosen with the 193rd overall selection to join a unit that had Buckner and Grover Stewart, but little depth behind them.\n\nHere, the Colts have their eye on Happy Valley once again and select linebacker Curtis Jacobs to compete for a roster spot behind starters Zaire Franklin and E.J. Speed. Both Windsor and Jacobs measured on the smaller end for their positions and posted good, but not elite athletic testing numbers.\n\nClosest picks: Zaire Franklin, 2018 (Pick 235), Jake Witt, 2023 (Pick 236)\n\nThe emphasis on acquiring great athletes is apparent even with the Colts' final draft choices each year. With the Colts selecting two athletic offensive tackles on day three last year, and adding another guard in the fourth round of this mock, they again address the defense.\n\nThe pick: Javontae Jean-Baptiste, Edge, Notre Dame\n\nArguably Chris Ballard's best find came in the seventh round, just one spot later than the 234th selection they currently own. Franklin was an undersized senior defender who posted great athletic testing numbers at his pro day.\n\nWith the 234th pick, the Colts follow this mold and once again select an overlooked senior defender who boasts great athletic traits, but measures in a little small for his position. Edge defender Javontae Jean-Baptiste rounds out the 2024 Colts draft class as an older rookie who still has room to develop.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Still, it's a good idea to know who is on the market for when the Colts come out of the draft weekend.\n\nThanks to the two-year contract extension from DeForest Buckner, the Colts have roughly $24.77 million in effective salary-cap space entering the draft, according to Over The Cap. That ranks seventh in the NFL.\n\nSN's NFL DRAFT HQ\n\nLive picks tracker | 7-round mock draft | Top 250 big board\n\nThe talented safety is still on the market likely waiting to see where his market lands following the draft. The Colts re-signed Julian Blackmon, but they could still afford to add some talent to the safety room.\n\nThe former Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions safety is still on the market. Again, the Colts re-signed Blackmon to a one-year deal, but Diggs is still talented enough to make a solid impact in the safety room.\n\nA reunion with Gilmore wouldn't be a bad idea even though the Colts could wind up using an early pick on a prospect at the cornerback position. Gilmore would provide a solid veteran presence in the Colts secondary just as he did in 2022.\n\nIf the Colts felt like adding another edge rusher to the rotation under new defensive line coach Charlie Partridge, Dupree could be an option. He started 16 games for the Atlanta Falcons in 2023 and was tied for the team lead in sacks with 6.5.\n\nThough Maye has dealt with injuries in recent seasons, he could be another veteran option the Colts lean on for a one-year deal. The Colts would have to look past the injuries, though, as he's appeared in 23 games over the last three seasons.\n\nThe offensive line for the Colts is essentially set, but Hubbard might be an intriguing option if they wanted to bring in some veteran competition for second-year swing tackle Blake Freeland, who had some struggles with consistency during his rookie campaign.\n\nThe massive defensive tackle is simply a disruption machine. Even at the age of 37 with the Falcons in 2023, Campbell still put together 6.5 sacks, 17 quarterback hits and 10 tackles for loss. An interior defensive line with Campbell, DeForest Buckner and Grover Stewart would be lethal.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeForest_Buckner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeForest Buckner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Freeland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blake Freeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grover Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/Stephon%20Gilmore%2012202023-COLLAGE.jpg?itok=dnIeG2Gx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The 2024 NFL Draft is nearly upon us.\n\nFor the Indianapolis Colts, the weight of needing to find a franchise quarterback is finally off of their shoulders (at least for now), and they can focus on fortifying the roster and building a contender around Anthony Richardson.\n\nWhile this year's draft is rich and top heavy at positions where the Colts have needs, still none of us know for sure which direction they'll go like we did last year. That's what makes this year's draft so fun already, right?\n\nToday, I bring you my one and only seven-round Colts mock draft of the year. After months of studying, combing back over press conferences from general manager Chris Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen, and observing on-site at the Reese's Senior Bowl, the Scouting Combine, and a few pro days, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on what the vibe of the Colts' draft class may resemble (if they have it their way).\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nThe Colts move back right off the bat, sending the 15th overall pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for 1:20, 3:84, and 6:178. In selecting Thomas, the Colts get a supercharged version of Alec Pierce who is also able to provide some juice after the catch. Thomas is an elite-level field stretcher who produced numbers at LSU despite not being the first option in the passing game, leading the country with 17 touchdown receptions in 2023. I believe the main goal for the Colts in this draft is to support Richardson, and this is a great first step.\n\nIsaac is exactly the type of pass-rusher that Ballard and the Colts typically covet. He's got a speed rusher's build (6'4\", 247) with nearly 34-inch arms, is a high-level athlete (8.99 RAS), and his best football is likely still ahead of him after reaching just 14.5 sacks in his four playing seasons. The Colts may look to add a pass rusher in the first couple of days in the draft with Kwity Paye, Dayo Odeyingbo, Samson Ebukam, and Tyquan Lewis all set for free agency in the next two offseasons.\n\nDuring his pre-draft press conference last week, Ballard singled out the football IQ of defenders from Georgia. I'm probably taking this too literally like he had one of this year's players in mind, but Bullard is my top safety in this draft, so this is a selfish one for me. Still, Bullard's versatility and instincts are easily translatable to the NFL, and he's more athletic than a lot of the rest of this year's safety class. Outside of Julian Blackmon, can you say with certainty who the Colts' other starting safety will be? Bullard has the smarts, instincts, and athleticism to do the job. He's also able to be moved around the secondary like Blackmon.\n\nA lot of us will look to add a corner for the Colts before the third round, but I think they like their group better than most outsiders and don't see it as quite as urgent of a need. Jones checks the boxes of a Ballard/Gus Bradley corner, measuring in at over 6'1\" and 185 pounds, with explosive athletic testing and 4.44 speed. In coverage, he's somewhat similar to JuJu Brents as a lengthy, physical corner who loves to compete for the ball when it's in the air. Jones had 7 interceptions and 21 pass breakups combined over the last two seasons. He is not as gritty against the run as Brents but it's not a deal breaker.\n\nThe Colts are in good shape at starting linebacker with Zaire Franklin and E.J. Speed, but Speed and all of the team's meaningful backups are free agents next offseason. The Colts also have a need for a linebacker who excels in coverage and space, and that's Ulofoshio's game. He's one of the most athletic linebackers in the draft (9.67 RAS) and would likely contribute on special teams immediately.\n\nAfter missing out on decent names like Zack Moss and A.J. Dillon in free agency, I'm not convinced that the Colts are satisfied with their running backs behind Jonathan Taylor. Guerendo is broad like Moss and Dillon at 6'0\", 221 but mixes it with awesome athleticism, notching the second-best RAS (9.90) among all running backs in this year's class. Guerendo is a former high school wide receiver who actually learned from Taylor how to be a running back when the two were together at Wisconsin.\n\nThis is a great year for the Colts to stay on brand as they begin finding super athletic offensive linemen from small schools on Day 3. Along with adding weapons for Richardson, Ballard also mentioned last week multiple times the need to protect their quarterback. They did bring back their entire offensive line from last year, depth and all, but there's still a need for competition and to maintain that high level of play for the foreseeable future. Crum notched the second-best RAS (9.86) of all tackles in this class and is a four-year starter at both left and right tackle.\n\nThe Colts find more competition at safety but a core special teamer as well in Taylor. Like Bullard before him, Taylor is another safety in this class who actually checked off the \"quality athlete\" box, earning a RAS of 9.33, which is good for fifth in the class. He has great size at 6'0\", 213, and has the mentality to attack downhill, totaling a combined 13.5 sacks and tackles for loss in his career while also having good ball production with 6 interceptions and 13 pass breakups. Most impressive is that Taylor won the Jim Thorpe Award last year as the top defensive back in the country, which is incredibly rare for a player from one of the military academies.\n\nThe Colts found offensive tackle depth from a small school two picks ago, and now they find interior small-school depth with their final pick. Colts interior linemen Ryan Kelly, Will Fries, Wesley French, and Josh Sills are all set to be free agents next offseason, so the need for depth is there right way. Kubas is yet another big-time athlete, reaching a RAS score of 9.44. He's got plenty of experience starting inside for the last three years, and his athleticism shows up when you see his jump off the snap and ability to get to the second and third levels.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_arthur@si.com", "name": "Jake Arthur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Richardson_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Richardson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Pierce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alec Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Steichen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Steichen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayo_Odeyingbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dayo Odeyingbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwity_Paye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kwity Paye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gus Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyquan_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyquan Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zack Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaire_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaire Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Kelly_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Kelly (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6692,h_3764,x_0,y_198/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hw78626xmre3z5acjs", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The Colts signed just two outside free agents, picking up Raekwon Davis to provide depth at defensive tackle and Joe Flacco to fill Gardner Minshew's place at backup quarterback.\n\nBarring any more signings, the Colts must address their list of needs in the NFL Draft, a place where Indianapolis general manager Chris Ballard typically uses his top picks to address the team's area of greatest need. With that in mind, here is a look at the positions Indianapolis still has to fill.\n\n1. The Colts need a cornerback. Who fits?\n\nIndianapolis brought back Kenny Moore II, the veteran linchpin in a position room full of young players. Ballard has repeatedly sung the praises of young outside cornerbacks Jaylon Jones, JuJu Brents and Dallis Flowers, but the trio remain unproven as No. 1-style cornerbacks, and both Brents and Flowers are coming off injury-plagued seasons. If the Colts decide to address their biggest need at No. 15, Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell, Alabama's Terrion Arnold and Iowa's Cooper DeJean appear to the best fits for Ballard's type, elite, versatile athletes with a knack for making plays on the ball.\n\n2. The Colts need a wide receiver. Who fits?\n\nOnly Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Josh Downs played more than 125 snaps at wide receiver for Indianapolis last season, and the Colts currently have no obvious options on the roster who can challenge one of those three for playing time or step into a starter's role if one of those players are gone. Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen craves explosive qualities in skill players, making an elite deep threat or a player with explosive abilities after-the-catch the best fit for the offense.\n\nColts draft order: When they pick in NFL Draft 2024\n\nThe top three receivers in the draft (Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers and Rome Odunze) will likely be gone at No. 15, leaving LSU's Brian Thomas Jr. and Texas's Xavier Worthy as first-round options who fit. Beyond the first round, Oregon's Troy Franklin, South Carolina's Xavier Legette and Western Kentucky's Malachi Corley could fit the Colts' desire for explosive plays in one way or the other.\n\n3. The Colts need a safety. Who fits?\n\nIndianapolis brought back Julian Blackmon after the veteran strong safety turned in the best year of his career in 2023, but Blackmon's injury history and the inconsistencies of the team's young tandem at free safety, Nick Cross and Rodney Thomas II, leave an opening for players at both spots. The 2024 safety class is thin in the draft, making a first-round selection unlikely, but Washington State's Jaden Hicks, Georgia's Javon Bullard and Utah's Cole Bishop could fit on Friday, with Texas Tech's Dadrion Taylor-Demerson looming as an option later in the draft.\n\n4. The Colts need a linebacker. Who fits?\n\nIndianapolis has locked up Zaire Franklin for the foreseeable future, but weak-side starter E.J. Speed is headed into the final year of his contract, and the options behind them lack a clear starting option in the event of injury, although the Colts have proven to be adept at developing little-known special teamers into starters. If the Colts want to address the position through the draft, Texas A&M's Edgerrin Cooper is an early-round option who fits what Ballard likes in linebackers -- but the Indianapolis general manager has also found several starters at linebacker on the third and final day of the draft.\n\n5. The Colts need a running back. Who fits?\n\nIndianapolis brought back Trey Sermon after a few flashes, and the Colts get back fifth-rounder Evan Hull this season, but there is still a spot open in the backfield for another player who could handle the load if Jonathan Taylor goes down again. An early pick is unlikely, but Ballard has found depth pieces on Day 3 in the past. Clemson's Will Shipley, Purdue's Tyrone Tracy and Louisville's Isaac Guerendo all have the explosive speed Steichen likes in his skill-position players.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "joel_a_erickson@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Joel A.

Trading down? Colts are all over the place in NFL mock drafts", "body": "The Colts hold the No. 15 pick in the first round and one pick in Rounds 2-7, but general manager Chris Ballard isn't averse to making deals to acquire more selections.\n\nIn the mock drafts below, the Colts' draft position varies wildly. Sometimes they're trading up, others moving down. And the consensus that they will take a cornerback in the first round has largely disappeared.\n\nMore likely: Colts typically draft for need, and Indy has two obvious needs to fill\n\nThe Colts look to make a statement with Bowers, who I'm honestly having a hard time slotting in this draft. I've seen him compared to George Kittle by NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah, but I'm wondering if that projection assumes Bowers will beef up a little bit and become a stronger blocker. I'm not saying he's a bad blocker, but I've seen him get steered around at times. If he can become an integral part of a run game like Dallas Goedert was for Shane Steichen in Philadelphia, he would make for a great weapon and general offensive upgrade.\n\nSteichen's bread and butter as an NFL coach has been making the simple look complex. Bowers is a big part of that process, with an every-down mismatch on the field.\n\nPro Football Focus: Trade alert\n\nThe Colts move down to No. 29 overall in a trade with the Detroit Lions and select Payton Wilson, LB, N.C. State\n\nIt's a clich\u00e9 to go \"best athlete available\" for the Colts, but Payton Wilson certainly ticked that box at the NFL scouting combine. Wilson was exceptional in his final season at NC State, earning grades above 75.0 in all three facets of defense, led by his 90.0 coverage grade with three interceptions and four forced incompletions.\n\nColts move up to No. 9 overall in a trade with the Chicago Bears and select Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nIf the Bears could get more Day 2 ammunition, I think they'd strongly consider moving down here. For the Colts, it would be a rare move up, but if GM Chris Ballard wants Bowers, he might have to get aggressive to move in front of the Jets. Bowers would be an excellent security blanket for Anthony Richardson and could become Dallas Clark 2.0.\n\nR.J. White, CBS Sports: Trade alert\n\nColts move down to No. 25 overall in a trade with the Green Bay Packers and select Graham Barton, T, Duke\n\nOffensive line isn't seen as an option for the Colts' first pick, but I think it makes a lot of sense, especially if they trade down to this range. Ryan Kelly is a free agent after this year and will be 32 years old in 2024, while Will Fries is also heading into free agency after this season. Barton could be an upgrade on Fries this year and/or the natural successor at center to Kelly with a year to fully train for the position, and he can also provide immediate depth outside should Fries stick as a starter.\n\nJordan Reid, ESPN: Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\n\nWide receiver or cornerback seem to be the two positions in consideration, and Thomas would bring a downfield dynamic that the offense has lacked. Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs were a solid 1-2 punch last season, but when you have Anthony Richardson's huge arm under center, you need vertical threats. Alec Pierce has struggled, so I could see Indy looking to Thomas to create more explosive plays. Thomas led the FBS in touchdown receptions last season (17), and 10 of those came on vertical patterns.\n\nYahoo: Dallas Turner, edge rusher, Alabama\n\nThe Colts could use another quality rusher up front and Turner would find himself in a great spot by being able to play with a star defensive lineman like DeForest Buckner. It's hard to find 21-year-old edge rushers in the draft who also run a 4.47. Don't be surprised if Turner goes much higher than this during the actual draft.\n\nDanny Heifetz, The Ringer: Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nThe Colts are overjoyed to land Bowers at no. 15. Tight end has mystified them for years. Gone are the days of tossing out Jack Doyle and Mo Alie-Cox or having nine tight ends on their 90-man roster. Bowers can do everything. He gives coach Shane Steichen an unreal option and puts second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson in a position to succeed.\n\nWalter Football: Terrion Arnold, CB, Alabama\n\nThe Colts need cornerback help to combat all the firepower the Jaguars and Texans have at receiver. Terrion Arnold is a quick and athletic cornerback with average height.\n\nEvery day of the draft will be shown on NFL Network, ABC and ESPN.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news",

They're not going to take a quarterback, of course. But beyond that certainty, it's hard to entirely rule any one possibility out -- at least if you're willing to go to fantasyland.\n\nThat's what general manager Chris Ballard called at least one hypothetical in an interview with the Rich Eisen Show last week. But when you remove quarterback possibilities from the equation, is a move to any spot in the draft really that out of the question if a team wants to make it happen? Is it possible for things to break perfectly right?\n\nThat's what this piece is going to explore. This is not what I think will happen on Thursday night. It's supposed to not happen, as all bold predictions are.\n\nBut here's how Thursday will go if it were to break perfectly right to allow the Colts to \"ace\" the draft:\n\nColts trade up with the Cardinals\n\nIs a trade up in the first actually something Ballard could do for the first time in his eight-year history as a general manager? I asked him that question last week, and he at least wouldn't rule it out.\n\n\"I think it would depend,\" Ballard said. \"There would have to be somebody within striking distance that we felt was really unique and a difference-maker for us.\"\n\nThe Cardinals are the first team in this year's draft order reported to be aggressively shopping a move down. The expectation going in is that quarterback picks will populate the first three selections -- USC's Caleb Williams to the Bears and then North Carolina's Drake Maye and LSU's Jayden Daniels in some order in the next two picks, owned by the Commanders and Patriots. What the Cardinals would love is if a team like the Vikings would offer the moon to come up for Michigan's JJ McCarthy, and if some team will, this dream dies before it ever takes off.\n\nBut in this scenario, quarterbacks are not going 1-2-3-4, something that has never happened in the history of the draft.\n\nInstead, the Cardinals, hell-bent on a long-term view in building around Kyler Murray and loving the receiver depth in a draft where they have 11 total picks, become open to taking a trade down to No. 15 to secure a future first-round pick, the way they did with the Texans last year when Houston wanted Will Anderson.\n\nI ran the trade through the NFL Mock Draft Database, which rejects offers that are too strong on either end. The Cardinals accepted the following offer:\n\nThe Colts send pick No. 15 this season and their 2025 first-rounder for pick No. 4.\n\nIt allows the Colts to go up for a player they are infatuated with without decreasing the number of picks they have in this draft, which will be enticing to Ballard and the Colts' hopes of addressing a hole in the secondary on Day 2.\n\nBut beyond the price, as Ballard said, it would have to be for the perfect player for the Colts. And in this crazy hypothetical, it is.\n\nColts draft Marvin Harrison Jr. at No. 4 overall\n\nIf we're allowing the Colts to dream, of course that road will lead here. The top offensive weapon in this year's draft just happens to be the son of a Colts Hall-of-Famer who played with their receivers coach. And he's entering the first draft after Anthony Richardson's arrival in Indianapolis. And he played at a school that Ballard loves drafting from.\n\nThe Harrison conversation has gotten weird this spring, as tends to happen when teams and analysts alike have too much time to sit around and second-guess everything. He chose not to work out at either the NFL combine or his pro day, instead sticking in football training mode and skipping the learned drills that can sometimes slow a player's progression into the NFL. Some teams aren't going to love having less data on a player, and some could see it as a personality red flag if they don't know Harrison -- which is the opposite place the Colts are in.\n\nBut his silent spring has allowed receivers like LSU's Malik Nabers and Washington's Rome Odunze to engineer their own hype trains. As Odunze ripped off a 4.45-second 40-yard dash and Nabers leaped 42 inches in the vertical jump, other dreams formed in the projection of these young adults, and some have wondered: Is Harrison more of a floor and these two are more of a ceiling?\n\nI think it's a ludicrous conversation, and I have a feeling the Colts agree with me. Owner Jim Irsay had a conversation for more than an hour with Harrison last season about his son, a year ahead of when he'd become draft eligible.\n\nI asked Reggie Wayne once about how Harrison compares to his Hall-of-Fame dad.\n\n\"He's bigger than Marvin,\" Wayne said. \"He's tall. He's faster than Marv.\"\n\nAnd he is. The younger Harrison measured in at the combine at 6-foot-3 and 209 pounds, or three inches and 24 pounds bigger than his father is listed on ProFootballReference.com. His father, of course, more than overcame average size to lead the NFL in receiving twice and become one of the top five receivers of all-time, but that is who has been advising the younger Harrison's every step in this unique pre-draft process.\n\nHis training, along with that of Ohio State star receivers coach Brian Hartline, is also apparent in the younger Harrison's film. Though Harrison is most known for his catch radius and ball skills along the sidelines, he's equally impressive as a route runner for the way his lower body operates more like a slot receiver than someone with his measurables.\n\nHarrison was electric last season, finishing fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting with his second straight season of 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns, despite sitting out the bowl game. But what was most impressive was how much of Ohio State's offense fell on his gangly shoulders. C.J. Stroud's departure left the Buckeyes to start Kyle McCord, who had chemistry with Harrison as his former high school quarterback but offered no college experience and pedestrian overall play, with just 10 touchdowns to players not named Harrison. He transferred to Syracuse after a loss to Michigan.\n\nI don't think the Colts will waffle on the type of player Harrison is. For this dream to have any chance, of course, they would need the Cardinals to do that waffling. And if they're torn between Harrison and Nabers at No. 4 and also love Odunze and possibly LSU's Brian Thomas Jr. and others, a trade back can make sense, which could be why they've been leaking their interest in doing so. Perhaps a move back 11 spots is too far, but they'd still have 10 picks to work with to move back up, a juggling act they pulled off time and again in general manager Monti Ossenfort's first draft a year ago.\n\nThe possibility of moving up for Harrison is at least a thought that has crossed Ballard's mind.\n\n\"Sure there is, when I go into fantasyland,\" Ballard said on the Rich Eisen Show when asked about the possibility. \"... That's not exactly been my nature to move up and give up what it would take to get that high. He's a really good player and I don't want to downgrade that, but it would be very difficult for us to get up that high.\"\n\nThat's what this is. It's fantasyland. The only way it could happen is if the Cardinals are hell-bent on trading down but don't have a suitor trading up for McCarthy, and if the price fell to a point where the pick-obsessed Ballard would do it, which might mean getting another one back.\n\nBallard has made the occasional over-the-top swing on one player before, though it's always been veterans. He traded first-round picks for DeForest Buckner and Carson Wentz, and he went hard after Danielle Hunter this spring before the four-time Pro Bowl edge rusher signed with his hometown Texans. His recourse to losing on Hunter was to not spend on any other starters in free agency. That's because his gambles are player-specific. It has to be for the perfect one in his eyes.\n\nThe depth of this year's receivers class is a strong argument against why the Colts would pay much to move up for a single one, but they're also not in the territory for the top tier of them. They don't see their offense as needing very many pieces to grow organically through Richardson and Shane Steichen, but they have repeatedly said they want to add a pass catcher and one with explosive, yards-after-the-catch traits. They just signed Michael Pittman Jr. to a three-year, $70 million extension, so any other swings among pass catchers are likely to happen in the draft with cost-controlled assets. In this fantasyland scenario, Harrison could finish out his rookie deal in time to replace Pittman as the high-dollar investment at the position.\n\nIt's all fantasy. It's all incredibly unlikely. But it's a dream on one player who is the perfect fit, and one that perhaps Ballard could be talked into. After all, he was asked about whether Harrison gave a template for other draft prospects to skip the combine in order to do it their way:\n\n\"Not everybody is Marvin Harrison.\"", "source": {"uri":

That they were a Quinyon Mitchell team. So I had already turned in my mock draft so I did not have that, but that's some of the intel that came in this (Tuesday) evening.\"\n\nIf Mitchell were to make it to pick 15, the Colts selecting him would be a no-brainer decision. However, as this pre-draft process has continued to unfold and Mitchell's stock continues to rise, the big question going into Round 1 is whether he would make it that far.\n\nAccording to ESPN analytics, there is only about a 30 percent chance that Mitchell falls to pick 15. The sweet spot, so to speak, when he has the highest chance to come off the board is in the 11 to 13 range.\n\nUsing the Rich Hill trade value chart as our guide, if the Colts were to move up to pick 11, for example, they may have to part with their third-round pick. If the Colts moved up to pick 13, they could have to trade away their fourth-round selection.\n\n\"I think it would depend,\" said Ballard about trading up when meeting with reporters last week. \"There would have to be someone within striking distance we felt was really unique and a difference-maker for us.\"\n\nCornerback needs to be a top priority for the Colts early in this draft. The Colts relied heavily on rookies in 2023, and with that, experienced very up and down play from this position group. Overall, the Colts' secondary surrendered way too many explosive plays and didn't have enough on-ball production.\n\nAt his pre-draft press conference, GM Chris Ballard was optimistic about improved play from this unit in 2024, saying that Jaylon Jones and JuJu Brents were no longer rookies and that getting Dallis Flowers back would be important.\n\nHowever, with that said, banking on that happening comes with obvious risks.\n\nThe addition of Mitchell to this group would provide an immediate upgrade. He has good size and terrific athleticism. Mitchell can handle both man and zone coverage schemes; he brings physicality to the position and has had excellent ball production at Toledo.", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colts Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bretl@coltswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Paul Bretl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jeremiah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jeremiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hill_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Hill (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallis_Flowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallis Flowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylon_Jones_(American_football,_born_2002)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylon Jones (American football, born 2002)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ballard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Ballard (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://coltswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/04/USATSI_22017794.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Other teams doing the same are Jacksonville, the Los Angeles Rams, and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nHere is what Graziano had to say:\n\n\"For the Colts and Jaguars, the target would most likely be a cornerback, which might be interesting to a team like Chicago at No. 9 or Denver at No. 12.

Conversely, finding the prospects who don't fit is just as important.\n\nThe Colts likely have their big board wrapped up with just over 24 hours to go until the draft so it's time to take a look at which prospects they should avoid in the first round.\n\nSN's NFL DRAFT HQ\n\nLive picks tracker | 7-round mock draft | Top 250 big board\n\nWhile the Colts need to add a cornerback early in the draft, it would be a bit surprising if Wiggins was near the top of their board. There's certainly upside with his game considering his speed and ball skills, but he doesn't fit what the Colts are looking for in an outside cornerback.\n\nMeasuring in at 6-foot-1 and 173 pounds with 30.5-inch arms, Wiggins' physical profile is one the Colts haven't targeted early in the draft. They usually go after the bigger-bodied cornerbacks with length. Because of his slight frame, there are concerns with his ability to be a consistent run defender, which is something the Colts need from their cornerbacks.\n\nThe hype has cooled somewhat on Coleman being a potential first-round pick, but there's always a chance he finds his way back up there. There's no doubt the Colts need to add to the wide receiver room, but Coleman's profile isn't one that matches up well with what Indy needs.\n\nMORE: 5 realistic targets for Colts in first round of NFL draft\n\nA contested-catch receiver, Coleman isn't going to win with separation. He thrives in those contested-catch situations, showing off impressive ball skills and body control. Winning that way in college is one thing, but it's an entirely different animal in the NFL. If the Colts considered him in the second round, it would make more sense. But the first round is far too rich for his profile.\n\nThis really goes for any of the offensive tackles. The Colts are set at offensive tackle with Bernhard Raimann and Braden Smith holding down the edges. Mims is intriguing from the perspective of untapped potential and a larger-than-life frame.\n\nMims is a complete project after starting just eight games throughout his college career.

Mitchell gives the Colts the perfect combination of physical traits (his long physique) and speed (4.33 seconds in the 40-yard dash) they seek in cornerbacks. After finishing last season 21st in explosive passing plays allowed, Indy's secondary gets more depth.\n\nGeneral manager Chris Ballard is all about drafting talented prospects with prototypical traits and athleticism. Mitchell is the freakiest cover corner in the draft, with a dynamic game that matches his supreme gifts.\n\nStaying at this spot and landing a top-10 prospect on the PFF big board in DeJean is a fantastic result for the Colts. He tested well at his pro day, and while his 2023 season wasn't as good as his 2022 season, he still earned a 77.0-plus grade in each of the past two seasons. He can also move around the defensive backfield, impressing both in coverage and against the run.\n\nHe's got size (6-0, 195), blazing speed (4.33 40 time) and ball skills, two of his six interceptions over the past two seasons turned into pick-sixes. And Indy needs cover help outside, particularly in a division where enemy QBs C.J. Stroud and Trevor Lawrence are bound to put the ball in the air frequently.\n\nTurner's fall stops! The Colts could use another quality rusher up front and Turner would find himself in a great spot by being able to play with a star defensive lineman like DeForest Buckner. It's hard to find 21-year-old edge rushers in the draft who also run a 4.47.

Here are players to watch", "body": "The 2024 NFL draft has arrived. Unlike last year, when the Colts held the No. 4 pick and the only question left was which quarterback Indianapolis would take, there is a lot more intrigue surrounding the Colts' selection on Thursday.\n\nWith plenty of rumors swirling that general manager Chris Ballard might buck his history and trade up, it's important to remember that Indianapolis has 19 to 21 players with first-round grades on its board, prefers to accumulate as many picks as possible by trading back and has a history of letting the board come to Ballard, for better or worse.\n\nNFL Draft best available players Round 1\n\nIndianapolis holds the No. 15 pick, has clear positional needs and enough young, developmental talent that the Colts could choose to swing for the fences by picking a player who could be a star at a position the franchise already has answers.\n\nRome Odunze, WR, Washington\n\nBallard told \"The Rich Eisen Show\" that trading up for Marvin Harrison Jr. is \"fantasyland,\" and the idea of Odunze dropping into arm's reach of the Colts is more of a dream than a reality. Odunze will almost certainly be long gone, but the Washington product is everything Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen could want in a wide receiver. Odunze is a big, fast, freakishly athletic target who can both beat teams deep and handle a high volume of throws, and on top of that, Odunze is a team captain who fits everything the Colts want in the locker room.\n\nDallas Turner, DE, Alabama\n\nIndianapolis likes the deep rotation it has built on the defensive line, but the Colts are still trying to find a true superstar off the edge. Turner, a 6-3, 256-pounder with incredibly long arms who also runs the 40-yard dash faster than most running backs, appears to be the only pass rusher in this draft who matches Ballard's preferences, and although he's unlikely to fall to No. 15, Turner would be a dream selection for a team that pursued Danielle Hunter in free agency.\n\nBrock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nThe Colts want a playmaker with the ability to produce yards after the catch, and even though Indianapolis already has a roster with plenty of young, developing tight ends, Bowers is a different kind of prospect, a potential future star with the playmaking ability to transform Steichen's offense.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\n\nFrom the outside, Mitchell looks like a perfect Ballard cornerback. Mitchell has size (6-foot, 195 pounds), speed (4.33 seconds in the 40-yard dash, ball production (six interceptions, 43 pass breakups over the last two seasons) and proved he belonged with the big boys at the Senior Bowl. Plus he plays one of the positions the Colts need most.\n\nTerrion Arnold, CB, Alabama\n\nArnold does not quite have Mitchell's speed, but he has the versatility to play outside and inside, picked off five passes in 2023 and has a reputation as a smart, well-coached player who will be ready to play right away.\n\nBrian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\n\nThomas is a deep threat, a 6-2 receiver who ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds and plays well as a deep threat down the field, making him a perfect fit for a Steichen offense focused on creating explosive plays down the field.\n\nCooper DeJean, CB, Iowa\n\nDeJean may not be in play at No. 15, but Ballard has been known to trade down in the first round. DeJean, a physical player with impressive athleticism, good ball skills and the versatility to play three different positions, although he'd likely project as an outside cornerback for a Colts team that already has Kenny Moore II in the slot. He's also a great tackler, a must for a Ballard cornerback.\n\nXavier Worthy, WR, Texas\n\nWorthy, like DeJean, is probably a trade-down candidate, considering he weighs just 165 pounds. What Worthy offers is extreme speed; Worthy ran the 40-yard dash in 4.21 seconds at the NFL scouting combine, and he was productive all three seasons at Texas, making more than 60 catches in all three seasons in Austin.\n\nColts NFL Draft needs\n\nFrom a positional numbers standpoint, the Colts are thin at wide receiver and cornerback beyond the starting lineup, but it's fair to say that what Indianapolis needs in this draft are players who can put this team over the top, either by adding explosive plays to the offense or by upgrading a pass defense that struggled at times last season.",

Along with every draft, there are mocks, predictions, and forecastings from the experts. In a recent article from Jordan Reid and Matt Miller of ESPN, the duo takes a unique perspective by debating each team's biggest need (Reid) versus the best value (Miller). In their entry for the Colts, there are selections of logic and lunacy.\n\nThe Colts spent three draft picks at cornerback last year -- JuJu Brents, Darius Rush (waived) and Jaylon Jones -- but none of them show the upside of Arnold. After a five-interception final college season, he's an effortless mover who can play either in the slot or on the perimeter early in his career.\n\nMurphy, ranked No. 13 on my board, would slide into an ideal spot with the Colts where he can rock next to DeForest Buckner. I see great first-step quickness, and he can be a three-down player.\n\nWhat happens next for the Colts? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our free newsletter and get breaking Colts news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nFor Reid's pick of Terrion Arnold, this makes perfect sense for what Indianapolis needs. Outside of wide receiver, cornerback is the next largest hole to add talent to on the Colts' roster. Recently re-signed veteran corner Kenny Moore II can use Arnold's day-one starting potential immediately. Also, JuJu Brents will accompany Arnold as one of the outside defensive backs and might develop quicker with a player like Arnold on the defense.\n\nHowever, it's Miller's value pick that is a head-scratcher. To say that a defensive tackle, albeit a fantastic one, is even on Indy's radar in the first round of the draft is madness. Defensive tackle Grover Stewart recently re-signed for three years, and newly acquired interior defender Raekwon Davis will be the rotational piece with Stewart and DeForest Buckner. Indy even kept Taven Bryan for another season on a one-year deal, adding even more competition to a position that is led by Stewart and Buckner. Indy simply isn't going to select Byron Murphy II with so many other needs on the roster. There's a better chance of the Colts trading back into the later part of the first round than selecting Murphy, even if he's the best available player at the 15th spot.\n\nThe Colts draft for 2024 is going to be an important one. With roster spots that need help like wide receiver, cornerback, safety, and line depth, where will Indianapolis focus their attention? Will there be a blockbuster trade up or back?

One thing that's for sure is there are clear needs in Indianapolis: cornerbacks and wide receivers.\n\nThere's been tons of talk about the Colts moving up to select a new pass catcher for QB Anthony Richardson, but no trades have been made just yet.

Beefing up the interior line may be the last thing Indianapolis needs, but passing up on a man of Murphy's talent could be difficult.\n\nComing off a dominant senior year, Byron Murphy II has tons of upside after recording five sacks with eight tackles for loss in the 2023 season. Murphy is one of the best disruptors in the draft and let his presence be known over and over again at Texas.\n\nRealistically, Murphy is likely to be off the board at 15. The lineman is picking up steam to be the first defensive player selected in the draft, currently sitting at +170 to be the first defender off the board (odds via DraftKings). A few teams have needs at defensive tackle, so Indianapolis may not get the chance to take the Longhorn.\n\nNothing has leaked out of the Colts' draft room, so the team could take a number of directions once they're on the clock.

Dan Graziano of ESPN mentioned something similar, saying that the Colts were making calls about potentially trading up for a top cornerback.\n\n\"I think it would depend,\" said Chris Ballard about trading up during his pre-draft press conference. \"There would have to be someone within striking distance we felt was really unique and a difference-maker for us.\"\n\nPerhaps this is something or it very well could be nothing. But let's pretend that this is how the first round unfolds. What would the Colts have to give up in order to make that trade, and how would the rest of the draft unfold?\n\nUsing PFF's mock draft simulator, I put together a mock draft that featured the Colts trading up for Mitchell. Here is how it all unfolded.\n\n1.12: Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\n\nMar 1, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Toledo defensive back Quinyon Mitchell (DB27) works out during the 2024 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTRADE: At pick 12, Mitchell was still on the board, and in Graziano's report, he mentioned that Denver could be a team looking to move back. In order to put together a fair trade package for both teams, I used the Rich Hill trade value chart as my guide. To pull this trade off, the Colts had to part with picks 15, 117, and 191 in return for pick 12.\n\nBreakdown: It's easy to see why Mitchell is on the Colts' radar. He would be an instant upgrade for a position group that very much needs it after struggling to make plays on the ball last season, along with giving up too many big pass plays as well. Mitchell can handle man or zone duties, he's physical in the run game, and had terrific ball production at Toledo.\n\n2.46: Xavier Legette, WR, South Carolina\n\nNov 25, 2023; Columbia, South Carolina, USA; South Carolina Gamecocks wide receiver Xavier Legette (17) runs the ball against Clemson Tigers safety Khalil Barnes (36) at Williams-Brice Stadium. Mandatory Credit: David Yeazell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBreakdown: Legette has excellent size at 6-1 - 221 pounds and the athleticism to match, posting a RAS of 9.92. He was a late-bloomer, not breaking out until 2023, his fifth-college season, where he averaged 17.7 yards per catch with 17 scores. Early on, as Legette develops, he may need more designed touches drawn up for him as he refines his route-running, but he is very good after the catch and could bring some needed YAC ability to the offense.\n\n3.82 Jalyx Hunt, Edge, Houston Christian\n\nJan 31, 2024; Mobile, AL, USA; American edge Jalyx Hunt of Houston Christian (13) works through a defensive drill during practice for the American team at Hancock Whitney Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBreakdown: The Colts need more consistency from their pass rush in 2024, and looking ahead to 2025, Dayo Odeyingbo and Kwity Paye are both set to be free agents if the Colts don't pick up Paye's fifth-year option. Hunt has the length and athleticism the Colts look for at edge rusher. Hunt ranked ninth among FCS edge rushers in 2023 in pass rush win rate. Over the last two years, he's totaled 81 pressures and 15 sacks.\n\n5.151: Beaux Limmer, IOL, Arkansas\n\nJan 30, 2024; Mobile, AL, USA; American offensive lineman Beaux Limmer of Arkansas (55) drills with American offensive lineman Charles Turner III of LSU (69) during practice for the American team at Hancock Whitney Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBreakdown: A good athlete and a very experienced lineman with almost 3,000 career snaps-most of which came at right guard, but Limmer played center during his final season at Arkansas. He allowed just three pressures and 12 sacks last season, and graded out well by PFF's run-blocking metrics. Next offseason, both Ryan Kelly and Will Fries are free agents.\n\n7.234: Mark Perry, S, TCU\n\n(Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\n\nBreakdown: The Colts reportedly had Perry in for a pre-draft visit. Perry has played 2,657 career snaps, with 838 coming in the box, 1,207 as a free safety, 540 from the slot, and has decent special teams experience. At 6-0 - 211 pounds with a RAS of 9.59, this is a late-round swing on Perry's upside.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nFeb 28, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Indianapolis Colts general manager Chris Ballard talks to the media at the 2024 NFL Combine at Indiana Convention Center. Mandatory Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBy trading up, the Colts get their upgrade at the cornerback position. However, the cost of doing so was going from seven draft picks, which already wasn't that many, relatively speaking, down to five. Going through his mock draft, that initial trade made addressing other needs much more challenging. I would have liked to address safety sooner to find some more immediate help, but I didn't have the opportunity to with how the board fell. Linebacker is another position I would have liked to add to but didn't get the chance. Perhaps if Ballard does actually trade up in Round 1, he would look to move down in Rounds 2 or 3 to get some draft capital back.", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

We have a solid history of what general manager Chris Ballard is looking for, but draft weekend is always full of surprises.\n\nFor this final iteration, we won't be using any mock draft simulators. Just good old-fashioned predictions.\n\nSN's NFL DRAFT HQ\n\nLive picks tracker | 7-round mock draft | Top 250 big board\n\nWithout further ado, here's our final predictions for the Colts:\n\nThere has been a lot of chatter about the Colts potentially moving up in the draft, but it's more likely they trade back and add more picks. In this deal with the Rams, the Colts move back four spots and add the No. 83 overall pick in the third round. From there, they take an explosive playmaker in Brian Thomas Jr. who fits perfectly in Shane Steichen's offense.\n\nWe have seen the Colts target the cornerback position in the second round a few times throughout Ballard's tenure. Melton is an elite athlete with incredible length, speed and explosiveness. He has a lot of experience working in press coverage, was a two-time team captain and went to the Senior Bowl.\n\nHunt spent three seasons at Cornell before transferring to Houston Christian where he was a two-year starter. He's an elite athlete with impeccable length working from the LEO position. There's a road of development ahead in terms of developing pass-rush counters and refining technique, but there's a lot of upside to him working behind Samson Ebukam.\n\nSome may feel this is a bit rich, and the Colts don't have a pressing need on the offensive line. However, Ryan Kelly is going into the final season of his current contract and will be 31 years old next offseason. Bortolini has rare movement skills and high intelligence with the versatility to work at all three interior spots. But the Colts can mold him into Kelly's successor with him serving a redshirt year.\n\nDoubling down on the Badgers, there's a good chance Allen sneaks into Day 3. He's the youngest player in this draft and is built like an actual tank. Pairing him with fellow Wisconsin alum Jonathan Taylor would give the Colts a lethal backfield duo to work alongside Anthony Richardson in the run game.\n\nUlofoshio's profile screams a Chris Ballard selection. At 6-foot and 236 pounds, the Washington product has 32 7/8-inch arms, and he ran a 4.56 in the 40-yard dash while posting a 39.5-inch vertical and 10-foot-8-inch broad jump. He was a team captain and Senior Bowl participant. With Zaire Franklin and E.J. Speed entrenched at linebacker, Ulofoshio can serve on special teams during his rookie season.\n\nA sixth-year senior, Grable will turn 25 years old halfway through his rookie season. Even so, he's an intriguing Day 3 addition for the Colts, who need to add some depth at offensive tackle. At 6-foot-5 and 306 pounds, Grable has impressive movement skills. He posted a 4.95 in the 40-yard dash and a 36.5-inch vertical. He walked on at Jacksonville State and then transitioned from tight end to offensive line so he's still developing his game, but he has the profile to take a chance on late during Day 3.\n\nWatts may have spent his collegiate career working at cornerback, but he's likely to switch to the safety position in the NFL. He's an elite athlete at 6-foot-2 and 208 pounds. He started his career at Ohio State before transferring to Texas for his final two seasons. He has 34.5-inch arms, ran a 4.53 in the 40-yard dash and posted a 40.5-inch vertical jump. He's a freak athlete who can contribute on special teams while he further develops his game as a safety.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"},

Mitchell is the freakiest cover corner in the draft, with a dynamic game that matches his supreme gifts.\"\n\nColts Wire's breakdown: Mitchell has been a very popular pick for the Colts at 15th overall, and it's easy to see why. He's a tremendous athlete, which GM Chris Ballard has emphasized heavily in the last two drafts. Mitchell has the ability to play both man and zone, along with bringing a level of physicality in the run game from the cornerback position. He's also had excellent ball production, with six interceptions and 27 pass breakups in the last two seasons.\n\nPositional need: Addressing cornerback is either 1A or 1B on the Colts' to-do list in this draft. This was a young position group last season that, as should have been expected, battled consistency issues. Overall, explosive pass plays happened far too often, along with the Colts ranking 22nd in both pass breakups and yards per pass attempt allowed. Ballard recently said that getting Dallis Flowers back will be important, and young players like Jaylon Jones are no longer rookies, so improvement is expected. However, there are obvious risks that come with banking on that happening.\n\nWhat Lance Zierlein of NFL.com had to say: \"Mitchell possesses a gumbo of traits, with size, strength and speed filling up the pot. He's built like a running back, tackles like a safety and has the ball skills of a cornerback. Mitchell can play in a variety of coverages and was the clear-cut top cornerback at the Senior Bowl when working against the top receivers in practice. While he needs to trace a more efficient path when hounding the route, his burst to close and physicality at the catch point could create tougher throwing windows for quarterbacks. Mitchell's traits, play demeanor and special-teams potential should make him attractive to teams in the market for CB help.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ballard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Ballard (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Zierlein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Zierlein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hEI2gONzwudW.UCgPEEdVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/indianapolis_colts_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_945/504027df3ef4e2d97b18ce91b51c91f7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Despite handing star wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. a lofty contract earlier this offseason, Indianapolis needs to provide young quarterback Anthony Richardson more weapons in the passing game.\n\nThe Colts have primarily been linked to Rome Odunze of the Washington Huskies. In fact, our final mock before the draft has Indianapolis moving up to the eighth spot with the Atlanta Falcons for the star wide receiver.\n\n\"The Indianapolis Colts have two clear needs at wide receiver and cornerback, but the talent level at this position is much higher than the latter. While general manager Chris Ballard would have to forfeit some significant draft capital in this trade, he'd be providing quarterback Anthony Richardson with a wide receiver who is eerily similar to Keenan Allen and Davante Adams.\"\n\nWhile eight seems to be conventional widsom as it relates to trade-up scenarios, there is another possibility at play here. Leave it to Colts owner Jim Irsay to create speculation out of thin air.\n\nRelated: Full 7-round Indianapolis Colts mock draft\n\nIn talking to Mike Chappell of Fox 59, Irsay said it is likely \"too difficult\" to trade far enough up for the former Ohio State standout. But he also provided a somewhat interesting caveat.\n\n\"I wouldn't rule anything out,\" Irsay said. \"We're open-minded.\"\n\nOutside of an on-field fit, the connections are obvious. Harrison's father played for the Colts from 1996-2008. He earned eight Pro Bowl appearance with the team, is the franchise's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. He's also a Pro Football Hall of Famer.\n\nWith all of that said, this is a potential logistical nightmare for Indianapolis. The top-three picks in the NFL Draft are expected to be quarterbacks. Caleb Williams will go No. 1 to the Chicago Bears. Jayden Daniels is the likely pick of the Washington Commanders at two. Meanwhile, the New England Patriots will either select a quarterback or trade down with a team that will pick one.\n\nThis puts the Arizona Cardinals in play at four as a potential trade-down partner. They are said to be open for business.\n\nThe question here is cost. A trade up from 15 to four would likely cost the Colts multiple future first-round picks. Are they willing to bank on a generational talent like Harrison Jr. to follow in his father's footsteps. It's a real question.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_frank@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Vincent Frank", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Richardson_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Richardson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pittman_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Pittman Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Irsay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Irsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davante_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davante Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jim-irsay-21871466.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Nabers would, of course, be an excellent addition and bring that needed juice to the Colts offense. He can win in a variety of ways and do so at all levels of the field. With that said, I'm still skeptical that we see Chris Ballard trade up. Recently, I detailed why the Colts would actually trade down.\n\nDallas Turner, Edge, Alabama\n\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock: Charles Robinson and Nate Tice - Yahoo! Sports\n\nPick: Dallas Turner, Edge, Alabama\n\nBreakdown: Turner is considered by many to be a top-10 pick, so we really haven't seen him available to the Colts at pick 15. After ranking 23rd in pressures last season, the Colts will need to generate more consistent pressure this year if they hope to replicate their sack production. Turner brings size and speed to the position, totaling 55 pressures and 11 sacks in 2023.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\n\nMar 1, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Toledo defensive back Quinyon Mitchell (DB27) works out during the 2024 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock: Ari Meirov - 33rd Team\n\nPick: Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\n\nBreakdown: For what it's worth, Meirov mentioned in his mock that these predictions are based on what individuals around the NFL believe will happen. If available at pick 15, Mitchell makes all the sense in the world for the Colts. He's an elite athlete, can play man or zone, is physical, and has had excellent ball production-which the Colts need more of.\n\nTRADE: Graham Barton, IOL, Duke\n\nNov 11, 2023; Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA; Duke Blue Devils offensive lineman Graham Barton (62) before the game at Kenan Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock: RJ White - CBS Sports\n\nTRADE: The Colts move down to pick 25 in a trade with the Packers. In return for the 15th overall pick, the Colts get picks 25 and 58, giving them two second-round picks.\n\nBreakdown: Barton has the ability to play all five positions, which is incredibly valuable. He feels like one of those rare high-floor, high-ceiling prospects. Finding a spot for him on the 2024 offensive line could be tricky, but as White notes in his mock draft, this move is about the future, with Ryan Kelly and Will Fries set to be free agents in 2025. Perhaps with an extra second-round pick, Ballard would feel that he has more flexibility to address a lesser need.\n\nBrian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\n\n17. Jacksonville Jaguars - Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\n\nMock: Ben Solak - The Ringer\n\nPick: Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\n\nBreakdown: Thomas is just an excellent fit for the Colts offense and what they want to do under Shane Steichen, pushing the ball downfield. Thomas averaged over 17 yards per catch in 2023, and when a team has a vertical presence, that player opens up opportunities for his teammates over the middle and underneath with his gravity.\n\nTRADE: Payton Wilson, LB, NC State\n\nOct 28, 2023; Raleigh, North Carolina, USA; North Carolina State Wolfpack linebacker Payton Wilson (11) celebrates after scoring a touchdown on an interception during the second half against the Clemson Tigers at Carter-Finley Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rob Kinnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock: PFF\n\nTRADE: The Colts move down to pick 29 and acquire from the Lions picks 29, 61, and a 2025 third-round pick, along with also giving up pick 117 in addition to pick 15.\n\nBreakdown: Talk about going off-script. A linebacker in the first round? I will say, linebacker could be veiwed as a sneaky need with a bunch of question marks behind EJ Speed and Zaire Franklin, along with Speed being a free agent in 2025, but in the first round? Wilson is a very good athlete and is at his best in coverage.\n\nBrock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nJoshua L. Jones/USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMock: Eric Edholm - NFL.com\n\nPick: Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nBreakdown: If Bowers gets to pick 15, I'm not sure Ballard would be able to pass on selecting him. According to ESPN analytics, those odds of Bowers getting to that point are relatively low. Bowers would immediately provide Anthony Richardson with another reliable target and was excellent at picking up yards after the catch. A move tight end with Bowers' abilities could help further open up the playbook for Shane Steichen.\n\nTerrion Arnold, CB, Alabama\n\nJan 1, 2024; Pasadena, CA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide defensive back Terrion Arnold (3) celebrates after an incomplete pass during the first half against the Michigan Wolverines in the 2024 Rose Bowl college football playoff semifinal game at Rose Bowl. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock: Jeff Risdon - Draft Wire\n\nPick: Terrion Arnold, CB, Alabama\n\nBreakdown: As I was going through these mock drafts, I began thinking, where is Terrion Arnold? ESPN analytics has him as the most likely player to be selected at 15th overall. Arnold held opponents to a completion rate of just over 50 percent and under 11.0 yards per catch with very good ball production.\n\nMore mock drafts\n\nDec 2, 2023; Detroit, MI, USA; Toledo Rockets cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (27) breaks up a pass intended for Miami (OH) Redhawks wide receiver Gage Larvadain (10) in the third quarter at Ford Field.

At pick 15, Brinson had the Colts selecting JC Latham from Alabama.\n\nHere is what Brinson had to say about the pick:\n\n\"Hey buddy that offensive line is getting older in Indy.\"\n\nIn an extremely deep offensive tackle class, Latham is among the best. At right tackle for Alabama last season, he surrendered just two sacks and 14 pressures while also being one of PFF's highest-graded run defenders.\n\nThe Colts, of course, have much more pressing needs than at tackle at cornerback, receiver, and edge rusher.\n\nTackle is a position group that the Colts have invested in during recent drafts, selecting Bernhard Raimann, Blake Freeland, and Jake Witt. They also have Braden Smith returning this season as well.\n\nThe Colts' offensive line was one of the better units in football last season, ranking 11th in run-block win rate and sixth in pass-blocking efficiency-and they return their entire starting five.\n\nBut as we take a look ahead to 2025, there are some potential unknowns at one of the game's most important positions. Smith will be entering the final year of his deal and comes with a cap hit of almost $20 million. The Colts still don't know what they have in Freeland, who took his lumps as a rookie when called upon.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean they are going to spend a first-round pick on the position, either. As already mentioned, this is a group that's in good shape and it's a very strong position group in this year's class, with GM Chris Ballard believing that very good players can be found in the middle and even latter portions of the draft.\n\n\"I think there's a few positions that's got some real depth,\" said Ballard Friday at his pre-draft press conference. \"Like the O-line in this draft is excellent and there's depth throughout. I truly believe you're going to get a really good player in those mid-rounds and even some later because of the depth of the group.\"\n\nWith only four true offensive tackles currently on the roster, this will be a position group that the Colts have to add to, even if it's just purely for depth, as they'll need more bodies to get through training camp and the preseason.", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colts Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bretl@coltswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Paul Bretl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Witt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Witt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Freeland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Freeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Raimann", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernhard Raimann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braden_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Braden Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://coltswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/04/USATSI_16851104.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Cornerback is an obvious need, and you have to wonder if the depth of the offensive line class, especially at tackle, could be too good for GM Chris Ballard to pass on.\n\nThe safety class, meanwhile, is considered one of the weaker position groups in this year's draft, while edge rusher isn't as strong overall as it usually is.\n\nThe Colts currently hold three picks within the top 100-one in each round. Here is a look at Jeremiah's top 100 prospects in this year's class at key positions for the Colts.\n\nCornerback\n\nSep 23, 2023; Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide defensive back Terrion Arnold (3) carries the ball after an interception against the Mississippi Rebels during the second half of a football game at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Butch Dill-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNeed: Too many big plays were given up last season, and not enough plays were made on the ball. The Colts ranked 22nd in both yards per attempt surrendered and pass breakups in 2023. Kenny Moore will handle the nickel duties, and JuJu Brents will be one of the outside cornerbacks, but the spot across from him is up for grabs. Ballard recently discussed the importance of getting Dallis Flowers back and that improved play is expected from players like Jaylon Jones, since he is no longer a rookie. However, this is a position that very much remains upgradeable.\n\n9. Terrion Arnold, Alabama\n\n12. Quinyon Mitchell, Toledo\n\n24. Cooper DeJean, Iowa\n\n28. Kool-Aid McKinstry, Alabama\n\n32.

Mandatory Credit: Matt Blewett-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNeed: Re-signing Julian Blackmon provides some needed stability, but it's a short-term fix, with him only returning on a one-year deal. As of now, either Rodney Thomas or Nick Cross will be the Colts' free safety this season. As already mentioned, big pass plays were an issue for the secondary last season. In this short term, the free safety role remains upgradeable, in the long-term, a failure to bring in new talent could leave the Colts in a similar spot next offseason when Blackmon is again a free agent.\n\n52.

Mandatory Credit: Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNeed: Chris Ballard hasn't been shy in saying that the Colts need more playmaking on offense after ranking 24th in explosive pass plays in 2023. Michael Pittman and Josh Downs create a high floor for this position group, but both averaged fewer than 12.0 yards per catch last season, not to mention that the overall depth can be improved on as well. A vertical presence, which perhaps Alec Pierce can provide, would go a long ways in Shane Steichen's system.\n\n17. Brian Thomas, LSU\n\n27. Adonai Mitchell, Texas\n\n30.

Beyond EJ Speed and Zaire Franklin on the depth chart is a lot of inexperience and unknowns. Looking ahead to next offseason, both Speed and Ronnie Harrison are set to be free agents. A linebacker who is best in coverage would provide a different skill set to this position group.\n\n29. Edgerrin Cooper, Texas A&M\n\n41. Payton Wilson, NC State\n\n43. Junior Colson, Michigan\n\n75.

Mandatory Credit: Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNeed: The Colts may have ranked fifth in sacks last season, but the underlying numbers tell us that won't be repeatable without more consistent pressure. Also last season, the Colts ranked 22nd in pressure rate and 23rd in total pressures, meaning that a very high number of those pressures turned to sacks, something that may not be sustainable long-term. On top of that, Kwity Paye and Dayo Odeyingbo are entering the final year of their current deals.\n\n13. Dallas Turner, Alabama\n\n14. Jared Verse, Florida State\n\n16. Laiatu Latu, UCLA\n\n21.

Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNeed: Similarly to linebacker, this isn't a pressing need, especailly for 2024, but the NFL Draft is about planning ahead, and if we take a peek at the 2025 offseason, both Ryan Kelly and Will Fries are set to be free agents. At his pre-draft press conference, Ballard discussed the depth of the offensive line class, mentioning the ability to get quality players in the middle portion of the draft and even potentially later than that. That may be the sweet spot for the Colts and where they look to add to this group.\n\n22. Graham Barton, Duke\n\n34. Jackson Powers-Johnson, Oregon\n\n37. Zach Frazier, West Virginia\n\n66. Dominick Puni, Kansas State\n\n77. Christian Haynes, UCONN\n\n80. Cooper Beebe, Kansas State\n\n99. Brandon Coleman, TCU\n\nTight End\n\nNeed: This isn't a pressing need but could be one that's on Ballard's radar on Day 3. Overall, the Colts need a greater impact in the passing game from this position group, which hopefully, a healthy Jelani Woods can help provide. But this is also Mo Alie-Cox's final year on his current deal, and whether it comes via an addition in the draft or someone on the roster continues to emerge, a blocking presence will be needed at tight end in 2024 if Cox is playing elsewhere.\n\n7.

But it's got to work out,\" Ballard said, per Smith. \"And then you've got to have too, you've got to have somebody that wants to make the trade.\"\n\nThe Taylor trade involved a much smaller leap than what moving up to draft Harrison would likely require. In the case of the 2020 draft, the Colts jumped just three spots from No. 44 to No. 41 to grab the running back.\n\nIn this case, the Colts would likely only find themselves within the \"striking distance\" described by Ballard if Harrison has an unlikely slide on draft night.\n\nThat's still a possibility that teams could draft Washington's Rome Odunze or LSU's Malik Nabers ahead of Harrison because they find one of the other top wideouts a better match for their offensive structure.\n\nThat could potentially allow Harrison to fall a spot or two, but anything beyond that would be a true surprise.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_stumbaugh@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Julia Stumbaugh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Irsay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Irsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout.com", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ballard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Ballard (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Nabers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malik Nabers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1713979777/sdioltauvpz9boksrz9r.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

There's always something interesting to look out for during a Chris Ballard-led draft. Whether a trade back, tension building by staying put, or grabbing diamonds in the rough during day three, Ballard never disappoints with working some magic during the draft process.\n\nWith so many positions needing skill and the future of the Anthony Richardson era on the line, it's time to give my 2024 Colts mock draft for all seven rounds. I used the 2024 Indy Draft Guide and the Jimmy Johnson Trade Value Chart to research the prospects and value of Indy's trades. Right from the start, Indy makes a deal that will turn heads.\n\nThe Colts seemed highly intrigued by Texas receiver Xavier Worthy. This was made more apparent after sending head coach Shane Steichen, offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter, and wide receivers coach Reggie Wayne to the Texas Pro Day. While Adonai Mitchell was there, too, Indy goes with Worthy here at 27th overall. They also acquire a third and fourth-rounder in the draft to add more talent while the Arizona Cardinals don't wait till the 27th selection to add more to their roster after grabbing a playmaker at number four.\n\nAfter nothing but consistency (60+ catches every year at Texas) and big-play capabilities displayed in college, Steichen gets his explosive weapon to put in the mix at receiver. He's also far more than the fastest receiver in NFL Combine history, as he excels in the short and deep passing game and can operate in the slot or on the outside as a massive threat to defenses.\n\nThere have been plenty of mock drafts where Indy picks a cornerback in the first round, but Rutgers cornerback Max Melton is a fantastic defender to acquire in the second. While he may be a bit under the radar, he's also a perfect fit for what Gus Bradley needs at cornerback.\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Melton finished with a 74.1 coverage grade and stuck himself into the run defense often. He has a smaller frame (5'11\") but possesses fantastic speed at corner, which Indy needs for the fast-developing offenses in the AFC South division. Melton concluded his career at Rutgers with 41 games, 111 tackles, 8 interceptions, and 22 passes defended.\n\nWhile Melton didn't play a lot of snaps at slot cornerback, that's not a reason to avoid him. He is an outside coverage specialist who can help fellow corners JuJu Brents and Kenny Moore II. There is also a chance he's a day-one starter if his potential hits its stride, making Melton a winning selection for the defense.\n\nNow that the Colts have two third-rounders, they will use the 66th overall selection to continue adding receivers. This time, it's Richardson's former Florida teammate, Ricky Pearsall. The former Gator is the perfect blend of versatility and reliability at pass-catcher for a developing quarterback like Richardson to have at his disposal. While it took a while for Pearsall to take off in college, he finished 2023 strong. He put a bow on his time in Florida with 65 catches for 965 yards (14.8 avg) and 6 total scores (2 rushing).\n\nPearsall isn't a massive receiver, but he has played both outside and slot, giving Steichen a lot of ways to use him. He also possesses great route-running fundamentals and hands, equipping him with the potential to flourish with a dynamic dual-threat field general like Richardson. If Indianapolis makes this selection, they will give Richardson a familiar face and a pass-catcher with the skills to add weaponry to the offense.\n\nAfter selecting the quick corner Melton in the second round, Indy still gets to snag an athletic and lengthy player for the secondary. Khyree Jackson from Oregon displayed why he could be a great addition to the Colts' defense in his time with the Ducks.\n\nAfter spending 2021 and 2022 with Alabama, Jackson transferred to Oregon and made an impact in 2023. Through 12 games, Jackson grabbed 34 tackles (5.0 for loss), 2.0 sacks, 3 interceptions, and 7 passes defended. Standing at an imposing 6'4\", he possesses the frame and tenacity to fit into Bradley's secondary in a beautiful fashion. He also plays his best on the outside, giving Indy the potential to move Dallis Flowers to the inside at slot, given his speed.\n\nJackson doesn't have elite speed, but the Colts addressed this with the Melton selection, and Jackson's strengths don't require it. They also have this on the roster with Flowers, giving Jackson an immediate role on the defense. Likely, he would compete with Jaylon Jones and Flowers for the CB4 spot on the depth chart. Look for Indy to have their eye on the lengthy and athletic defender around these rounds.\n\nIndianapolis finally gets their next free safety prospect in Georgia's Tykee Smith. Smith played five years in college but saved his best football for 2023. He showcased high football IQ, versatility, and efficiency across the board. Per PFF, Smith graded at 84.0 for overall defense, 85.8 for coverage, and 70.3 for tackling last year. These marks were acquired en route to 70 tackles (8.5 for loss), 2.0 sacks, 4 interceptions, and 2 passes defended.\n\nWhile Smith can improve his fluidity in coverage and tracking receivers, he provides solid depth, run support and potentially starting-caliber skills. It is also worth noting that Smith is a third-round prospect, so in this scenario, Indy gets him falling in the draft, which would be a high-level steal.\n\nWhat happens next for the Colts? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our free newsletter and get breaking Colts news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nWisconsin center/guard Tanor Bortolini makes perfect sense for Indianapolis and should be available around the #117 pick. Bortolini likely won't be a center. Instead, he'll likely be at right guard behind current starter Will Fries. While Fries had a nice 2023 season, he's also a free agent in 2025 and could see himself not retained with the other massive contracts already on the offensive line. Plus, right tackle Bernhard Raimann is showing franchise-level efficiency and will be the priority over Fries.\n\nBortolini finished 2023 with a pass-blocking grade of 80.3 and an overall mark of 65.9. Bortolini is a moldable ball of potential for the Indianapolis offensive line. With Fries' contract impending, Indy will take Bortolini with the hope that he can be the successor on a rookie contract while the more important linemen get paid. With Bortolini's ridiculous athleticism, there's a chance he could be a fine addition in the fourth round for a Colts team that can always use offensive line depth, at the least.\n\nIn this scenario, the Los Angeles Rams find a player that can fit their philosophy and don't want the prospect to pass them by in the fifth, so they're willing to let Indy take another sixth-rounder and the 155th overall selection. Washington linebacker and coverage specialist Edefuan Ulofoshio fits the bill for what Indy needs at the position.\n\nWhat sticks out the most for Ulofoshio is his incredible coverage skills as a linebacker. After posting 326 coverage snaps in 2023, he paired those with a blistering 90.4 cover grade, per PFF. While Indy has their starting linebackers in Zaire Franklin and E.J. Speed, neither are truly cover defenders.\n\nThat role could belong to Ulofoshio and Segun Olubi unless there is direct competition for the cover role. Ulofoshio isn't the most glamorous pick in the fifth round, but he can create turnovers and help the overall performance of the linebacking corps.\n\nLast season, the Colts had 51 sacks as a defense, good enough for fifth in the NFL. However, they still lacked consistent pressure on opposing quarterbacks. If Indianapolis wants to use a day-three pick to help shore up this issue, Texas Tech Red Raider Myles Cole is the perfect prospect in the draft.\n\nIn 2023, Cole led the Red Raiders with 27 pressures and 19 quarterback hurries (tied). He also threw in 32 tackles (6.5 for loss) and 3.5 sacks. Cole's ceiling with Indy is a Tyquan Lewis-type of role as a pressure specialist. But, with such an incredible 6'6\" frame and high-level athleticism, it would be interesting to see Cole's role on the defensive front with new coach Charlie Partridge.\n\nThe Colts allowed running back Zack Moss to explore free agency, leading him to sign with the Cincinnati Bengals during the offseason. While the Colts have Taylor, receiving specialist Evan Hull, and three-year veteran Trey Sermon, there's still a void in the backfield to fill.\n\nIndy will use the 217th pick they acquired from the Rams to select UCLA's Carson Steele. The former Ball State Cardinal and UCLA Bruins back has strong abilities as a short yardage ball-carrier, giving help to Taylor in those situations. Where he lacks is in the receiving department, but that is expected when selecting Steele.\n\nIn three years as a college back, he compiled 648 carries for 3,294 yards (5.1 avg.) and 26 rushing scores. He also added 58 catches for 486 yards and 4 more touchdowns, giving him 30 scores from scrimmage. Another note is that Steele excels in pass blocking, which multiple Colts runners, Jonathan Taylor included, have struggled with.\n\nA force of nature at safety, Wake Forest's Malik Mustapha is a brilliant way to end the draft for Indianapolis from an intensity standpoint. One of the premier run defenders for the 2023 Demon Deacons, Mustapha brings tenacity and aggression to Indy's defense that will look to smash ground attacks.\n\nHowever, Mustapha has areas to work on, mainly with coverage and tackling efficiency. Per PFF, Mustapha tied for the top spot for missed tackles (11), which isn't an encouraging statistic. But, with some fine-tuning and work with other NFL-level talent, perhaps Mustapha could become the super-athletic run defender Indy can use. He's also alluring this late in the draft due to how his abilities fit with Indy's special teams.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Last year, it was Brian Branch. And he worked out well for the Detroit Lions. This year? It's Terrion Arnold, who really had to work to becoming what he is now as perhaps the top corner in this year's draft.\"\n\nBrian Branch wasn't taken by the Detroit Lions until the 45th pick in last year's draft, despite being considered by many one of the top safety prospects.\n\nIn his rookie season, playing primarily from the slot, Branch allowed fewer than 10 yards per catch, totaled 11 pass breakups with three interceptions, and ranked seventh in run defense grade.\n\nIf the Colts were to select Arnold, they would be hoping for a similar impact early on.\n\nArnold had excellent ball production last season - something that this Colts secondary needs more of - recording five interceptions and 13 pass breakups. He held opponents to under 11.0 yards per catch, and opposing quarterbacks had a completion rate of only 52 percent.\n\nArnold was also one of PFF's highest-graded run defenders at cornerback, along with being a capable tackler.\n\nRelying heavily on several rookies in the secondary last season, the Colts experienced very up-and-down play, resulting in too many explosive plays surrendered and not enough plays on the football being made.\n\nRecently, GM Chris Ballard discussed that these young players are no longer rookies and that improvement is expected in 2024. However, there are obvious risks associated with banking on that happening, which is why cornerback is one of the bigger needs for this team.\n\nKenny Moore will be in the slot, and JuJu Brents on the boundary, but the spot across from him will be up for grabs, with Dallis Flowers and Jaylon Jones presumably as the front-runners-unless a player like Arnold is added to the mix.", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colts Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bretl@coltswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Paul Bretl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Branch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Branch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylon_Jones_(American_football,_born_2002)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylon Jones (American football, born 2002)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://coltswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/03/1813866450.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Erickson and Nate Atkins put together a different kind of mock draft, playing the role of the team's scouts and general manager Chris Ballard. ESPN's draft simulator makes the rest of the picks, and when the Colts come on the clock, Erickson and Atkins weigh the options, then make the team's first four picks based on who's available at the time.\n\nErickson: This Indianapolis draft is intriguing. A year ago, the Colts held the No. 4 pick, the position they were picking was obvious and the only intrigue was which name they would call. Indianapolis holds the No. 15 pick this season, has a lot of young, developmental talent at several positions and some flexibility with the first-round pick, although cornerback and wide receiver are the clear, obvious needs. Even so, the hope has to be that a glut of talent in the top 10 ends up pushing down a premier player to the Colts, who have 19 to 21 players on their board with a first-round grade. When the offseason opened, Indianapolis general manager Chris Ballard said the Colts need to get more explosive on offense and better at presenting explosive plays on defense. Those are the marching orders.\n\nFIRST ROUND: 1. Caleb Williams, QB, Bears; 2. Jayden Daniels, QB, Commanders; 3. Drake Maye, QB, Patriots; 4. Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Cardinals; 5. J.J. McCarthy, QB, Vikings; 6. Malik Nabers, WR, Giants; 7. Joe Alt, T, Titans; 8. Dallas Turner, DE, Falcons; 9. Brock Bowers, TE, Bears; 10. Rome Odunze, WR, Jets; 11. Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Chargers; 12. Terrion Arnold, CB, Broncos; 13. Taliese Fuaga, T, Raiders; 14. Olumuyiwa Fashanu, Saints.\n\nErickson: This is about as bad a scenario as it gets.\n\nAtkins: Nightmarish. The Colts miss out on both of the top cornerbacks and Brock Bowers and Dallas Turner. I think this simulation could make the case for a trade up, but we know what's more likely for this franchise is a trade back. But you can also argue that there's a one-man Tier 2 at the wide receiver position and that guy is available: LSU's Brian Thomas Jr.\n\nErickson: That is true. Thomas Jr. is plenty explosive. He stands 6-2, weighs 209 pounds, ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds and averaged 17.3 yards per catch in the SEC while scoring 17 touchdowns last year. There's a lot to like there, although he was reportedly flagged for medicals by a few teams due to a shoulder injury, according to Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer. Defensively, any interest in Florida State edge rusher Jared Verse or Iowa cornerback Cooper DeJean?\n\nAtkins: I like Jared Verse a good deal as a pure pass rusher with more tools and juice than what they currently have at either edge spot. He seems to have slipped in other mocks, so maybe he can be there with a trade down. Cooper DeJean feels like a good trade-down alternative to Quinyon Mitchell or Terrion Arnold but is a little rich of a pick at No. 15.\n\nErickson: A trade down feels like a distinct possibility in a situation like this. The \"cloud\" of players we were hoping to drop to 15 are all gone - Bowers, Turner, Mitchell, Arnold - and there is no obvious selection to me.\n\nAtkins: Let's trade down, because that's exactly what Ballard has on his mind most of the time. The Rams are sitting there at No. 19, suddenly with picks at their disposal. They need to replace Aaron Donald somehow, and Byron Murphy is on the board. So let's see if we can get one of their extra third-round picks to slide back four spots and see who is left.\n\nColts trade No. 15 pick to Rams for No. 19 pick, No. 83 pick\n\n15. Byron Murphy, DT, Rams; 16. Graham Barton, C/G, Seahawks; 17. Jared Verse, DE, Jaguars; 18. Brian Thomas Jr., WR, Bengals.\n\nErickson: This is a cautionary tale against trading down. The two players we were hoping would fall to us end up hearing their names called right before our new pick, leaving us scrambling a bit. Cincinnati taking Thomas Jr. is a surprise, but that's the thing - there will be surprises in the real draft on Thursday night.\n\nAtkins: That's the opportunity cost to loading up on draft picks. This isn't the best year for Day 2 selections either, though that's Ballard's wheelhouse and I feel like he'll find some way to put it to use.\n\nIn this scenario, Cooper DeJean feels like the pick. He's a phenom when it comes to Relative Athletic Score, which is a formula the Colts love to draft by that compares athletic testing for all prospects since 1987. DeJean is also from a major program and can help them inside and outside at cornerback, which is the weakest position on the team. Xavier Worthy is a little tempting, but I think it's too early to dip into that tier of pass catcher.\n\nErickson: DeJean is a playmaker. He had three pick-sixes and five interceptions overall in 2022, and the Colts have long been looking for a cornerback with ball skills; defensive backs coach Ron Milus made it a priority last season. Plus, DeJean's versatility gives the Colts a realistic option to move inside if Kenny Moore II is injured, a spot that has been lacking for years.\n\nThe pick: Cooper DeJean, CB, Iowa\n\n20. J.C. Latham, T, Steelers; 21. Troy Fautanu, T, Dolphins; 22. Laiatu Latu, DE, Eagles; 23. Adonai Mitchell, WR, Chargers; 24. Chop Robinson, DE, Cowboys; 25. Kool-Aid McKinstry, CB, Packers; 26. Amarius Mims, T, Buccaneers; 27. Tyler Guyton, T, Cardinals; 28. Xavier Worthy, WR, Bills.\n\nErickson: We tried to trade up to No. 25 to get Worthy, but the Packers wanted our second-rounder (No. 46), third-rounder (No. 82) and fourth-rounder (No. 117). We decided that was too rich for our blood, and three picks later, Buffalo takes Worthy. Letting the board come to us is very Colts-like, but it's not working for us at all.\n\nAtkins: Worthy was tempting because he answers the need for speed in the offense in the return game, but Ballard isn't one to trade three picks for one at this juncture. He's more likely to trust Shane Steichen to work with a variety of skill sets at receiver, so we'll just let the picks roll.\n\n29. Keon Coleman, WR, Lions; 30. Jordan Morgan, T, Ravens; 31. Nate Wiggins, CB, 49ers; 32. Jer'Zhan Newton, DT, Chiefs. SECOND ROUND 33. Jackson Powers-Johnson, C, Panthers; 34. Ladd McConkey, WR, Patriots; 35. Darius Robinson, DL, Cardinals; 36. Braden Fiske, DT, Commanders; 37. Edgerrin Cooper, LB, Chargers; 38. Roman Wilson, WR, Titans; 39. Junior Colson, LB, Panthers; 40. Michael Hall Jr., DT, Commanders; 41. Jaden Hicks, S, Packers; 42. Kris Jenkins, DT, Texans; 43. Ricky Pearsall, WR, Falcons; 44. Michael Penix Jr., QB, Raiders; 45. Kamari Lassiter, CB, Saints.\n\nErickson: Our first pick addressed the most uncertain position on the roster. Wide receiver remains a clear need. South Carolina's Xavier Legette, Oregon's Troy Franklin and Western Kentucky's Malachi Corley are available. If we want to make a move at safety, Georgia's Javon Bullard and Utah's Cole Bishop are there, and Ballard praised the readiness of Bulldogs defensive players.\n\nAtkins: I have a feeling with the lack of starpower at the top of the safety class, the Colts are more likely to give Nick Cross his chance at free safety than to draft something similar that high. I could be wrong, but I sense they want guys who no doubt have a role open to them with these early picks.\n\nErickson: Corley's nickname in college was \"YAC King,\" but he ran the 40 in 4.56 seconds-Ballard likes speed-and he played almost exclusively out of the slot, where Indianapolis already has Josh Downs. Legette's a polarizing prospect; the Gamecocks star had just one year of good production in five seasons, and there are concerns about his ability to create after the catch. The wide receiver class is deep, but Troy Franklin feels like a player that Steichen can use.\n\nAtkins: That's where Franklin seems most likely of an imperfect batch. He's similar to Alec Pierce in some ways but does have an explosive profile. En route to hauling in 1,383 yards and 14 touchdowns for Oregon last year, he ranks fourth in this receivers class in yards after catch per reception, fourth in explosive play rate and first in expected points added per route run.\n\nThe pick: Troy Franklin, WR, Oregon\n\n47: Bo Nix, QB, Giants; 48. Patrick Paul, T, Jaguars; 49. Ennis Rakestraw Jr., CB, Bengals; 50. Payton Wilson, LB, Eagles; 51. Malachi Corley, WR, Steelers; 52. Bralen Trice, DE, Rams; 53. Christian Jones, T, Eagles; 54. T'Vondre Sweat, DT, Browns; 55. Xavier Legette, WR, Dolphins; 56. Kingsley Suamatala, T, Cowboys; 57. Roger Rosengarten, T, Buccaneers; 58. Zach Frazier, C/G, Packers; 59. Chris Braswell, DE, Texans; 60. Marshawn Kneeland, DE, Bills; 61. Ruke Orhorhoro, DT, Lions; 62. Jonathon Brooks, RB, Ravens; 63. Christian Haynes, C/G, 49ers; 64. Cooper Beebe, C/G, Chiefs. THIRD ROUND 65. DeWayne Carter, DT, Panthers; 66. Javon Baker, WR, Cardinals; 67. Andru Phillips, CB, Commanders; 68. Maason Smith, DT, Patriots; 69. Cade Stover, TE, Chargers; 70. Cam Hart, CB, Giants; 71. Mike Sainristil, CB, Cardinals; 72. Max Melton, CB, Jets; 73. Cole Bishop, S, Lions; 74. Blake Corum, RB, Falcons; 75. Dominick Puni, T, Bears; 76. Adisa Isaac, DE, Broncos; 77. Ja'Lynn Polk, WR, Raiders; 78. Javon Bullard, S, Commanders; 79. T.J. Tampa, CB, Falcons; 80. Brandon Dorius, DT, Bengals; 81. Brandon Coleman, C/G, Seahawks.\n\nErickson: We have back-to-back picks now at No. 82 and No. 83. The spoils of our ill-fated trade back in the first.\n\nAtkins: We have addressed the top two needs but that leaves us in a weird spot to make two picks after a significant drop-off in talent. It might be time to check off some smaller needs like running back, linebacker or backup edge rusher. But with a free third-round pick, we can also take a swing on a talented player and let life find a way, too.\n\nErickson: There are not a lot of players in this range with the athletic gifts the Colts typically prioritize in the draft. At least with the draft boards we are using. At the LEO position, Houston Christian's Jalyx Hunt has elite athletic traits but played at a small school; Utah's Jonah Elliss is coming off shoulder surgery but had 12 sacks last season.\n\nAtkins: Both seem like interesting developmental swings, the types the Colts usually take on the edge. Granted, those usually have not worked. But they believe a lot in new defensive line coach Charlie Partridge to get the most out of athletic bodies, so I think this is the type of range where they'll take one if they haven't yet.\n\nErickson: Hunt is a bit more of a project. But he's a better fit for the athletic profile Indianapolis has prioritized in the past, and Ballard loves the small-school players. Bet on the upside.\n\nThe pick: Jalyx Hunt, DE, Houston Christian\n\nAtkins: Time to make a pick with the extra selection from the Rams that felt like a good idea at the time. With the caliber of players left at this spot, it feels like a depth pick is what is likely here. I think running back is a good possibility. It'd be nice to find a player with return skills at either wide receiver or cornerback.\n\nErickson: We already did! DeJean was an excellent return man at Iowa. But I think there's a lot to be said for backup running back. The presence of Zack Moss ended up being important last season.\n\nAtkins: I like Trey Benson from Florida State, and I think the Colts will, too. His RAS score is an outrageous 9.71 out of 10, thanks to 4.39-second speed at 6-0 and 215 pounds.\n\nErickson: Not a lot of things went the way we hoped in this scenario. But we gave Shane Steichen the explosive abilities he covets.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mitchell is the freakiest cover corner in the draft, with a dynamic game that matches his supreme gifts.\"\n\nColts Wire's breakdown: Mitchell has been a very popular pick for the Colts at 15th overall, and it's easy to see why. He's a tremendous athlete, which GM Chris Ballard has emphasized heavily in the last two drafts. Mitchell has the ability to play both man and zone, along with bringing a level of physicality in the run game from the cornerback position. He's also had excellent ball production, with six interceptions and 27 pass breakups in the last two seasons.\n\nPositional need: Addressing cornerback is either 1A or 1B on the Colts' to-do list in this draft. This was a young position group last season that, as should have been expected, battled consistency issues. Overall, explosive pass plays happened far too often, along with the Colts ranking 22nd in both pass breakups and yards per pass attempt allowed. Ballard recently said that getting Dallis Flowers back will be important, and young players like Jaylon Jones are no longer rookies, so improvement is expected. However, there are obvious risks that come with banking on that happening.\n\nPlayer Info\n\nHeight: 6-01\n\nWeight: 195\n\nAge: 22\n\nBench: 20\n\n40-yard dash: 4.33\n\nVertical: 38''\n\nBroad: 10-0\n\nRAS: 9.80\n\nPre-Draft visit: No\n\nSenior Bowl invitee: Yes\n\nConsensus big board ranking: 11th\n\nWhat Lance Zierlein of NFL.com had to say: \"Mitchell possesses a gumbo of traits, with size, strength and speed filling up the pot. He's built like a running back, tackles like a safety and has the ball skills of a cornerback. Mitchell can play in a variety of coverages and was the clear-cut top cornerback at the Senior Bowl when working against the top receivers in practice. While he needs to trace a more efficient path when hounding the route, his burst to close and physicality at the catch point could create tougher throwing windows for quarterbacks. Mitchell's traits, play demeanor and special-teams potential should make him attractive to teams in the market for CB help.\"", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colts Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bretl@coltswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Paul Bretl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bucky Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mock draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Zierlein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Zierlein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://coltswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/03/USATSI_22659713.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

It wasn't easy, though, and there were countless chances to succumb to past mistakes leading up to the season finale win over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nNow with the draft just hours away, everyone in the division is chasing Houston, hoping to see the crown come to their stadium last this winter.\n\nIndianapolis, which holds the most division titles with nine, hasn't claimed the crown since 2014. Tennessee underwent a massive overhaul this offseason after failing to make the postseason back-to-back years, spending aggressively in free agency as a sign of confidence in rookie quarterback Will Levis.\n\nJacksonville, the previous champion before Houston, collapsed in the back half of the season with a first-place schedule. While a promising player, there have been debates on whether the franchise should pay quarterback Trevor Lawrence top dollar. The Jaguars, which added talents like Gabe Davis, Devin Duvernay and Arik Armstead, should be poised for a promising third season under Doug Pederson and Lawrence looks to solidify his status as a top-10 quarterback, both in on-field play and annual salary.\n\nAll four AFC South franchises feature quarterbacks on rookie deals. They've all gone out of their way to build the team around them while they're at their cheapest, adding premier talents like Stefon Diggs, Calvin Ridley, Tony Pollard, and others.\n\nThe draft is the final piece to the offseason puzzle. Prospects added here are talents that could elevate a roster from good to playoff-bound. Just ask the Texans if they would have hosted a wild-card game in January without C.J. Stroud and Will Anderson Jr.\n\nHere are the draft rumors Texans fans should be paying attention to when it comes to the other AFC South foes.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nHouston Texans linebacker Christian Harris (48) brings down Indianapolis Colts quarterback Gardner Minshew II (10) on Saturday, Jan. 6, 2024, during a game against the Houston Texans at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Colts overachieved in the eyes of many last year, with backup quarterback Gardner Minshew filling in for injured rookie Anthony Richardson.\n\nIndianapolis took a different approach to the offense, locking up its key players for the future on new deals like Deforest Buckner and Michael Pittman Jr.\n\nGeneral manager Chris Ballard made it clear last Friday during the pre-draft presser that he's \"open to whatever,\" and could be willing to trade up or down for the right price.\n\nThe Colts currently own the No.15 pick, so they'll have to make a significant jump to grab one of the draft's top wideouts. Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer, Jim Irsay could be willing to move up for LSU's Malik Nabers or Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nBreer also suggested the Colts may be \"full-go\" on Georgia tight end Brock Bowers should land outside the top 10 picks. He's a polarizing player as an undersized in-line tight end who doesn't provide much blocking, but Colts coach and offensive mastermind Shane Steichen is one of the league's more creative play designers.\n\nIn his final mock draft, ESPN's Matt Miller said that the Colts have had numerous phone calls and texts over the past week with Texas receiver Xavier Worthy.\n\nLast month, Worthy set the NFL Combine record for the fastest 40-yard dash at 4.21 seconds.\n\nIndianapolis seems determined to surround Richardson with more weapons, but if the top four targets are gone, it could pivot to cornerback. Earlier this offseason, the Colts explored a trade for Chiefs cornerback L'Jarius Snead, who eventually was shipped off to rival Tennessee\n\nAlabama's Terrion Arnold and Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell are two potential prospects on Indinapolis' radar.\n\nIn the latest mock draft from Touchdown Wire, the Colts selected LSU receiver Brian Thomas Jr. after missing out on Nabers, Harrison, Bowers and Washington's Rome Odunze.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\n(Melina Myers-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhile the Jags finished with the same 9-8 record that won them the division in 2022, it was clear they took a step back last season.\n\nThey've been linked to San Francisco 49ers' disgruntled star receiver Brandon Aiyuk since the start of free agency. Accoridg to Breer, Jacksonville's staff has also \"done their homework\" on the top three wideouts in this year's draft for a potential trade up.\n\nThe Jaguars are without a legit No. 1 receiver after Calvin Ridley unexpectedly departed in free agency. Jacksonville could take a pass-catcher with the No. 17 overall pick, but likely would be either Texas' Adonai Mitchell or Thomas over Nabers, Odunze, or Harrison.\n\nJacksonville may also look to upgrade its secondary, tailoring it to match the scheme of new defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen. He prefers man-to-man coverage, so either Arnold or Mitchell being top options.\n\nIn Touchdown Wire's latest mock draft, the Jaguars land Mitchell to play opposite Tyson Campbell and create one of the top young defensive back duos in the league.\n\nThe Jaguars added Armstead to the defensive line on a three-year deal, but Illinois' Jer'Zhan \"Johnny\" Newton might be another player to monitor if the opportunity arises. Bryon Murphy, the former Texas defensive tackle, is expected to be one of the first defensive players off the board. He might be the pipeline dream for fans should he slide outside the top 15 picks.\n\nJacksonville could be active on Thursday as it looks to compete with the Texans for the division title.\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nDec 31, 2023; Houston, Texas, USA; Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins (12) runs after a catch against Tennessee Titans cornerback Roger McCreary (21) in the second quarter at NRG Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Thomas Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMike Vrabel's tenure as the Tennesse's coach ended after the season, and former Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan is the new man in command.\n\nTennessee returns Levis, who flashed throughout his rookie campaign but left plenty of the imagination, for one more season. He could be the heir-apparent to Ryan Tannehill and GM Ran Canthon intends to have his answer before Christmas. Levis should have little to complain about when it comes to his personnel after the Titans signed Ridley, Pollard and standout center Lloyd Cushenberry to multi-year deals. On defense, Tennessee also bolstered its secondary by trading for Sneed.\n\nLeft tackle remains the one glaring hole left on the roster. The Titans are in a prime spot with the No. 7 pick to take one of the draft's top tackles in Notre Dame's Joe Alt or Alabama's JC Latham.\n\nDepending on how the top five picks fall, teams may call Tennessee looking to move up. While the offensive line selection seems cut and dry, The Athletic's Dianna Russini wouldn't rule out Carthon landing another weapon.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if the Titans go wide receiver,\" Russini wrote.\n\nRidley is 29, and opposite is former Houston star DeAndre Hopkins, who turns 32 in June. Carthon, who previously worked with Ryans in San Francisco, wasn't a part of the staff that drafted former first-rounder Treylon Burks, so Tennessee may take one of the top three wideouts.\n\nThis isn't shocking given the construction of the front office and their roles in previous drafts. Carton was on San Francisco's staff when the 49ers passed on adding a tackle for Aiyuk in 2020. Callahan was a part of Cincinnati's staff when it passed on Oregon's Penei Sewell for LSU's Ja'Marr Chase in 2021.\n\nLastest Mock Drafts\n\nThe NFL draft will be held in Detroit for the first time.\n\nIn the latest mock draft from The Athletic's Dane Brugler, the Titans strike first by adding Alt with the 7th overall pick. He should be the sturdy blindside blocker in Nashville for the next decade.\n\nWhile Brugler mentioned that Indianapolis could be in the market to trade up for a receiver -- Nabers specifically -- he has the franchise bolstering its secondary with the addition of Mitchell. The Rockets' star stays close to home and now becomes the Colts' top defensive back .\n\nWith the 17th pick, the Jaguars actually move down with Buffalo to pick No. 28. They too add another name to their secondary with Alabama's Kool-Aid McKinstry.\n\nTexans Wire Mock Draft\n\nThe main stage as work goes on at the NFL Draft Theater near Campus Martius in Detroit on Tuesday, April 23, 2024.\n\nTexans Wire's Cole Thompson recently released his first-round mock draft and had a few surprises added to the mix.\n\nLike most, Thompson has the Titans adding Alt with the No. 7 pick. Unlike most, he has Tennessee trading back into the first round for the 30th overall pick to add a home run-caliber pass-catcher in Worthy. This should create one of the more underrated receiver trios in the league while also bettering the offensive line.\n\nFrom those close to Lucas Oil Stadium, the Colts are \"in love\" with Bowers and would love to grab him at No. 15. Thompson has Cincinnati moving up with Las Vegas to secure the two-time John Mackey winner, so the Colts are stuck between selecting Thomas and Mitchell. Jacksonville, barring a trade-up, likely is targeting both prospects, too.\n\nIn the mock, Thompson has Mitchell landing with the Colts at No. 15. Two picks later, Thomas comes off the board and heads to Duval County.", "source": {"uri": "texanswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texans Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Trading up to grab a coveted player who's falling to the Colts is on the table as well as trading back to accumulate additional picks.\n\nThe latter should be an attractive prop bet in Vegas. The Colts enter tonight's draft with seven overall picks. No one expects them to exit the draft with that many.\n\nIn the weeks and months leading up to the draft, the focus has been on how Ballard will handle the No. 15 overall pick. By adding a starting cornerback? How about giving Shane Steichen and Anthony Richardson a big-play wideout?\n\nIn four of his seven previous drafts, Ballard has traded down or out of the first round entirely (2018, '19, '20, '22). He's yet to move up.\n\nBut let's not discount the importance of the seven-round, 257-pick process.\n\nDuring the Bill Polian era, the Colts found career sack leader Robert Mathis in round 5 of the 2003 draft (No. 138 overall) and safety Antoine Bethea, who would start 200 games during a 14-year career, in round 6 of '06 with the 207th pick.\n\nThree of Ballard's biggest third-day hits: linebacker Zaire Franklin (round 7, No. 235 in '18), defensive tackle Grover Stewart (round 4, No. 144 in '17) and linebacker E.J. Speed (round 5, No. 164 in '19). All have earned second or third contracts. Cornerback Jaylon Jones, who started 10 games as a rookie, was a seventh-rounder (No. 221) last April.\n\nThe infatuation with round 1 is understandable. Hitting on that pick, especially in the top half and particularly when it involves a quarterback, can have lasting impact. Conversely, missing on a quarterback can set a franchise back a half-dozen years. Minimum.\n\nMarvin Harrison, Tarik Glenn, Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, Reggie Wayne, Dwight Freeney, Dallas Clark, Marlin Jackson, Anthony Castonzo, Andrew Luck, Ryan Kelly, Quenton Nelson and, the team hopes, Anthony Richardson.\n\nHere's a recap of how Ballard has handled his first-round picks since being named general manager in 2017:\n\n*Action: The Colts stayed put and selected safety Malik Hooker.\n\n*Consequence: Injuries limited Hooker to 36 appearances and 35 starts in four seasons; he missed 28 games. He's heading into his fourth season with Dallas.\n\n*Action: In March, Ballard sent the No. 3 pick to the New York Jets for No. 6, two second-rounders in the '18 draft (Nos. 37 and 49) and the Jets' 2019 second-rounder (No. 34). During the draft, he sent No. 49 to Philadelphia and received the Eagles' second-rounder (No. 52) and fifth-rounder (No. 169).\n\n*Consequence: The Colts came away with perennial All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson (No. 6), right tackle Braden Smith (No. 37), defensive end Kemoko Turay (No. 52) and running back Jordan Wilkins (No. 169). With the Jets' 2019 second-rounder, they selected cornerback Rock Ya-Sin.\n\n*Action: Ballard traded out of round 1. He sent No. 26 to Washington in return for the Commanders' second-round pick (No. 46) and a 2020 second-rounder (No. 34). He then traded No. 46 to Cleveland for the Browns' second-rounder (No. 49) and fifth-rounder (No. 144).\n\n*Consequence: The Colts selected linebacker Ben Banogu at No. 49 and cornerback Marvell Tell III at No. 144. Neither panned out.\n\n*Action: Indy sent No. 13 to San Francisco for defensive tackle DeForest Buckner.\n\n*Consequence: Buckner has established himself as one of the NFL's premier 3-technique tackles. He's missed just one game in four seasons, was first-team All-Pro in 2020 and has been selected to two Pro Bowls.\n\n*Don't forget: The No. 34 pick obtained from Washington was used on wideout Michael Pittman Jr.\n\n*Action: None. The Colts selected defensive end Kwity Paye.\n\n*Consequence: Paye has been a four-year fixture with 18.5 sacks, 21 tackles for loss in 43 starts.\n\n*Action: In February 2021, the Colts sent No. 16 overall in the '22 draft and a '21 third-rounder to Philadelphia in exchange for quarterback Carson Wentz.\n\n*Consequence: Ouch. Wentz started all 17 games in 2021, but the 9-8 season disintegrated into a late collapse that cost the Colts a playoff spot. In March 2022, he was traded to Washington.\n\n*Action: None. The Colts selected their quarterback of the future, Anthony Richardson.\n\n*Consequence: We'll see. A concussion and shoulder surgery limited Richardson to four starts as a rookie.\n\nYou can follow Mike Chappell on Twitter at @mchappell51.", "source": {"uri": "fox59.com", "dataType": "news",

The Colts have a lot of young, developing options on the roster, but there are opportunities to bolster depth, add more competition and potentially upgrade the ceiling at several positions in an effort to transform Indianapolis into a regular playoff presence in the AFC.\n\nColts depth chart\n\nThe Colts spent big money in free agency to bring back 11 of their 15 free agents, then only signed two players from the outside in free agency, leaving the roster relatively the same as it was at the end of the season.\n\nStarters: Bernhard Raimann, Quenton Nelson, Ryan Kelly, Will Fries, Braden Smith\n\nBackups: Blake Freeland, Wesley French, Danny Pinter, Josh Sills, Arlington Hambright\n\nBackups/Contributors: Dayo Odeyingbo, Tyquan Lewis, Raekwon Davis, Taven Bryan, Eric Johnson, Adetomiwa Adebawore\n\nBackups/Contributors: Ronnie Harrison, Segun Olubi, Grant Stuard, Cameron McGrone\n\nBackups/Contributors: Dallis Flowers, Darrell Baker Jr., Chris Lammons, Ameer Speed\n\nWhen it's all laid out, the needs the Colts have to fill jump off the page.

The Colts' top two picks from this draft contributed to their 51-sack attack in 2023 and hope to build on that. Kylen Granson showed some flash as a downfield tight end, and Will Fries was the Colts' starting right guard. Players still on the roster are entering the final season of their rookie contract.\n\nDeForest Buckner led the Colts with 9.5 sacks in 2020, and Denico Autry (7.5) had moved on in free agency. They needed help on the edge. Paye had 4 sacks as a rookie, then 6, then 8.5 in his third season. He also forced 2 fumbles in 2023.\n\nHow concerned were the Colts about their pass rush that offseason? They picked Odeyingo despite his injury concerns at Vanderbilt. Odeyingbo's rookie season was delayed by seven weeks as he recovered from injury. He had 5 sacks in 2022, and 8 in 2023. He also forced 2 fumbles in '23.\n\nTight end had been a strength position in previous seasons, but Eric Ebron moved on and Jack Doyle's career was winding down. Granson has become a larger part of the offense with each season, catching 30 passes on 50 targets for 368 yards (12.3 per catch) and a touchdown in 2023.\n\nEhlinger started three games in 2022, passing for 3 TDs, and appeared in one game in '23.\n\nFries saw little time as a rookie, filled in under less-than-ideal circumstances in 2022 and locked down the starting right guard job in '23.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylen_Granson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylen Granson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Fries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Fries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeForest_Buckner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeForest Buckner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_Commodores_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt Commodores football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Doyle_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Doyle (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Pick_Two", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Pick Two", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/23/PIND/73431763007-odey-kwity.jpg?auto=webp&crop=817,459,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

However, the draft board had different ideas in mind.\n\nBy the time the Colts were picking, Terrion Arnold, Quinyon Mitchell, Brian Thomas Jr., and Brock Bowers were all off the board. So, I thought it was best to trade down-a realistic option for the Colts during the actual draft.\n\n\"I just go off history,\" said GM Chris Ballard about trading down during his pre-draft press conference. \"The more picks you have the better chance you have to hit. Now, of course, you're not going to hit on all of them, but it gives you a better chance to hit.\"\n\nI ended up moving back to pick 24 with Dallas. Using the Rich Hill trade value chart, I traded picks 15 and 191 to the Cowboys for picks 24 and 56 in return, giving me two second-round picks and four in the top 100.\n\nHere is a look at each of those picks, along with a breakdown of what you need to know.\n\n1.24: Xavier Worthy, WR, Texas\n\nTexas Longhorns wide receiver Xavier Worthy (1) celebrates a play in the fourth quarter of the Sugar Bowl College Football Playoff semi-finals at the Ceasars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, Jan. 1, 2024. The Huskies won the game 37-31.\n\nBreakdown: By trading down, I was operating under the assumption that either Xavier Worthy or Adonai Mitchell would be available. Both players were, and ultimately, I went with Mitchell and his 4.21 speed. Mitchell will bring that needed playmaking to the offense, both as a vertical threat and in getting him the ball in space so he can pick up YAC. On top of that, Worthy's presence pre-snap as a motion man can cause some chaos for the defense\n\n2.46: Marshawn Kneeland, Edge Western Michigan\n\nFeb 3, 2024; Mobile, AL, USA; American offensive lineman Javon Foster of Missouri (75) battle National edge Marshawn Kneeland of Western Michigan (99) during the second half of the 2024 Senior Bowl football game at Hancock Whitney Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBreakdown: The Colts need more consistency from their pass rush in 2024 if they hope to replicate their 2023 sack production. From a size, length, and athleticism standpoint, Kneeland is exactly what teams look for in an edge rusher. He will make an immediate impact on the Colts' rotation and held up well against both the run and the pass at Western Michigan.\n\n2.56: Max Melton, CB, Rutgers\n\nOct 7, 2022; Piscataway, New Jersey, USA; Rutgers Scarlet Knights defensive back Max Melton (16) celebrates after an interception during the first half against the Nebraska Cornhuskers at SHI Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBreakdown: A very good athlete and a cornerback willing to help out in the run game. Melton has the ability to play both inside and out, providing the Colts with a backup option behind Kenny Moore, but right away, he has the ability to compete for that starting boundary spot across from JuJu Brents. Melton had three interceptions in 2023 and held opponents to a completion rate of 54 percent.\n\n3.82: Dadrion Taylor-Demerson, S, Texas Tech\n\nTexas Tech's defensive back Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (1) intercepts the ball against TCU in a Big 12 football game, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023, at Jones AT&T Stadium.\n\nBreakdown: Taylor-Demerson is one of the best centerfield safeties in this class and would pair excellently next to Julian Blackmon. Taylor-Demerson would compete immediately for the starting free safety role in this Colts' defense, and the addition provides some long-term stability at a position where the Colts don't have much of that. Taylor-Demerson recorded 10 interceptions and 15 pass breakups in the last three seasons.\n\n4.117: Tanor Bortolini, IOL, Wisconsin\n\nMark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBreakdown: The interior offensive line is in great shape for 2024, but next offseason, Ryan Kelly and Will Fries are both set to be free agents. Bortolini tested incredibly well at the NFL Combine and has the ability to play all three interior positions.\n\n5.151: Trevin Wallace, LB, Kentucky\n\nKentucky's Trevin Wallace recovers the fumble and moves the ball against Florida Saturday afternoon.\n\nSept. 30, 2023\n\nBreakdown: Wallace brings upside to a position that needs a bit more of it and tremendous athleticism. Behind Zaire Franklin and EJ Speed on the depth chart are a lot of unknowns. Wallace's biggest impact early on may come on special teams, but he was effective as a blitzer at Kentucky and a very sound tackler.\n\n7.234: Jalen Sundell, OT, North Dakota State\n\nMar 2, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; North Dakota State offensive lineman Jalen Sundell (OL66) talks to the media during the 2024 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBreakdown: For one, I think this is an excellent value pick for the Colts. Sundell was dominant at the FCS level and while he played left tackle in 2023, he has over 1,100 career snaps at center as well. Tackle is a position where the Colts need more depth for the summer, with only four tackles on the current roster.", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colts

Mandatory Credit: Lon Horwedel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt's easy to love everything that Mitchell brings to the table. He's an excellent athlete, can play man or zone, and he is a physical player at this position. Mitchell was also dominant against his competition and had terrific ball production-something this Colts' defense needs more of. Mitchell would be an immediate Day 1 starter at the Colts' biggest position of need and can be a true impact player, who makes everyone around him better.\n\nEdge Rusher: Marshawn Kneeland, Western Michigan\n\nFeb 3, 2024; Mobile, AL, USA; American offensive lineman Javon Foster of Missouri (75) battle National edge Marshawn Kneeland of Western Michigan (99) during the second half of the 2024 Senior Bowl football game at Hancock Whitney Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSize at 267 pounds. Length with 34-inch arms. And athleticism with a RAS of 9.08. Marshawn Kneeland checks pretty much all the boxes that teams look for in an edge rusher. Kneeland made an impact as both a run defender and pass rusher in college, and would become an immediate member of the Colts' edge rusher rotation, that does have to get after the quarterback more consistently this season if they want to duplicate their 2023 sack production.\n\nInterior Offensive Line: Tanor Bortolini, Wisconsin\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBortolini crushed it at the NFL Combine and was one of the most impressive interior offensive linemen at the entire event. He's an experienced player coming out of Wisconsin who gives the Colts some flexibility with his ability to play all three interior offensive line positions. Looking ahead to the 2025 offseason, both Ryan Kelly and Will Fries are set to be free agents at the moment.\n\nWide Receiver: Brian Thomas Jr., LSU\n\nMatthew Hinton-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Colts want more playmaking on offense and Thomas would certainly bring that element to the table. Last season at LSU, Thomas averaged over 17 yards per catch and scored 17 touchdowns. The Shane Steichen offense needs to have a vertical presence to stretch the field, and Thomas would provide that from Day 1. The other aspect that I really like about adding Thomas to the offense is that when a defense has to respect an offense's ability to push the ball downfield, that'll help open up opportunities for Josh Downs and Michael Pittman over the middle and on underneath routes as well. Thomas' impact is two-fold.\n\nTight End: Tip Reiman, Illinois\n\nNov 25, 2023; Champaign, Illinois, USA; Illinois Fighting Illini tight end Tip Reiman (89) reacts after scoring a two-point conversion on a pass and run pas Northwestern Wildcats linebacker Bryce Gallagher (32) during the second half at Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Ron Johnson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe obvious choice here is Brock Bowers, who would be a terrific addition to the Colts offense. However, I didn't want to be too predictable, which I know I've already done at cornerback and receiver, so I went in a different direction. Reiman fills the traditional Y-tight end role as a primary blocker, where he stood out at the college level. With Mo Alie-Cox entering the final year of his deal, the Colts should be proactive and search for a potential in-line replacement. Reiman also tested extremely well, posting a RAS of 9.92, so there is some pass-catching upside that can be unlocked.\n\nSafety: Dadrion Taylor-Demerson, Texas Tech\n\nTexas Tech's defensive back Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (1) intercepts the ball against TCU in a Big 12 football game, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023, at Jones AT&T Stadium.\n\nOne of the better deep safeties in this draft class. Taylor-Demerson, from a skill-set standpoint, would be a terrific match for Julian Blackmon. Taylor-Demerson is a potential Day 2 selection who could compete for the starting free safety spot right away and provide some long-term stability to a position that is lacking in that area. He's had good ball production the last three seasons, totaling 10 interceptions and 15 pass breakups.\n\nLinebacker: Cedric Gray, North Carolina\n\nJan 31, 2024; Mobile, AL, USA; National linebacker Cedric Gray of North Carolina (33) works in coverage during practice for the National team at Hancock Whitney Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLinebacker is a sneaky need for the Colts. Behind Zaire Franklin and EJ Speed on the depth chart are quite a few unknowns, not to mention that Speed is entering a contract year and will be a free agent in 2025. Gray's ability in coverage would provide a nice complement to the skill sets that the Colts already have on the roster, and he could establish himself early on as a third-down or obvious passing-down presence. Over the last two seasons, Gray has limited pass-catchers to just 8.1 yards per catch and totaled three interceptions and seven pass breakups.", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType":

The Washington star drops into an Indianapolis skill group that already includes receivers Michael Pittman and Josh Downs and running back Jonathan Taylor, giving Richardson an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the supporting cast around him.\"\n\nColts Wire's breakdown: This is a very deep wide receiver class overall, but don't be mistaken; there is a dropoff in talent after the top three receivers in this class, one of which is Odunze, are off the board. He can be a go-to option, and he can win at all levels of the field and do so in a variety of ways. A receiver of Odunze's caliber has gravity, creating opportunities for others.\n\nPositional need: The Colts' need for a receiver is two-fold. Priority No. 1 is that they need to add more playmaking around Anthony Richardson. While Michael Pittman and Josh Downs certainly provide a strong foundation at the position, both players averaged fewer than 12.0 yards per catch last season. On top of that, the overall depth of this unit could be improved as well in an effort to raise the floor. Right now, behind Pittman and Downs are several question marks.\n\nDraft profile from Daniel Jeremiah: \"Odunze is a big, athletic wideout with exceptional hands. He can play outside or in the slot. He is refined and polished in everything he does on the field. He uses a variety of releases at the line of scrimmage and is a clean route runner. He uses his strength to lean into defenders before separating out of the break point. He thrives in traffic, possessing the ability to pluck the football and absorb big shots over the middle of the field. He makes some incredible adjustments on poorly thrown balls. He tracks naturally over his shoulder. After the catch, he is very tough to bring down and has some nifty make-miss ability. He plays with a ton of passion and energy. Overall, Odunze is a complete player and reminds me of Larry Fitzgerald coming out of college.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Richardson_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Richardson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jeremiah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jeremiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Fitzgerald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Fitzgerald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1Ly60IN7Br3agINOU2zXWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/indianapolis_colts_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_945/41b27ffd528a214511759b59c9bf84d8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Now of course you're not going to hit on all of them, but it gives you more of a chance to hit,\n\n\"Look, we've moved up. We moved up for Jonathan Taylor (in 2020). When we see one that's in striking distance that we think we can go get, we'll do it. But it's got to work out, and then you've got to have somebody that wants to make the trade.\"\n\nOne consistent element of Ballard's previous seven drafts with Indianapolis has been a tendency toward need in the early rounds.\n\nCornerback, free safety, wide receiver and tight end are the positions that could be most immediately impacted by a high-round rookie this year. And Ballard might look to add an edge rusher with a decision looming on Kwity Paye's fifth-year option and Dayo Odeyingbo entering the final year of his rookie contract.\n\nThe balance between selecting a player who can be a difference maker quickly and looking further into the roster's future is one every draft war room deals with.\n\n\"I think that's the general coaching-scouting tug and pull that you get where we're looking at, 'Two years from now this guy is up. We'll draft this guy to replace him,'\" Ballard said. \"In coaching, you're like, 'Screw that. I need (help) today.' It's definitely a balance.\"\n\nThe coaching-scouting balance could be a benefit in this year's draft.\n\nA year ago, Colts head coach Shane Steichen was still learning the active roster, hiring his staff and settling into a top job for the first time throughout the draft process.\n\nThis year, he's been able to work more closely with the personnel department and have a greater voice in the process.\n\nThere's a school of thought that could lead to an offensive player being selected in Round 1 - particularly a pass catcher.\n\nBut Steichen said he doesn't view the draft in terms of offense vs. defense.\n\n\"I think honestly (I prefer) whatever gives us the best chance to win,\" he said. \"I really do believe that. Even though I'm an offensive backgrounded guy, I do believe you take a really good player. It doesn't matter offense or defense - a player that's going to help you get better.\"\n\nBallard confirmed Steichen's been a bigger part of the process this year.\n\nAnd he said that's been a positive development all around.\n\nSteichen and his staff have a better understanding of how the scouts go about their duties, and the scouts in turn have a better understanding of what traits the coaches are looking for at each position.\n\nThe result should be a more collaborative process in Year 2.\n\n\"It's really good because it makes it - when you go in there and you start looking at players together and then when (Steichen) starts looking at the board and can tell, 'This is how we'll use this guy. This is how he fits,'\" Ballard said. \"From a GM perspective, that's a beautiful thing now - knowing that he's got a vision quickly for the player, and it's not a vision of negativity with many guys, where he sees the strengths really quickly and will figure out a role for how this guy can play for you. That's fun. That makes it fun.\"\n\nBallard stated in January the goal of this offseason would be to add more explosion on both sides of the ball.\n\nSo far, the only outside additions through free agency have been backup defensive tackle Raekwon Davis and backup quarterback Joe Flacco. So any new explosive pieces will have to come through the draft.\n\nOne hint Ballard revealed as to how those players might be selected came through the context of second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson.\n\n\"We like what we saw, where we're going with him,\" Ballard said. \"... Block and protect. That's one of the most - you just look through the league and you just look through the playoff teams, they all can block and protect. I think that's critical. I think that's (priority) one.\n\n\"I remember Andrew (Luck) used to tell me all the time, 'Chris, get me protected. I will get the ball to them. Give me guys that will catch it and get to the right spot, and I will make the rest work.' Most of the really good ones, that's how they kind of roll. Do they want the superstar (receiver) out there? Absolutely, but protection to me is always first and foremost.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In this scenario, I have them staying put and picking Murphy, a fast-rising DT, who could end up being selected even earlier than this.\"\n\nColts Wire's breakdown: A position of strength for the Colts gets even stronger with the addition of Murphy. From Day 1, Murphy is a three-down defender who can impact both the run and the passing games. He's an excellent athlete and played out of both the A and B-gaps at Texas. Murphy led all interior defenders last season in pass-rush win rate and ranked 41st in run-stop rate.\n\nPositional need: Well, there isn't much of one. If the Colts were to take Murphy it's all about taking the best avialble player on their board. This offseason, the Colts re-signed Grover Stewart to a three-year deal. They extended DeForest Buckner through 2026 and signed Raekwon Davis to a two-year deal. With that said, success for any defense starts with a quick push up the middle, and the Colts would have a top-end rotation.\n\nPlayer Info\n\nHeight: 6-0\n\nWeight: 297\n\nAge: 21\n\n40-yard dash: 4.87 seconds\n\nVertical leap: 33''\n\nBroad jump: 9-03\n\nThree-cone: 7.5 seconds\n\nShort shuttle: 4.5 seconds\n\nBench press: 28\n\nRAS: 9.20\n\nPre-draft visit: No\n\nSenior Bowl: Yes\n\nConsensus big board ranking: 13th\n\nDaniel Jeremiah's draft profile: \"Murphy is a very explosive, nimble and instinctive defensive tackle. He is a dynamic disruptor against the pass game. He explodes out of his stance and can roll his hips on contact, creating instant push. He consistently gets underneath blockers and prevails in the leverage battle. He has quick hands to win with swipe moves, a push/pull maneuver or a violent club. Once he feels a blocker leaning left or right, he has elite change-of-direction quickness. Against the run, he can utilize his quickness to penetrate and create negative plays. He also has incredible balance to take on blocks while going to one knee before uncoiling and making plays. (I haven't seen anyone else use this technique before, but it's very effective.)

The Washington star drops into an Indianapolis skill group that already includes receivers Michael Pittman and Josh Downs and running back Jonathan Taylor, giving Richardson an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the supporting cast around him.\"\n\nColts Wire's breakdown: This is a very deep wide receiver class overall, but don't be mistaken; there is a dropoff in talent after the top three receivers in this class, one of which is Odunze, are off the board. He can be a go-to option, and he can win at all levels of the field and do so in a variety of ways. A receiver of Odunze's caliber has gravity, creating opportunities for others.\n\nPositional need: The Colts' need for a receiver is two-fold. Priority No. 1 is that they need to add more playmaking around Anthony Richardson. While Michael Pittman and Josh Downs certainly provide a strong foundation at the position, both players averaged fewer than 12.0 yards per catch last season. On top of that, the overall depth of this unit could be improved as well in an effort to raise the floor. Right now, behind Pittman and Downs are several question marks.\n\nPlayer Info\n\nHeight: 6-3\n\nWeight: 212\n\nAge: 21\n\n40-yard dash: 4.45 seconds\n\nVertical leap: 39''\n\nBroad jump: 10-04\n\nThree-cone: 6.88 seconds\n\nShort shuttle: 4.03 seconds\n\nBench press: N/A\n\nRAS: 9.92\n\nPre-draft visit: No\n\nSenior Bowl: No\n\nConsensus big board ranking: 6th\n\nDraft profile from Daniel Jeremiah: \"Odunze is a big, athletic wideout with exceptional hands. He can play outside or in the slot. He is refined and polished in everything he does on the field. He uses a variety of releases at the line of scrimmage and is a clean route runner. He uses his strength to lean into defenders before separating out of the break point. He thrives in traffic, possessing the ability to pluck the football and absorb big shots over the middle of the field. He makes some incredible adjustments on poorly thrown balls. He tracks naturally over his shoulder. After the catch, he is very tough to bring down and has some nifty make-miss ability. He plays with a ton of passion and energy. Overall, Odunze is a complete player and reminds me of Larry Fitzgerald coming out of college.\"", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colts Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bretl@coltswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Paul Bretl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mock draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Richardson_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Richardson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ringer_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ringer (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jeremiah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jeremiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Fitzgerald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Fitzgerald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bench press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://coltswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/03/USATSI_22249968.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504879", "eventUri": "eng-9504879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Jones/USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMock draft: Eric Edholm - NFL.com\n\nPick 9 (TRADE): Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nWhat Edholm had to say: \"If the Bears could get more Day 2 ammunition, I think they'd strongly consider moving down here. For the Colts, it would be a rare move up, but if GM Chris Ballard wants Bowers, he might have to get aggressive to move in front of the Jets.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Bucky Brooks - NFL.com\n\nPick 15: Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\n\nWhat Brooks had to say: \"General manager Chris Ballard is all about drafting talented prospects with prototypical traits and athleticism. Mitchell is the freakiest cover corner in the draft, with a dynamic game that matches his supreme gifts.\"\n\nRob Rang, Fox Sports: Cooper DeJean, CB, Iowa\n\nJeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Rob Rang - Fox Sports\n\nPick 15: Cooper DeJean, CB, Iowa\n\nWhat Rang had to say: \"There are always a few surprises on draft day, and if DeJean were to be the first defensive back off the board this year, that would qualify as a mild upset -- at least from a media perspective. Of course, general manager Chris Ballard pulled off a similar shocker at No. 4 overall last year with the selection of quarterback Anthony Richardson. In reality, DeJean is highly regarded by NFL teams, offering a rare combination of size, agility, steady open-field tackling and ball-hawking skills to project as a future Pro Bowler.\"\n\nDanny Kelly, The Ringer: Rome Odunze, WR, Washington\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Danny Kelly - The Ringer\n\nPick 9 (TRADE): Rome Odunze, WR, Washington\n\nWhat Kelly had to say: \"The Colts make an aggressive move here to give their young franchise quarterback Anthony Richardson a big-time playmaker in Odunze.

Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Charles Davis - NFL.com\n\nPick 15: Rome Odunze, WR, Washington\n\nWhat Davis had to say: \"The run on QBs pushes a receiver with top-10 talent down to this spot, and the Colts' second-year QB, Anthony Richardson, is thrilled.\"\n\nJordan Reid, ESPN: Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\n\nDanny Wild-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Jordan Reid - ESPN\n\nPick 15: Brian Thomas Jr., WR, LSU\n\nWhat Reid had to say: \"Wide receiver or cornerback seem to be the two positions in consideration, and Thomas would bring a downfield dynamic that the offense has lacked. Michael Pittman Jr. and Josh Downs were a solid 1-2 punch last season, but when you have Anthony Richardson's huge arm under center, you need vertical threats. Alec Pierce has struggled, so I could see Indy looking to Thomas to create more explosive plays. Thomas led the FBS in touchdown receptions last season (17), and 10 of those came on vertical patterns.\"\n\nCharles McDonald, Yahoo!

Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Charles McDonald - Yahoo! Sports\n\nPick 15: Dallas Turner, Edge, Alabama\n\nWhat McDonald had to say: \"Turner's fall stops! The Colts could use another quality rusher up front and Turner would find himself in a great spot by being able to play with a star defensive lineman like DeForest Buckner. It's hard to find 21-year-old edge rushers in the draft who also run a 4.47. Don't be surprised if Turner goes much higher than this during the actual draft.\"\n\nMatt Miller, ESPN: Xavier Worthy, WR, Texas\n\nTexas Longhorns wide receiver Xavier Worthy (1) celebrates a play in the fourth quarter of the Sugar Bowl College Football Playoff semi-finals at the Ceasars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, Jan. 1, 2024. The Huskies won the game 37-31.\n\nMock draft: Matt Miller - ESPN\n\nPick 15: Xavier Worthy, WR, Texas\n\nWhat Miller had to say: \"Here's one where I'm going all-in on intel. The Colts have been linked to Worthy in numerous phone calls and texts over the past week, enough so that I'm buying it. The Colts do need speed at receiver, and Worthy has record-setting 4.21 wheels. Putting him in the mix with Michael Pittman Jr. and last year's second-rounder Josh Downs makes for a sweet trio of pass-catchers around Anthony Richardson. Imagine Worthy matched with Richardson's arm on vertical routes in Indy?\"\n\nTrevor Sikkema, PFF: Cooper DeJean, CB, Iowa\n\nJeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Trevor Sikkema - PFF\n\nPick 15: Cooper DeJean, CB, Iowa\n\nWhat Sikkema had to say: \"DeJean played mostly outside cornerback for Iowa over the past two years. At 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds, he checks the size boxes for the position and brings top-tier natural athleticism. His footwork is quick and controlled, his backpedal and shuffling are smooth, his stop-and-start speed is good for his size and his ball skills are elite. Wrap all that with a bow of high football IQ and instincts. He doesn't have much experience in press coverage but can succeed in that role. DeJean is likely the best run-defending cornerback in the class. There aren't many holes, if any, in his game.\"\n\nDave Richard, CBS Sports: Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\n\nDec 2, 2023; Detroit, MI, USA; Toledo Rockets cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (27) breaks up a pass intended for Miami (OH) Redhawks wide receiver Gage Larvadain (10) in the third quarter at Ford Field. Mandatory Credit: Lon Horwedel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMock draft: Dave Richard - CBS Sports\n\nPick 15: Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Toledo\n\nWhat Richard had to say: \"Mitchell is such a good fit for the Colts because he's fast, he's savvy in coverage and he should seamlessly fit into their zone-heavy scheme from the jump. They need him badly after allowing a completion rate of at least 60% in all but two games last season. He also might be underrated as a tackler, though his play strength could be improved.\"\n\nPete Prisco, CBS Sports: Jared Verse, Edge, Florida State\n\nDec 2, 2023; Charlotte, NC, USA; Florida State Seminoles defensive lineman Jared Verse (5) reacts during the fourth quarter against the Louisville Cardinals at Bank of America Stadium.

While the party has not made the significant gains in the local and European elections as previously projected, it has picked up some seats across the country from the 2019 local elections. Ms McDonald said the party has lessons to learn and will now reflect on where it went wrong in the election campaigns. Asked whether she will consider her position as Sinn Fein leader, Ms McDonald said: \u201cUm, you know, I will lead this reflection and this process. When the going gets tough, that\u2019s the point at which leaders step forward. They don\u2019t step down. \u201cI am incredibly proud of the team that we have. I lead a party with immense talent and immense potential. We don\u2019t always get it right. \u201cWe clearly have lessons to learn. We\u2019ve listened carefully. We will regroup. We will come out, we will do better and I, as the leader of Sinn Fein, will lead that effort.\u201d Later asked to clarify that she is committed to staying on as leader, she said: \u201cOh, absolutely. Absolutely.\u201d The Dublin TD admitted that it has not been Sinn Fein\u2019s day, and that the party has not benefited from voters who are frustrated at the government. She also said she would reflect on the number of candidates the party ran across the elections. Ms McDonald added: \u201cYou see to every voter who on this occasion chose to vote for independents or other parties rather than us, the hard work now starts by going and winning those votes back. That\u2019s it. Simple as that, complicated as that. \u201cOn the key issues, there is no doubt that there is anger, there is frustration. It hasn\u2019t been our day. \u201cWe were not the beneficiaries of any stance against the government in any substantial way. We have made some gains. So we need to crack that conundrum. And we will.\u201d She also said she would \u201cabsolutely welcome\u201d an immediate general election. \u201cWe need a change of government and by the way, I am fully acknowledging that this has not been our day. \u201cWe still have a huge, huge capacity and scope here to go out and perform and win in a general election. \u201cKey to that now increasingly as we move towards that date, is setting out very clearly, the plans and the ambitions that we have to meet and answer the issues that clearly bear down on people.\u201d Ms McDonald also said she stands by her belief that the Irish public want a change in Government, despite the coalition parties polling well in the elections. \u201cI strongly believe that there is a large section of our society that knows, that understands and that wishes to see a change of government to bring real solutions, to sort out the problems that face families and communities,\u201d she added. \u201cThe only real test for all of this is when a general election itself is called.\u201d", "summary": "Ms McDonald said the party has lessons to learn and will now reflect on where it went wrong in the election campaigns.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sinn-fein-european-government-dublin-b1163155.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/09/15/4bef5b67245ed55821b094e93faec20eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE4MDI2NTU4-2.76462495.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:06:22", "author": "Cate McCurry", "authors": ["Cate McCurry"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.101}

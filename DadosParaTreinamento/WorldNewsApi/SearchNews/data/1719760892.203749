The diplomatic move by the three western European nations on Tuesday was slammed by Israel and will have little immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza, but it was a victory for the Palestinians and could encourage other Western powers to follow suit. \"On behalf of President (Mahmoud) Abbas and the government of Palestine, the people of Palestine, we warmly welcome Spain\u2019s recognition of the state of Palestine,\" Mustafa said afterward. \"This recognition strengthens our resolve to continue our struggle for a just and lasting peace.\" BIDEN URGED TO OUTLAW ANTISEMITIC PALESTINIAN \u2018TERRORIST\u2019 GROUP BANNED IN GERMANY, ISRAEL Mustafa was joined by Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Organization of Islamic Cooperation chairman Hussain Ibrahim Taha, and the foreign ministers for Turkey and Jordan, members of the group called the Foreign Ministerial Committee of Arabic and Islamic countries for Gaza. They also met with Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares. More than 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state \u2014 more than two-thirds of the United Nations. With Spain and Ireland, there are now nine members of the 27-nation European Union that officially recognize a Palestinian state. Norway is not an EU member but its foreign policy is usually aligned with the bloc. Slovenia, an EU member, will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval.

We urge other European partners to do the same thing,\" said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. The move to recognize a Palestinian state has caused relations between the EU and Israel to nosedive. Madrid and Dublin are pushing for the EU to take measures against Israel for its continued attacks on southern Gaza\u2019s city of Rafah. The decision by Spain, Ireland and Norway comes more than seven months into an assault waged by Israel following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostage. Israel\u2019s air and land attacks have since killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between combatants and civilians.", "summary": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa after Spain, Ireland and Norway recognized Palestinian statehood.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/spain-hosts-palestines-prime-minister-recognition-palestinian-state-western-european-nations", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/931/523/Pedro-Sanchez.png?ve=1&tl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:17:08", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.433}

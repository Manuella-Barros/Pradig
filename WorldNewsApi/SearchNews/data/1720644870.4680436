Paolini held serve in the sixth game of the second set, but \u015awi\u0105tek closed out the victory when her Italian opponent sent a shot long. Top-seeded \u015awi\u0105tek rejoiced by dropping to her knees and pumping her fists, letting out a huge roar, before joining her entourage in the stands for another round of celebrations. The 23-year-old stretched her winning streak at Roland-Garros to 21 matches and her career record at the venue is now 35-2. \u015awi\u0105tek is the third player after Justine Henin (2005-07) and Monica Seles (1990-92) to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup three years in a row since tennis turned professional in 1968. She also won the French Open in 2020 and the US Open in 2022. \u015awi\u0105tek is now 5-0 in major finals. Twelfth-seeded Paolini was appearing in a major final for the first time in her career. She had never been past the second round at a major until reaching the fourth round at the Australian Open in January. Paolini will play in the French Open women's doubles final on Sunday with partner Sara Errani against Coco Gauff and Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1.

The 17-year-old striker, who joined Real Madrid from Palmeiras, knows he has a long way to go to break into the Brazilian starting line-up in a squad that includes Raphinha, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo in attack.

Everything is up to God and Professor Dorival Jr. He is a spectacular coach. He is doing what is best for the Brazilian team,\" Endrick told a press conference on Friday. Endrick, who in March became the youngest player to score in an international match at Wembley when he gave Brazil a 1-0 win over England, made his mark in the other warm-up fixtures ahead of Copa America with a goal in a 3-2 victory over Mexico, having also scored against Spain.

I'm calm and I hope I can help, I think it's right, in football you have to destabilise the other player. It's been like that since I arrived, so I've adapted and I'm very confident that I can help the team.\" Ad Break Coming Up NEXT StayNext OffEnglish 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (480p) About ConnatixV502906 About ConnatixV502906 1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE Brazil will also face Paraguay and Colombia in Group D.

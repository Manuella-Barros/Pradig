The media centre is in the city of Bari, 80 km (50 miles) from the summit venue.\n\nWho is attending?\n\nThe G7 comprises the US, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain.

It is unclear if the rest of the G7 is ready to follow a tough US line.\n\nThe leaders are likely to issue a statement expressing concern on Chinese industrial overcapacity and will also look at the possibility of imposing additional measures to level the field with heavily subsidised Chinese companies.

Here are key facts and figures about the three-day event.\n\nWhere is the summit being held?\n\nThe meeting is being held in Borgo Egnazia in the southern region of Puglia - a luxury hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant. On the first evening, the leaders will attend a dinner in their honour in the nearby city of Brindisi. The media centre is in the city of Bari, 80 km (50 miles) from the summit venue.\n\nWho is coming?\n\nThe G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain. The European Union participates in all discussions and is represented by the presidents of both the European Council and the European Commission.\n\nThe host country traditionally invites outside guests to join some of the sessions. Italy has thrown open the doors and will this year welcome Pope Francis, the King of Jordan as well as the leaders of Ukraine, India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania, which holds the presidency of the African Union.\n\nIn addition, the secretary-general of the United Nations and heads of the World Bank, the IMF, the African Development Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will be present.\n\nWhat is on the agenda?\n\nThe summit is due to kick off at 11:00 a.m. (0900 GMT) on Thursday with a discussion about Africa, climate change and development. The conversation then switches to the Middle East before two sessions dedicated to Ukraine - the first including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nDay two has sessions on immigration, the Indo Pacific and economic security before the arrival in the afternoon of the outreach partners for talks on the Mediterranean, energy and Africa. Pope Francis will lead talks on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWhat are things to keep an eye on?\n\nMuch focus will be on whether the leaders can finally reach agreement on how to leverage profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the West and use them for Ukraine.\n\nU.S. officials also expect the G7 to send a tough warning next week to smaller Chinese banks to stop assisting Russia in evading Western sanctions.\n\nMore broadly, sources in Washington say the United States is poised to announce significant new sanctions against financial institutions and non-banks that are part of the \"technology and goods channels\" that supply the Russian military. It is unclear if the rest of the G7 is ready to follow a tough U.S. line.\n\nChina will also be discussed at length. The leaders are likely to issue a statement expressing concern on Chinese industrial overcapacity and will also look at the possibility of imposing additional measures to level the field with heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Again, the United States feels much more strongly about this than some EU nations.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to express their resolve in addressing the heavy debt burden faced by many emerging market and developing countries, but it is not clear what this commitment will mean in real terms.\n\nItaly is still pushing for an accord on a global minimum tax on multinationals, even if it said last month that a deal would not be finalised by June as previously planned.\n\nWhen does the summit end?\n\nOfficially the summit runs until June 15, but U.S. President Joe Biden is flying out on the night of June 14 and the only official item for Saturday, at present, is the closing news conference of host Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, plus a number of bilaterals for remaining leaders.",

Canada is set to host the G7 summit next year.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hosts this week's summit as the most stable of the alliance's European Union leaders, after her German and French counterparts were shaken by European parliamentary elections.\n\nThe results fortified Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy as the strongest party in the country, setting her up as a possible bridge-maker, if not kingmaker, in Europe.\n\nAs the host country, Italy is focusing the summit on defending the \"rules-based international system.\"\n\n\"Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine has undermined its principles and triggered growing instability, with multiple crises unfolding worldwide. The G7 will give equal importance to the conflict in the Middle East, with its consequences for the global agenda,\" the country's G7 website said.\n\nParis said he doesn't expect major news on the Israel-Hamas war from the leaders, though he noted real-time events unfolding in the Middle East may prompt the group to respond.\n\nThe G7 leaders put out a statement last week endorsing the peace plan unveiled by U.S. President Joe Biden that would include an immediate ceasefire, the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas and increased humanitarian assistance for Gazans.\n\nArguably the most anticipated outcome of the summit may be a decision on using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine.\n\nLast month, G7 finance ministers said they had moved toward agreement on a U.S. proposal to squeeze more money for Ukraine out of Russian assets frozen in their countries.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is pushing for an approach that would borrow against the future interest income from the frozen assets. It could give Ukraine as much as $50 billion immediately.\n\nBut the ministers left a final deal to be worked out ahead of the June summit of national leaders.\n\n\"I think, finally, the leaders themselves will make the long-awaited decision,\" Kirton said.\n\nParis said Ukraine is in need of three things: weapons, personnel and money. Canada, he said, is only able to help with one of those things.\n\n\"We're not going to be able to provide people, our weapons stocks are limited. So we need to be supporting Ukraine financially,\" he said.\n\nThe G7 summit will be followed by the Ukraine Peace Summit hosted by Switzerland.\n\nSwitzerland's president Viola Amherd said on Monday that nearly 90 countries and organizations, half of them from Europe, have confirmed their attendance.\n\nRussia will not attend the summit, which was organized at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nSwiss officials said the conference aims to set a course toward \"lasting peace\" in Ukraine, to reach a \"common understanding\" toward getting there and to draw up a road map for how to get both sides involved in talks.\n\nREAD ALSO: Pope to bring his call for ethical AI to G7 summit in southern Italy\n\nREAD ALSO: G7 leaders condemn Iran attack, say they stand in full

Key attendees include leaders from major democracies and special guests like Pope Francis. The agenda covers critical global issues such as climate change, the Ukraine conflict, and economic security. Significant focus will be on leveraging frozen Russian assets for Ukraine and addressing Chinese industrial practices.\n\nItaly hosts the annual summit of leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies from June 13-15. Here are key facts and figures about the three-day event. WHERE IS THE SUMMIT BEING HELD?\n\nThe meeting is being held in Borgo Egnazia in the southern region of Puglia - a luxury hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant. On the first evening, the leaders will attend a dinner in their honour in the nearby city of Brindisi. The media centre is in the city of Bari, 80 km (50 miles) from the summit venue. WHO IS COMING?\n\nThe G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain. The European Union participates in all discussions and is represented by the presidents of both the European Council and the European Commission. The host country traditionally invites outside guests to join some of the sessions. Italy has thrown open the doors and will this year welcome Pope Francis, the King of Jordan as well as the leaders of Ukraine, India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Algeria and Mauritania, which holds the presidency of the African Union.\n\nIn addition, the secretary-general of the United Nations and heads of the World Bank and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe will be present. WHAT IS ON THE AGENDA?\n\nThe summit is due to kick off at 11:00 a.m (0900 GMT) on Thursday with a discussion about Africa, climate change and development. The conversation then switches to the Middle East before two sessions dedicated to Ukraine - the first including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Day two has sessions on immigration, the Indo Pacific and economic security before the arrival in the afternoon of the outreach partners for talks on the Mediterranean, energy and Africa. Pope Francis will lead talks on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWHAT ARE THINGS TO KEEP AN EYE ON? Much focus will be on whether the leaders can finally reach agreement on how to leverage profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the West and use them for Ukraine.\n\nU.S. officials also expect the G7 to send a tough warning next week to smaller Chinese banks to stop assisting Russia in evading Western sanctions. More broadly, sources in Washington say the United States is poised to announce significant new sanctions against financial institutions and non-banks that are part of the \"technology and goods channels\" that supply the Russian military. It is unclear if the rest of the G7 is ready to follow a tough U.S. line.\n\nChina will also be discussed at length. The leaders are likely to issue a statement expressing concern on Chinese industrial overcapacity and will also look at the possibility of imposing additional measures to level the field with heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Again, the United States feels much more strongly about this than some EU nations. The G7 leaders are likely to express their resolve in addressing the heavy debt burden faced by many emerging market and developing countries, but it is not clear what this commitment will mean in real terms.\n\nItaly is still pushing for an accord on a global minimum tax on multinationals, even if it said last month that a deal would not be finalised by June as previously planned. WHEN DOES THE SUMMIT END?\n\nOfficially the summit runs until June 15, but U.S. President Joe Biden is flying out on the night of June 14 and the only official item for Saturday, at present, is the closing news conference of host Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, plus a number of bilaterals for remaining leaders.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated

Alex Brandon/Associated Press\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- A Group of Seven summit opened Thursday with an agreement reached on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support, even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nPresident Biden said the agreement to tap into the windfall profits on some $280 billion in frozen Russian assets held in Europe would put that money to work for Ukraine.\n\n\"Another reminder to (Vladimir) Putin: We're not backing down. In fact, we're standing together against this illegal aggression,\" Biden said at an evening news conference, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by his side.\n\nThe agreement was hashed out hours before Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni opened the summit at a luxury resort in southern Italy, saying she wanted the message of the meeting to be one of dialogue with the global south and unity.\n\nShe compared the G7 to the ancient olive trees that are a symbol of the Puglia region, \"with their solid roots, and branches projected toward the future.\"\n\nBeyond discussing Ukraine, the war in Gaza and China's industrial policy, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but he is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied - to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nAlong with Zelensky, other guests included Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, freshly reelected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron also facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFROZEN RUSSIAN ASSETS TO SUPPORT UKRAINE\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\n\"It is a strong signal that we are sending to Ukraine that we will support Ukraine in its fight for freedom for as long as it takes,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"It is also a strong signal to Putin that Putin cannot outlast us,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA French official said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen - for example, when the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelensky listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. and Japan.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds ($310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEUROPE'S NEW POLITICAL CHESSBOARD\n\nMeloni went into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nMeloni didn't hesitate to flex her far-right muscles in the opening sessions: Italian negotiators successfully removed the word \"abortion\" from the G7 final communique. However, the text does reaffirm commitments made at last year's G7, where abortion rights were specified, according to a draft seen by the ANSA news agency.\n\n\"I regret this,\" Macron said about the text, answering the question of an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit. He recalled that France had included a woman's right to abortion in its constitution and that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men.\"\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" he said. \"I regret it, but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\" he told the Italian reporter.\n\nMeloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has insisted that she won't roll back abortion rights in Italy, where they have been legal since 1978, but the center-left opposition worries she is slowly chipping away at them.\n\nIT'S HAPPENING WHERE?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nWinfield reported from Bari, Italy.

Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nAlso Read | Italy hosts G7 Summit: Why was the grouping created and what's on the agenda this year?\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine The US proposal involves engineering a USD 50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million Euros or USD 310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nAlso Read | Biden and Zelenskyy will sign security agreement between US and Ukraine when they meet at G7\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAlso Read | C Raja Mohan on PM's first trip abroad in Modi 3.0: A chance to reboot relations with the West\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting.\n\nOne group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and

FAQs", "body": "Italy hosts the annual summit of leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies on June 13-15. During the summit, top leaders from the economically rich nations including US President Joe Biden and others are due to meet. While, India, is not an official member of the G7 nations, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni invited her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to attend the grand event. Here are key facts and figures about the three-day event.\n\nIn 1975, leaders of the world's wealthy democracies gathered to deal with an energy crisis sparked by a war and rampant inflation. Those same sore points are bedeviling their successors representing 46% of the global economy at this week's Group of Seven summit, with high consumer and energy prices threatening to trigger recessions in the US and Europe.\n\nHere are key facts about the Group of Seven:\n\nIt's a group of wealthy democracies with large, advanced economies and high standards of living. Annual summits give leaders a chance to hash out common approaches on pretty much anything they want to talk about. The first summits in the 1970s were convened to deal with the first post-World War II recession and focused on fiscal stimulus and exchange rates. Economic policy still tends to be front and centre. Energy, terrorism, the Cold War and the environment have been major themes across the group's history. The members are: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. European Union officials also attend.\n\nIn 1975, French President Valery Giscard D'Estaing formally convened what was then a Group of Six outside Paris. The purpose: to deal with a recession accompanied by high unemployment and inflation in the wake of the Arab oil embargo against the US and other countries for supporting Israel during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Canada was invited the next year. Their annual meetings offer leaders a chance to size each other up and negotiate face-to-face on a broad spectrum of issues involving all their Cabinet departments - the big picture.\n\nThe meeting is being held in Borgo Egnazia in the southern region of Puglia - a luxury hotel with a Michelin-starred restaurant. On the first evening, the leaders will attend a dinner in their honour in the nearby city of Brindisi.\n\nThe G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain. The European Union participates in all discussions and is represented by the presidents of both the European Council and the European Commission. The host country traditionally invites outside guests to join some of the sessions. Italy has thrown open the doors and will this year welcome Pope Francis, the King of Jordan as well as the leaders of Ukraine, India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania, which holds the presidency of the African Union.\n\nIn addition, the secretary-general of the United Nations and heads of the World Bank, the IMF, the African Development Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will be present.\n\nThe summit kicked off at 11:15 a.m. (0915 GMT) on Thursday with a discussion about Africa, climate change and development. The conversation then switches to the Middle East before two sessions dedicated to Ukraine - the first including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nDay two has sessions on immigration, the Indo-Pacific and economic security before the arrival in the afternoon of the outreach partners for talks on the Mediterranean, energy and Africa. Pope Francis will lead talks on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nMuch focus will be on whether the leaders can finally reach agreement on how to leverage profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the West and use them for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new security agreement with Ukraine on the sidelines of the gathering.\n\nChina will also be discussed at length. The leaders are likely to issue a statement expressing concern on Chinese industrial overcapacity and will also look at the possibility of imposing additional measures to level the field with heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Again, the United States feels much more strongly about this than some EU nations. US officials also expect the G7 to send a tough warning to smaller Chinese banks to stop assisting Russia in evading Western sanctions.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to express their resolve in addressing the heavy debt burden faced by many emerging markets and developing countries, but it is not clear what this commitment will mean in real terms. Italy is still pushing for an accord on a global minimum tax on multinationals, even if it said last month that a deal would not be finalised by June as previously planned.\n\nIndia on Wednesday reiterated that the best option to resolve the Ukraine conflict is dialogue and diplomacy as Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels to Italy to attend the annual summit of G7 grouping that is set to focus on dealing with global geopolitical turmoil.\n\nModi, accompanied by a high-level delegation, will travel to Italy on Thursday to attend an outreach session at the summit on June 14. It will be his first trip abroad after assuming charge as prime minister for the third term. \"We have always maintained that dialogue and diplomacy is the best option,\" Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said at a media briefing when asked what would be India's approach to resolving the Ukraine conflict.\n\nBiden and Prime Minister Modi would likely \"have the opportunity to encounter one another\" on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy, National Security Advisor (NSA) Jake Sullivan said here Wednesday. \"He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. During a press conference in New Delhi, the Foreign Secretary also did not reveal any bilateral scheduled with Biden but also did not rule out the possibility.\n\nKwatra said Modi is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni. \"In the meeting, the two prime ministers are expected to review the entire gamut of bilateral ties and give directions for next steps,\" he said. Modi is also likely to have bilateral meetings with some other leaders. Asked whether the prime minister will hold any bilateral meeting with Zelenskyy, Kwatra did not give a direct reply and said Modi's schedule is in the works. Modi had attended the previous G7 summit in Hiroshima in May last year.\n\nOfficially the summit runs until June 15, but US President Joe Biden is flying out on the night of June 14 and the only official item for Saturday, at present, is the closing news conference of host Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, plus several bilaterals for remaining leaders.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)",

He\u00b4ll be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied - to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nFrom left, European Council President Charles Michel, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, U.S. President Joe Biden, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stand for a group photo at the G7, Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Borgo Egnazia, Italy. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWith President Joe Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron also facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia\u00b4s frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\n\"It is a strong signal that we are sending to Ukraine that we will support Ukraine in its fight for freedom for as long as it takes,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"It is also a strong signal to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that Putin cannot outlast us,\" she said.\n\nA French official said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen - for example, when the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements he hoped to see finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. and Japan.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds ($310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia\u00b4s military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMeloni went into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy\u00b4s first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7\u00b4s two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nMeloni didn't hesitate to flex her far-right muscles in the opening sessions: Italian negotiators successfully removed the word abortion from the G7 final communique. The text however does reaffirm commitments made at last year's G7, where abortion rights were specified, according to a draft seen by the ANSA news agency.\n\n\"I regret this,\" Macron said about the text, answering the question of an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit. He recalled that France had included a women's right to abortion in its Constitution, and that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men.\"\n\n\"It\u00b4s not a vision that\u00b4s shared across all the political spectrum,\" he said. \"I regret it, but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\" he told the Italian reporter.\n\nMeloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has insisted that she won't roll back abortion rights in Italy, where they have been legal since 1978, but the center-left opposition worries she is slowly chipping away at them.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers while also emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries on Friday as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in daily life: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that\u00b4s something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia\u00b4s medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi\u00b4s port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nWinfield reported from Bari, Italy.

In fact, we're standing together against this illegal aggression,\" Biden said at an evening news conference, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by his side.\n\nThe agreement was hashed out hours before Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni opened the summit at a luxury resort in southern Italy, saying she wanted the message of the meeting to be one of dialogue with the global south and unity.\n\nShe compared the G7 to the ancient olive trees that are a symbol of the Puglia region, \"with their solid roots, and branches projected toward the future.\"\n\nBeyond discussing Ukraine, the war in Gaza and China's industrial policy, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering. He'll be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied - to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nAlong with Zelenskyy, other guests included Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron also facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\n\"It is a strong signal that we are sending to Ukraine that we will support Ukraine in its fight for freedom for as long as it takes,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"It is also a strong signal to Putin that Putin cannot outlast us,\" she said.\n\nA French official said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen - for example, when the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. and Japan.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds ($310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni went into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nMeloni didn't hesitate to flex her far-right muscles in the opening sessions: Italian negotiators successfully removed the word abortion from the G7 final communique. The text however does reaffirm commitments made at last year's G7, where abortion rights were specified, according to a draft seen by the ANSA news agency.\n\n\"I regret this,\" Macron said about the text, answering the question of an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit. He recalled that France had included a women's right to abortion in its Constitution, and that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men.\"\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" he said. \"I regret it, but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\" he told the Italian reporter.\n\nMeloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has insisted that she won't roll back abortion rights in Italy, where they have been legal since 1978, but the center-left opposition worries she is slowly chipping away at them.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colleen_long@detroitnews.com", "name": "Colleen Long", "type": "author",

Here are key facts and figures about the three-day event.\n\nWHERE IS THE SUMMIT BEING HELD?\n\nThe meeting is being held in Borgo Egnazia in the southern region of Puglia - a luxury hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant. On the first evening, the leaders will attend a dinner in their honour in the nearby city of Brindisi. The media centre is in the city of Bari, 80 km (50 miles) from the summit venue.\n\nWHO IS COMING?\n\nThe G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain. The European Union participates in all discussions and is represented by the presidents of both the European Council and the European Commission.\n\nThe host country traditionally invites outside guests to join some of the sessions. Italy has thrown open the doors and will this year welcome Pope Francis, the King of Jordan as well as the leaders of Ukraine, India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Algeria and Mauritania, which holds the presidency of the African Union.\n\nIn addition, the secretary-general of the United Nations and heads of the World Bank, the IMF, the African Development Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will be present.\n\nWHAT IS ON THE AGENDA?\n\nThe summit is due to kick off at 11:00 a.m (0900 GMT) on Thursday with a discussion about Africa, climate change and development. The conversation then switches to the Middle East before two sessions dedicated to Ukraine - the first including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nDay two has sessions on immigration, the Indo Pacific and economic security before the arrival in the afternoon of the outreach partners for talks on the Mediterranean, energy and Africa. Pope Francis will lead talks on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWHAT ARE THINGS TO KEEP AN EYE ON?\n\nMuch focus will be on whether the leaders can finally reach agreement on how to leverage profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the West and use them for Ukraine.\n\nU.S. officials also expect the G7 to send a tough warning next week to smaller Chinese banks to stop assisting Russia in evading Western sanctions.\n\nMore broadly, sources in Washington say the United States is poised to announce significant new sanctions against financial institutions and non-banks that are part of the \"technology and goods channels\" that supply the Russian military. It is unclear if the rest of the G7 is ready to follow a tough U.S. line.\n\nChina will also be discussed at length. The leaders are likely to issue a statement expressing concern on Chinese industrial overcapacity and will also look at the possibility of imposing additional measures to level the field with heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Again, the United States feels much more strongly about this than some EU nations.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to express their resolve in addressing the heavy debt burden faced by many emerging market and developing countries, but it is not clear what this commitment will mean in real terms.\n\nItaly is still pushing for an accord on a global minimum tax on multinationals, even if it said last month that a deal would not be finalised by June as previously planned.\n\nWHEN DOES THE SUMMIT END?\n\nOfficially the summit runs until June 15, but U.S. President Joe Biden is flying out on the night of June 14 and the only official item for Saturday, at present, is the closing news conference of host Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, plus a number of bilaterals for remaining leaders.",

PM Modi will hold bilateral talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, continuing their dialogue from her visit to India in March 2023. He will also participate in an Outreach Session on June 14, addressing Artificial Intelligence, Energy, and regional issues in Africa and the Mediterranean.Additionally, PM Modi's involvement in the G7 summit will allow him to follow up on the outcomes of the G20 summit hosted by India last year, and India will also participate in the Ukraine Peace summit in Switzerland at a later date.\n\nThis high-profile event brings together leaders from seven of the world's major democracies which includes the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Britain to discuss and address critical global issues.\n\nHere's a detailed look at the summit's location, participants, and key agenda items for this year.\n\nWhere is the G7 summit being held?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place at Borgo Egnazia, a luxury resort in southern Italy's Puglia region. The venue boasts a Michelin-starred restaurant and scenic views, making it an ideal location for the gathering. Additionally, a special dinner in honor of the leaders will be held in the nearby city of Brindisi, while the media center is set up in Bari, approximately 80 kilometers from the summit venue.\n\nWho is attending the G7 summit?\n\nThe G7 consists of the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The European Union also participates in all discussions, represented by the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission. This year, Italy has extended invitations to several outside guests, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pope Francis, US President Joe Biden, King of Jordan and leaders from Ukraine, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, the UAE, Kenya, Algeria, Tunisia, and Mauritania along with heads of the United Nations, World Bank, IMF, African Development Bank, and OECD.\n\nWhat is on the G7 Agenda?\n\nAfrica, Climate change, and development\n\nClimate change remains a critical issue for the G7, as none of its member nations are currently on track to meet their 2030 emission reduction targets. Although the G7 aims for a 40-42% reduction in emissions by 2030, current policies suggest that only a 19-33% reduction is achievable. This significant shortfall underscores the urgent need for stronger leadership from these affluent nations, which are collectively responsible for a substantial portion of global emissions. The summit will focus on reinforcing commitments and exploring innovative strategies to meet climate goals, with an emphasis on phasing out coal-fired power plants by the mid-2030s to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources.\n\nAfrica is a top priority for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the host of the G7 summit. She aims to establish Italy as a crucial clean-energy bridge between the European Union and Africa, thereby decreasing reliance on Russian gas. Central to her foreign policy is the Mattei plan, which focuses on substantial investments in African infrastructure, development, and energy sectors.\n\nIsrael-Gaza conflict\n\nThe G7 will emphasize resolving the Middle East conflict, particularly the Gaza crisis. US President Joe Biden has proposed an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the release of hostages, increased humanitarian aid for Gaza, and a comprehensive peace agreement to ensure the security of both Israelis and Gazans. This proposal, already supported by G7 countries and members of the United Nations Security Council, underscores the urgency of addressing the conflict due to domestic and international pressure, the need to prevent the conflict from spilling over into neighboring oil-rich regions, and the imperative to avoid collateral damage, such as attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Addressing these issues is critical to mitigating the immediate impacts and fostering long-term stability in the region.\n\nUkraine conflict\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine is a central concern for the Group of Seven (G7) nations, particularly for the four European member states. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be actively involved in discussions, pressing for increased support from Western allies.\n\nThe G7 leaders are working to finalize a plan to utilize profits from the interest on \u20ac300 billion of frozen Russian central bank assets to support Kyiv. This proposal aims to leverage these profits as collateral for a loan of up to $50 billion. However, complexities surrounding debt issuance and the potential unfreezing of assets in a peace scenario remain contentious points that need resolution.\n\nMigration\n\nManaging migration and supporting displaced populations. Discussions will cover policy coordination on migration, providing humanitarian aid, and enhancing border security to manage migration flows effectively.\n\nIndo-Pacific and economic security\n\nStrengthening economic ties and addressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. The agenda includes ensuring trade security, building regional partnerships, and countering the influence of China to bolster economic and security stability in the region.\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Energy, and Africa-Mediterranean\n\nEthical use of AI, sustainable energy, and regional development. The talks will focus on establishing governance for AI technologies, promoting energy transitions, and supporting development and cooperation in the Africa-Mediterranean region.\n\nChina's industrial policy\n\nAddressing economic practices and challenges posed by China. The discussion will highlight concerns over China's industrial overcapacity, discuss measures to level the playing field, and consider potential sanctions to counter heavily subsidized Chinese companies.\n\nAddressing global debt\n\nManaging debt in emerging and developing countries. The agenda will include developing strategies for debt relief and enhancing financial stability to support economic growth in debt-burdened nations.\n\nGlobal minimum tax\n\nEnsuring fair taxation for multinational corporations. The discussions will aim to finalize agreements on a global minimum tax and ensure fair tax practices to prevent tax evasion and promote economic equity.\n\nWhen does the summit end?\n\nThe G7 summit concludes on June 15, with US President Joe Biden departing on the evening of June 14. The final day includes bilateral meetings and a closing press conference by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, summarizing the summit's outcomes and future commitments.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied -- to press Mr. Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr. Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nPM Modi flying to Italy for G7 to 'salvage diminished image': Jairam Ramesh\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements he hoped to see finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMr. Sunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMr. Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Mr. Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office's customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being addressed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Mr. Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,'\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Mr. Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in daily life: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting.

This is happening at a delicate moment, as conflicts continue in Ukraine and Gaza and with elections coming up for President Biden, President Macron and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe G7 is a group of the world's seven largest 'advanced' economies -- countries that play a dominant role in world trade financce. The members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan the UK and the US.\n\nIn 1998, Russia joined the grouping, which effectively it the G8. But the country was excluded in 2014 because of its action of taking over Crimea. China has never been a member, even though it has a large economy and the world's second-largest population. Its lower wealth per person means it is not considered an advanced economy like the G7 countries.\n\nChina and Russia are both part of the G20, which includes both developed and developing countries. The EU is not a G7 member, but attends the annual summit. In the course of the year, G7 ministers and officials meet to agree on, and release, joint statements on world issues.\n\nThe 2024 G7 summit, the 50, is scheduled to take place in Apulia, Italy, from June 13 to June15. Apulia, also known as the Puglia region, is located in the southern part of Italy. The meeting will take place at Borgo Egnazia, a luxury hotel in the southern Puglia region. This hotel features a restaurant with a Michelin star -- a star awarded by the Michelin Guide, a prestigious rating system for exceptional dining experiences.\n\nThis will be the first big international event hosted by Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, since she took office in October 2022.\n\nIt is a custom for the host country to invite guests to join some sessions. This year, the summit is likely to see Pope Francis, the King of Jordan and leaders from India, Ukraine, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Kenya, Algeria, Tunisia, the UAE, and Mauritania, which holds the African Union presidency.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General will also attend, along with leaders of the World Bank, IMF, African Development Bank and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nPrime Minister Modi will travel to Italy for the G7 summit, marking his first international trip after being elected for a third consecutive term. PTI quoted sources as saying that PM Modi would depart for Italy on June 13 and attend the summit session on June 14. He will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra and NSA Ajit Doval.\n\nPrior to the visit, Kwatra, while addressing the media, reiterated India's unwavering position that diplomacy and dialogue were crucial for resolving the Ukrainian crisis. He reminded the media of Modi's statement in September 2022, where the prime minister had famously said, \"Today's era is not of war.\" The fallout of the war -- including supply disruptions of food, fuel and fertilizer, would pose difficulties for global supply chains and the world's overall economic instability.\n\nSince 2003, India has taken part in ten Outreach Sessions of the grouping. These sessions have been hosted in different countries like France, the UK, Russia, Germany, Japan, and Italy. The most recent ones were in Germany (2022) and Japan (2023). Each time, the Indian Prime Minister has attended, showing how seriously India takes these summits.\n\nApart from PM Modi, other world leaders who are expected to attend the summit are US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to take part in a discussion on June 12 about Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, which has now lasted three years. During this event, he will once again urge Western allies to provide more support.\n\nThe G7 nations have already placed the largest set of sanctions ever on Russia's economy. They have restricted Russia from international trade and the global financial system. Additionally, they have frozen around $300 billion (approximately \u00a3236 billion, or INR 25 lakh crore) of Russian assets, including the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central banks, held in their countries.\n\nThe G7 countries are reportedly planning to transfer the interest earned from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine as a loan, which could total $50 billion (approximately INR 4.15 lakh crore). On June 3, the G7 leaders supported a plan by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza. His proposal includes an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, more aid for Gaza and a peace agreement ensuring the security of Israel and the safety of Gaza's residents.\n\nUS officials anticipate a strong G7 warning in the coming week to smaller Chinese banks asking them to halt aid to Russia for avoiding Western sanctions. In addition, sources in Washington say the US is set to announce major new sanctions against financial institutions and other entities involved in supplying technology and goods to the Russian military. It is not clear if the rest of the G7 will support this tough stance.\n\nChina will also be a major topic of discussion. The leaders are likely to release a statement showing concern about China's industrial over-production and may consider new measures to compete with heavily subsidized Chinese companies.\n\nItaly's government has said its relationships with developing and emerging economies will be a key focus at the forthcoming G7 summit. They want to build partnerships that are mutually beneficial. Italy is inviting leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region to attend the summit -- including India, China, Japan and Brazil.\n\nItaly has also created a programme, called the Mattei Plan, which will provide 5.5 billion Euros in grants and loans to several African countries to help develop their economies. The overall message is that Italy is prioritizing cooperation and support for developing nations as part of the G7 summit agenda. The plan aims to make Italy an energy hub by constructing gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe.\n\nHowever, some people think this might be an excuse for Italy to tighten its control on migration from Africa. Italy is requesting financial support from other countries for the project.\n\nAs the G7 president in 2023, Japan encouraged the group to create a plan for international economic security. The G7 agreed on an anti-coercion pact to prevent such countries as China and Russia from using their economic power to influence others. In December 2023, Italy decided to leave China's 'Belt and Road Initiative', which aims to expand ports and transport routes around the world to increase trade.\n\nMeloni called joining the initiative 'a serious mistake', while the US has criticized it as a form of 'debt-trap diplomacy' by China. It is believed that the US wants G7 leaders to focus more on economic security at the forthcoming summit.\n\nAt the 2023 summit in Japan, AI safety was a key topic, leading to the Hiroshima AI Process, which aims to ensure 'safe, secure and trustworthy AI worldwide'. However, these were only voluntary measures. The G7 summit may consider creating more international regulations for AI safety, building on the AI Act from the EU and the US President's executive order on AI.\n\nThe G7 cannot make laws, but its decisions can have worldwide impacts. For instance, in 2002, the G7 was key to creating a global fund to combat malaria and AIDS. Before the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministers agreed to increase taxes on multinational companies. The grouping has also granted financial help to developing countries and ensured actions addressing climate change.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia

The technical details will be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters.\n\nThe source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year. A senior US official said the United States had agreed to provide up to $50bn itself, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state -- a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations -- the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada -- face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority.\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed US efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.In addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year. Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote. All smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya. Although the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Other leaders attending the G7 summit are French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nIn an election year, the G7 summit holds significant importance for President Biden. As with his recent trip to France, he is expected to use the occasion to stress the importance of alliances.\n\nOn June 14, President Biden will meet with Pope Francis, according to the White House. The Vatican confirmed in April that the Pope will join the leaders' summit, participating in a special session on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\"This is the first time in history that a pontiff will participate in the work of a G7,\" Ms. Meloni said on April 26.\n\nWorld leaders expect to discuss a wide range of issues during the group's 50th summit, including a roadmap to unlock frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine. During the summit, there will also be a session on the Middle East, where leaders will get an update from President Biden on the negotiations with respect to the cease-fire and hostage deal.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to announce a plan for unlocking frozen Russian sovereign assets to assist Ukraine, an initiative that the United States has championed for a while.\n\n\"There's been very good progress in the discussions among the G7 delegations here to reach an agreement on how to make that happen,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on June 13.\n\n\"And hopefully, by the time the leaders meet today, we will have a common vision for the way forward. And the Italian presidency will be able to announce that there is a path forward. But we'll all just have to wait and see what happens here in a few hours time.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the crucial summit, the G7 finance ministers held discussions about the legality of using some $300 billion worth of frozen assets kept in European accounts as collateral for providing a loan to Ukraine for reconstruction. France was believed to be the main holdout on the plan.\n\nPresident Biden mentioned before leaving France last week that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Macron on a plan to use the frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe proposal under discussion involves using the profits from the assets, specifically the interest earned, as collateral to provide Ukraine with a loan through a sovereign lender. Italy will capture the spotlight this week if the G7 leaders can agree on the details of this proposal.\n\n\"This has been something that the United States has put a lot of energy and effort into because we see the proceeds from these assets as being a valuable source of resources for Ukraine,\" Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nFollowing his meetings with G7 leaders on June 13, President Biden will sign a 10-year bilateral security agreement with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, signifying a continuing U.S. commitment to support the war-torn country against Russian aggression.\n\nThe security pact comes after President Biden and the leaders of the G7 countries agreed last year at the NATO summit in Vilnius that they would each sign bilateral security agreements with Ukraine.\n\nSo far, 15 countries have already entered into direct bilateral security agreements with Ukraine, according to the White House.\n\nMr. Sullivan briefed reporters ahead of the bilateral meeting, describing the agreement as a milestone moment.\n\n\"We think this is a big deal, a milestone moment in the partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine,\" Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nHe added that the agreement is \"a real marker\" of U.S. commitment for the long term \"both in defending against Russian aggression and in deterring future aggression so that Ukraine can be a sovereign, viable, thriving democracy.\"\n\nThe security agreement, however, doesn't include any commitment to use U.S. forces to defend Ukraine.\n\nMr. Sullivan declined to confirm if the United States will send another Patriot missile system to Ukraine, saying that an announcement would not be made during the Biden-Zelenskyy meeting.\n\nPresident Biden reportedly approved sending the Patriot missile system to Ukraine in response to Kyiv's desperate demand for additional air defenses as it confronts an intensive Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nThe decision, which was first reported by The New York Times, has not been publicly announced.\n\nAccording to Mr. Sullivan, the security agreement does not include specific dollar figures for supporting Ukraine.\n\n\"It includes a commitment to work with Congress on sustainable funding going forward, which we will do,\" he told reporters on June 12 on Air Force One en route to Italy.\n\n\"And it lays out a framework for how we work with Ukraine and with other allies and partners to ensure Ukraine has what it needs in terms of the physical capacity as well as the intelligence and other capacities to be able to defend itself effectively and to deter Russia.\"\n\nThe president will meet with Mr. Zelenskyy for the second time in a week. The two leaders met in Paris on June 7 during the commemorations of the 80th anniversary of D-Day.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Leaders of the seven nations meet annually to collaborate on shared goals.\n\nAdditionally, the president of the European Council and the president of the European Commission, representing the European Union, will attend. Representatives from various states and international organizations, invited by the host nation, Italy, will also participate in the sessions.\n\nThis year's discussions will focus on six themes: Africa, climate change and development, the Middle East, Ukraine, migration, the Indo-Pacific, and economic security.\n\nAmong Canada's top priorities at the summit will be the clean energy transition, fighting misinformation and foreign interference, and advancing artificial intelligence. Mr. Trudeau is expected to hold bilateral meetings with other world leaders.\n\nCanada is scheduled to host the G7 summit next year.\n\nAs this year's host country, Italy is focusing the summit on defending the \"rules-based international system.\"\n\n\"Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine has undermined its principles and triggered growing instability, with multiple crises unfolding worldwide,\" Italy said on its G7 website. It added that equal importance will be given to the conflict in the Middle East and its consequences for the world.\n\nOne of the most anticipated outcomes of the summit may be a decision on using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. Last month, G7 finance ministers announced progress toward agreeing on a U.S. proposal to allocate more funds for Ukraine from Russian assets frozen in their countries.\n\nThe G7 summit will be followed by the Ukraine Peace Summit hosted by Switzerland.\n\nSwitzerland's president Viola Amherd said June 10 that nearly 90 countries and organizations, half of them from Europe, have confirmed their attendance.\n\nRussia will not attend the summit, which was organized at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

This will be a loan syndicate. We're going to share the risk, because we have a shared commitment to get this done,' the official said.\n\nHe would not say how much other G7 countries would contribute, beyond saying that the final summit statement in Puglia would speak of 'loans plural'.\n\nThe G7 countries -- which count the European Union as their unofficial eighth member -- have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\n'Today the G7 in Bari will show unity. Unity for Ukraine's freedom,' European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen wrote earlier on X.\n\nGermany's finance minister, Christian Lindner, added: 'Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine.'\n\nHe said it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin our 'unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets' -- but confirmed the details still needed working out.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron's office has also said there was agreement, without providing details.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nZelensky said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 and the EU have frozen some 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian assets, much of it frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organisation based in Belgium.\n\nEU countries say they could generate between 2.5 and 3.0 billion euros per year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest.\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux. Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort, and took a selfie with reporters.\n\nBut she had a serious message.\n\n'The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardise our freedom and our democracy,' she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called 'industrial overcapacity', particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

outline deal on Thursday to provide $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\n\nThe political agreement was the centrepiece of the opening day in southern Italy of the annual summit of G7 leaders, attended for a second successive year by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader will sign a new, long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden on Thursday, as well as one with fellow G7 member Japan.\n\nMany of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they also seek to counter China's economic ambitions.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days, we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nThe G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300bn of impounded Russian funds.\n\nThe technical details will be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters.\n\nThe source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year.\n\nA senior US official said the United States had agreed to provide up to $50bn itself, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state -- a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations -- the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada -- face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority.\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed US efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year.\n\nBiden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.", "source": {"uri":

Here are key facts and figures about the three-day event.\n\nWHERE IS THE SUMMIT BEING HELD?\n\nThe meeting is being held in Borgo Egnazia in the southern region of Puglia - a luxury hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant. On the first evening, the leaders will attend a dinner in their honour in the nearby city of Brindisi. The media centre is in the city of Bari, 80 km (50 miles) from the summit venue.\n\nWHO IS COMING?\n\nThe G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain. The European Union participates in all discussions and is represented by the presidents of both the European Council and the European Commission.\n\nThe host country traditionally invites outside guests to join some of the sessions. Italy has thrown open the doors and will this year welcome Pope Francis, the King of Jordan as well as the leaders of Ukraine, India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Algeria and Mauritania, which holds the presidency of the African Union.\n\nIn addition, the secretary-general of the United Nations and heads of the World Bank and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe will be present.\n\nWHAT IS ON THE AGENDA?\n\nThe summit is due to kick off at 11:00 a.m (0900 GMT) on Thursday with a discussion about Africa, climate change and development. The conversation then switches to the Middle East before two sessions dedicated to Ukraine - the first including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nDay two has sessions on immigration, the Indo Pacific and economic security before the arrival in the afternoon of the outreach partners for talks on the Mediterranean, energy and Africa. Pope Francis will lead talks on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWHAT ARE THINGS TO KEEP AN EYE ON?\n\nMuch focus will be on whether the leaders can finally reach agreement on how to leverage profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the West and use them for Ukraine.\n\nU.S. officials also expect the G7 to send a tough warning next week to smaller Chinese banks to stop assisting Russia in evading Western sanctions.\n\nMore broadly, sources in Washington say the United States is poised to announce significant new sanctions against financial institutions and non-banks that are part of the \"technology and goods channels\" that supply the Russian military. It is unclear if the rest of the G7 is ready to follow a tough U.S. line.\n\nChina will also be discussed at length. The leaders are likely to issue a statement expressing concern on Chinese industrial overcapacity and will also look at the possibility of imposing additional measures to level the field with heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Again, the United States feels much more strongly about this than some EU nations.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to express their resolve in addressing the heavy debt burden faced by many emerging market and developing countries, but it is not clear what this commitment will mean in real terms.\n\nItaly is still pushing for an accord on a global minimum tax on multinationals, even if it said last month that a deal would not be finalised by June as previously planned.\n\nWHEN DOES THE SUMMIT END?\n\nOfficially the summit runs until June 15, but U.S. President Joe Biden is flying out on the night of June 14 and the only official item for Saturday, at present, is the closing news conference of host Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, plus a number of bilaterals for remaining leaders.\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Andrea Shalal and Andreas Rinke; Editing by Christina Fincher)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"},

Ukrainian President Zelenskiy announced additional investments from Japan and anticipated an accord with the U.S. Despite domestic struggles, G7 leaders aim to counter China's economic influence and support African economies.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies agreed an outline deal on Thursday to provide $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow invaded its neighbour in 2022. The political agreement was the centrepiece of the opening day in southern Italy of the annual summit of G7 leaders, attended for a second successive year by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nHe said he had signed a 10-year security accord with Japan on the sidelines of the summit and that Japan would provide Ukraine with $4.5 billion this year. Zelenskiy will also sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden later in the day. The G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300 billion of impounded Russian funds.\n\nThe technical details are to be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters. The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year. The United States had agreed to provide up to $50 billion itself, a senior U.S. official said, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November's election, according to a person close to the talks. Russia regards attempts by the West to take income from its frozen assets as criminal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday, adding that Moscow's response would be very painful for the European Union.\n\nSTRUGGLES AT HOME Many of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they also seek to counter China's economic ambitions.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia. While Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European parliament elections, leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that may undermine their authority.\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit. In addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said. The G7 may have a very different complexion next year.\n\nBiden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power in a national election next month, while French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote. All smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing Mediterranean sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nThe G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence. Among those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers around the world such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.

The source, who is not being named because they are not authorized to discuss details publicly, says G7 leaders are finalizing details of the loan. Leaders of the G7 countries have agreed to engineer a US$50-billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral. The news comes on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit taking place in Apulia, Italy. The three-day summit is an opportunity for collaboration among the leaders of the wealthy democracies - France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan. Ukraine is expected to be a major agenda item for the leaders as the U.S. pushes to reach an agreement on Russian assets. Prime Minister Trudeau is scheduled to have meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He is also set to participate in working sessions with other leaders on collaboration with Africa, climate change, the Middle East and Ukraine.

Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy now finds itself in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the other two EU members, Germany and France, are not faring as well, shaken by the strong showings of far-right parties in the vote. Macron called early elections and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw its Social Democrats finish behind the traditional conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni will likely be able to steer the three-day meeting toward its main priority points while strengthening its role on the world stage, analysts say. A sign of his far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language on abortion access in the final communiqu\u00e9.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with standard Macron cabinet practice, said there were differences of views with Italian negotiators on some issues, including sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was on the agenda but said discussions were continuing.\n\nWhile the recent results are unlikely to radically change the direction of the next G7 summit, this electoral victory provides Prime Minister Meloni with additional leverage to make it a predominantly Mediterranean summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, Director Deputy of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThis includes promoting his migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage his agenda for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for a international treaty ensuring that AI is developed and used ethically, recognizing the promise it offers but highlighting the serious and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe will carry this campaign to the industrialized countries of the world while wars rage on several fronts. One of his biggest concerns is the use of AI in the arms sector. But Francis also worries about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in everyday life: a technology that could determine the trustworthiness of a mortgage applicant, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the risk of recidivism of a person already convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that resembles a theater set, a fake town designed to look like one of Puglia's white-stone medieval hamlets, but which actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to a real archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a square with a clock tower. A favorite of celebrities, it was closed to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodation awaits the more than 2,000 police and carabinieri who have been dispatched to provide security. Authorities sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship sheltering them in the port of Brindisis on Wednesday after the police union complained about unacceptable hygiene conditions on board.\n\nAs throughout the G7, a range of anti-globalization, anti-war and climate activists are organizing protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. A group is organizing a dinner for the poor on Friday evening calling for peace, people's rights and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\n\n___\n\nNicole Winfield reported from Bari.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean KilpatrickSAVELLETRI DI FASANO, Italy - Canada will contribute $5 billion toward a loan to Ukraine that will be based on future revenue from frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Thursday in Italy. Leaders of the G7 countries have agreed to engineer a US$50-billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders. It would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral. The long-awaited decision came on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit taking place in Apulia, Italy. The three-day summit is an opportunity for collaboration among the leaders of the wealthy democracies - France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan. Canada has been heavily involved in the U.S.-led push to use the frozen assets to help Ukraine, something the federal government has flaunted during the summit. \"We're very happy that this is something that leaders have been able to make a political commitment to today,\" said Cindy Termorshuizen, the personal representative of the prime minister for the G7 summit. \"There's some technical work to be done. But we're really confident that this is going to bring US$50 billion to Ukraine.\" The G7 announced it was freezing Russian central bank assets in 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, Trudeau commended the G7 for the latest announcement. \"Canada's actually the first country to announce $5 billion of that will be a Canadian contribution,\" he said. Zelenskyy thanked Trudeau \"for your loud voice\" in support of Ukraine. A government source not authorized to discuss matters publicly said Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was making calls last month to her G7 counterparts to drum up support for an agreement to use the assets to deliver more financial help to Ukraine. As leaders announced the increased support on Thursday, Canada joined the U.S. and the U.K. in delivering a stark warning over Russian interference in Moldova, which neighbours Ukraine. The three countries said in a statement that Russian actors are \"carrying out a plot to influence outcomes\" of the country's upcoming presidential election this fall. \"They intend to incite protests in Moldova should a pro-Russia candidate not win,\" the statement said. \"They seek to foment negative public perceptions of Western governments, Moldova's incumbent leadership and Moldova's potential for EU integration, while degrading public confidence in Moldova's ability to secure itself and maintain rule of law\" The statement said the three countries have full confidence in Moldova's ability to manage the threats, and they are taking measures to support the efforts. \"By revealing the Kremlin's plot, we are making it clear to Moscow that we stand for free and fair elections and will not tolerate its attempts to meddle and undermine democratic processes,\" it said. Against that backdrop, U.S. President Joe Biden and Zelenskyy signed a new agreement on the sidelines of the summit Thursday designed to bolster Ukraine's defences in the long term. Canada has also announced sanctions against 11 people and 16 entities connected to Russia's \"military-industrial complex,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a news release. That includes entities involved in circumventing sanctions on Russian oil. Trudeau held meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on the first day of the summit. Other issues on the agenda are the Israel-Hamas war, China's industrial policy and partnership with Africa. After a recent European parliamentary election result that shored up support for far-right political parties, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni seemed to kick off the summit by flexing her muscles as one of the most stable leaders in the group. Italian negotiators successfully removed the word \"abortion\" from a draft of a G7 communique that leaders expect to release during the summit, though it still reaffirms commitments to abortion rights agreed to last year, the ANSA news agency reported. Asked about the change, Macron told an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit: \"I regret this.\" He added that France includes a women's right to abortion in its constitution, and the country defends \"this vision of equality between women and men.\" Termorshuizen would not comment on whether abortion will be mentioned in the final communique. \"You'll see in the communique tomorrow that there is very strong language on gender equality on LGBTQ issues,\" she said. On Friday, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit. He is expected to speak about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, and also to renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Ukrainian President Zelenskiy will sign security agreements with the U.S. and Japan. Discussions also covered China's economic ambitions and Middle East tensions.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies agreed an outline deal on Thursday to provide $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022. The political agreement was the centrepiece of the opening day in southern Italy of the annual summit of G7 leaders, attended for a second successive year by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader will sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday, as well as one with fellow G7 member Japan. Many of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they also seek to counter China's economic ambitions.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia. The G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300 billion of impounded Russian funds.\n\nThe technical details will be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters. The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year. A senior U.S. official said the United States had agreed to provide up to $50 billion itself, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November, according to a person close to the talks. While Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority.\n\nMIDDLE EAST CONCERN The G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\". Western nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year. Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month. French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis. Eager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya. Although the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.\n\n($1 = 0.9256 euros)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

GUGLIELMO MANGIAPANE/REUTERS\n\nBorgo Egnazia, Italy -- Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) democracies started their annual summit on Thursday, many of them under a cloud at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they seek to help Ukraine and counter China's economic ambitions.\n\nHeading into two days of talks, diplomats said a deal had been agreed in principle on plans to issue $50bn of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their

will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nFor a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit, after which he will sign a new, long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders will almost certainly announce that they have agreed the outline of a multiyear loan using profits from impounded Russian funds, which legal experts will then finalise with the aim of raising cash by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\nA senior EU official confirmed there was an outline agreement.\n\nA person close to the talks said the point of deal was to ensure it could run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state -- a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November.\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the US was best served if it was closely aligned with its democratic allies, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given the looming re-election battle.\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial overcapacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries. \"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied -- to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements he hoped to see finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office's customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being addressed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,'\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in daily life: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nNicole Winfield reported from Bari.

Zelenskiy will also sign a new, long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden later in the day.\n\nThe G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some US$300 billion (NZ$386b) of impounded Russian funds.\n\nThe technical details are to be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters. The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year.\n\nThe United States had agreed to provide up to US$50 billion (NZ$81b) itself, a senior US official said, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November's election, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nRussia regards attempts by the West to take income from its frozen assets as criminal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday, adding that Moscow's response would be very painful for the European Union.\n\nStruggles at home\n\nMany of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they also seek to counter China's economic ambitions.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European parliament elections, leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that may undermine their authority.\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed US efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year.\n\nBiden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power in a national election next month, while French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing Mediterranean sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nThe G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers around the world such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@newshub.co.nz", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author",

This will be a loan syndicate. We're going to share the risk, because we have a shared commitment to get this done,\" the official said.\n\nHe would not say how much other G7 countries would contribute, beyond saying that the final summit statement in Puglia would speak of \"loans plural.\"\n\nShow unity\n\nThe G7 countries - which count the European Union as their unofficial eighth member - have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\n\"Today the G7 in Bari will show unity. Unity for Ukraine's freedom,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote earlier on X.\n\nGermany's finance minister, Christian Lindner, added: \"Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin our \"unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets\" - but confirmed the details still needed working out.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office has also said there was agreement, without providing details.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organizations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nZelensky said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 and the EU have frozen some \u20ac300 billion ($325 billion) of Russian assets, much of it frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organization based in Belgium.\n\nEU countries say they could generate between \u20ac2.5 and \u20ac3.0 billion per year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest.\n\nIrreplaceable role\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux. Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in the November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in the July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort and took a selfie with reporters.\n\nBut she had a serious message.\n\n\"The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardize our freedom and our democracy,\" she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity,\" particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@kyivpost.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

AFP\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky flew in to join US President Joe Biden and leaders from Italy, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, and Japan at a session of the Puglia talks dedicated to the war.\n\nTop of the agenda is a plan for an urgent $50-billion loan to help Kyiv with defense, budgetary support, and reconstruction after more than two years of war with Russia.\n\nThe loan would be secured against the future profits from interest on 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian central bank assets frozen by Western allies.\n\n\"Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine,\" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner wrote on X.\n\nHe said the agreement showed Russian President Vladimir Putin our \"unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets\".\n\n\"Now we are working on the details.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office had on Wednesday said there was a deal on providing the money by the end of this year.\n\n\"We are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Thursday while adding that the details still needed to be thrashed out.\n\nZelensky had earlier said he was expecting \"important decisions\" at the summit.\n\nHe also said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 countries -- which count the European Union as their unofficial eighth member -- have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\n\"Today the G7 in Bari will show unity. Unity for Ukraine's freedom,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organizations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nSullivan said the G7 leaders were aiming for a \"common vision\" on using the frozen assets.\n\n\"We have the major tentpoles of this decided but some of the specifics will be left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe EU agreed earlier this year to use the profits from the frozen Russian assets for Ukraine, worth up to three billion euros a year.\n\nBut the idea at the G7 is to use this to provide more and faster help through a massive upfront loan.\n\nThe US this week also announced a raft of new sanctions aimed at constraining Moscow's war machine, while raising the stakes for foreign banks that still deal with Russia.\n\nThe UK later followed suit with its new sanctions, including targeting Moscow's main stock exchange.\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux. Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in the November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in the July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort, and took a selfie with reporters.\n\nBut she had a serious message.\n\n\"The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardize our freedom and our democracy,\" she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with a short session on Africa, development, and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerned about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nAround a dozen non-G7 leaders have also been invited for talks on Friday, including Jordan's King Abdullah II, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, India's Narendra Modi, and Pope Francis.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629

He'll be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied -- to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith President Joe Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron also facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\n\"It is a strong signal that we are sending to Ukraine that we will support Ukraine in its fight for freedom for as long as it takes,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"It is also a strong signal to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that Putin cannot outlast us,\" she said.\n\nA French official said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- for example, when the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements he hoped to see finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. and Japan.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds ($310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMeloni went into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nMeloni didn't hesitate to flex her far-right muscles in the opening sessions: Italian negotiators successfully removed the word abortion from the G7 final communique. The text however does reaffirm commitments made at last year's G7, where abortion rights were specified, according to a draft seen by the ANSA news agency.\n\n\"I regret this,\" Macron said about the text, answering the question of an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit. He recalled that France had included a women's right to abortion in its Constitution, and that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men.\"\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" he said. \"I regret it, but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\" he told the Italian reporter.\n\nMeloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has insisted that she won't roll back abortion rights in Italy, where they have been legal since 1978, but the center-left opposition worries she is slowly chipping away at them.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers while also emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries on Friday as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in daily life: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\n___\n\nWinfield reported from Bari, Italy.

It is the windfall profits from the Russian immobilised assets in Europe that will serve it,\" von der Leyen told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 summit in southern Italy.\n\n\"The finance ministers are now going through the details - for example, the topic of backstops that are necessary - and [will] clarify this as soon as possible.\"\n\nGermany's Finance Minister Christian Lindner hailed \"unity\" following the agreement.\n\n\"Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe deal on Ukraine's loan agreed upon at the three-day summit, where leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies are convening, marks \"a very historic step and a historic decision,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday.\n\n\"The next step will be just to create the technical conditions for implementation in the shortest possible time,\" Scholz said.\n\nScholz added that G7 leaders are sending a clear message to Russian President Vladimir Putin and demonstrating their unity and determination.\n\n\"The Russian president has a very obvious plan: he wants to push ahead with his war until everyone else gives up supporting Ukraine. This plan has failed today,\" the chancellor said.\n\n\"With the G7 states' plan to mobilise $50bn, which will be financed from the windfall profits of the frozen Russian assets, the foundation has been laid for Ukraine to be able to procure everything it needs in the near future, not only in terms of weapons, but also for reconstruction or energy infrastructure.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that finance ministers would now work on the details of the agreement.\n\nReporting from Moscow, Yulia Shapovalova said Russian Foreign Ministry representative Maria Zakharova said using those profits would be \"extremely painful for Brussels\", as Russia owns significant European property and funds.\n\n\"So Europe will first have to pay for all its madness out of its own wallet,\" said Zakharova.\n\nEarlier, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said actions against Russian assets in the West would receive a \"reciprocal response\" because in Russia essentially the same amount of Western funds have been frozen. He noted recently Russia has \"income\" from those assets.\n\nAlso on Thursday, US President Joe Biden and Zelenskyy signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe agreement, signed on the sidelines of the summit, is meant to be a step towards Ukraine's eventual NATO membership, according to the text of the deal.\n\n\"The parties recognise this agreement as supporting a bridge to Ukraine's eventual membership in the NATO alliance,\" the text says.\n\nZelenskyy has long sought NATO membership but the allies have stopped short of taking that step. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause.\n\nIn the event of an armed attack or threat of such against Ukraine, top US and Ukrainian officials will meet within 24 hours to consult on a response and determine what additional defence needs are required for Ukraine, the agreement says.\n\nUnder the agreement, the United States restates its support for Ukraine's defence of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, amid a renewed push by Russia on Ukraine's eastern front.\n\n\"To ensure Ukraine's security, both sides recognise Ukraine needs a significant military force, robust capabilities, and sustained investments in its defense industrial base that are consistent with North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] standards,\" the text says.\n\n\"The United States intends to provide long-term materiel, training and advising, sustainment, intelligence, security, defense industrial, institutional, and other support to develop Ukrainian security and defense forces that are capable of defending a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine and deterring future aggression,\" it says.\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, Israel's continuing assault in Gaza is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux, with summit attendees aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November's elections.\n\nThe UK's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is tipped to be toppled in July 4 elections, while France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, Italy's Meloni is riding high after her far-right party came out on top in her country's EU Parliament vote.\n\nThe summit talks began with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nG7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of captives taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden said he has not lost hope of getting an agreement on a Gaza ceasefire, but called on the Palestinian Hamas group to step up.\n\nBiden, asked if he was confident there would be a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel soon, said, \"No\".\n\n\"I haven't lost hope, but it's going to be tough,\" he told reporters. \"Hamas has to move.\"\n\nMediators from the US, Qatar and Egypt have tried for months to broker a ceasefire amid Israel's deadly assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 37,200 Palestinians and devastated the heavily populated enclave.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This will be a loan syndicate. We're going to share the risk, because we have a shared commitment to get this done,\" the official said.\n\nHe would not say how much other G7 countries would contribute, beyond saying that the final summit statement in Puglia would speak of \"loans plural\".\n\n- Show unity -\n\nThe G7 countries -- which count the European Union as their unofficial eighth member -- have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\n\"Today the G7 in Bari will show unity. Unity for Ukraine's freedom,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote earlier on X.\n\nGermany's finance minister, Christian Lindner, added: \"Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin our \"unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets\" -- but confirmed the details still needed working out.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office has also said there was agreement, without providing details.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nMore from this section Blinken in Israel as UN Security Council endorses cease-fire plan Authorities: 3 North Jersey men sentenced for roles in ghost gun operation King Charles 'will not be commenting' on portrait attack by protesters, Cameron Walker reveals\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nZelensky said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 and the EU have frozen some 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian assets, much of it frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organisation based in Belgium.\n\nEU countries say they could generate between 2.5 and 3.0 billion euros per year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest.\n\n- Irreplaceable role -\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux. Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort, and took a selfie with reporters.\n\nBut she had a serious message.\n\n\"The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardise our freedom and our democracy,\" she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nbur-ar/ide/jj", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_kemp@reformer.com", "name": "Danny

Around 1,300 journalists are expected to cover the summit.\n\nUnsuitable conditions of a cruise ship, which will accommodate approximately 2,600 security officers on duty in Brindisi, the arrival city of the G7 leaders, have become the subject of criticism in the Italian press.\n\nThe uncleanliness of the beds and toilets on the ship, as well as the lack of clean water from the taps, have prompted reactions from security units.\n\nDuring the summit on June 13-15, anti-G7 protest demonstrations are also expected to take place in different cities of the Puglia Region, such as Brindisi and Bari.

On the first evening, the leaders will attend a dinner in their honour in the nearby city of Brindisi. The media centre is in the city of Bari, 80 km (50 miles) from the summit venue.\n\nThe G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Britain. The European Union participates in all discussions and is represented by the presidents of both the European Council and the European Commission.\n\nThe host country traditionally invites outside guests to join some of the sessions. Italy has thrown open the doors and will this year welcome Pope Francis, the King of Jordan as well as the leaders of Ukraine, India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Algeria and Mauritania, which holds the presidency of the African Union.\n\nIn addition, the secretary-general of the United Nations and heads of the World Bank and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe will be present.\n\nThe summit is due to kick off at 11:00 a.m (0900 GMT) on Thursday with a discussion about Africa, climate change and development. The conversation then switches to the Middle East before two sessions dedicated to Ukraine - the first including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nDay two has sessions on immigration, the Indo Pacific and economic security before the arrival in the afternoon of the outreach partners for talks on the Mediterranean, energy and Africa. Pope Francis will lead talks on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nMuch focus will be on whether the leaders can finally reach agreement on how to leverage profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the West and use them for Ukraine.\n\nU.S. officials also expect the G7 to send a tough warning next week to smaller Chinese banks to stop assisting Russia in evading Western sanctions.\n\nMore broadly, sources in Washington say the United States is poised to announce significant new sanctions against financial institutions and non-banks that are part of the \"technology and goods channels\" that supply the Russian military. It is unclear if the rest of the G7 is ready to follow a tough U.S. line.\n\nChina will also be discussed at length. The leaders are likely to issue a statement expressing concern on Chinese industrial overcapacity and will also look at the possibility of imposing additional measures to level the field with heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Again, the United States feels much more strongly about this than some EU nations.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to express their resolve in addressing the heavy debt burden faced by many emerging market and developing countries, but it is not clear what this commitment will mean in real terms.\n\nItaly is still pushing for an accord on a global minimum tax on multinationals, even if it said last month that a deal would not be finalised by June as previously planned.\n\nOfficially the summit runs until June 15, but U.S. President Joe Biden is flying out on the night of June 14 and the only official item for Saturday, at present, is the closing news conference of host Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, plus a number of bilaterals for remaining leaders.\n\n(Reporting by Crispian

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied -- to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements he hoped to see finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office's customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being addressed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,'\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in daily life: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nNicole Winfield reported from Bari.

A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support UkraineThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboardItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligencePope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIt's happening where?The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower.

It would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral.\n\nThe long-awaited decision came on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit taking place in Apulia, Italy.\n\nThe three-day summit is an opportunity for collaboration among the leaders of the wealthy democracies - France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan.\n\nCanada has been heavily involved in the U.S.-led push to use the frozen assets to help Ukraine, something the federal government has flaunted during the summit.\n\n\"We're very happy that this is something that leaders have been able to make a political commitment to today,\" said Cindy Termorshuizen, the personal representative of the prime minister for the G7 summit.\n\n\"There's some technical work to be done. But we're really confident that this is going to bring US$50 billion to Ukraine.\"\n\nThe G7 announced it was freezing Russian central bank assets in 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, Trudeau commended the G7 for the latest announcement.\n\n\"Canada's actually the first country to announce $5 billion of that will be a Canadian contribution,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy thanked Trudeau \"for your loud voice\" in support of Ukraine.\n\nA government source not authorized to discuss matters publicly said Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was making calls last month to her G7 counterparts to drum up support for an agreement to use the assets to deliver more financial help to Ukraine.\n\nAs leaders announced the increased support on Thursday, Canada joined the U.S. and the U.K. in delivering a stark warning over Russian interference in Moldova, which neighbours Ukraine.\n\nThe three countries said in a statement that Russian actors are \"carrying out a plot to influence outcomes\" of the country's upcoming presidential election this fall.\n\n\"They intend to incite protests in Moldova should a pro-Russia candidate not win,\" the statement said.\n\n\"They seek to foment negative public perceptions of Western governments, Moldova's incumbent leadership and Moldova's potential for EU integration, while degrading public confidence in Moldova's ability to secure itself and maintain rule of law\"\n\nThe statement said the three countries have full confidence in Moldova's ability to manage the threats, and they are taking measures to support the efforts.\n\n\"By revealing the Kremlin's plot, we are making it clear to Moscow that we stand for free and fair elections and will not tolerate its attempts to meddle and undermine democratic processes,\" it said.\n\nCanada has also announced sanctions against 11 people and 16 entities connected to Russia's \"military-industrial complex,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a news release. That includes entities involved in circumventing sanctions on Russian oil.\n\nTrudeau held meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on the first day of the summit.\n\nOther issues on the agenda are the Israel-Hamas war, China's industrial policy and partnership with Africa.\n\nAfter a recent European parliamentary election result that shored up support for far-right political parties, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni seemed to kick off the summit by flexing her muscles as one of the most stable leaders in the group.\n\nItalian negotiators successfully removed the word \"abortion\" from a draft of a G7 communique that leaders expect to release during the summit, though it still reaffirms commitments to abortion rights agreed to last year, the ANSA news agency reported.\n\nAsked about the change, Macron told an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit: \"I regret this.\"\n\nHe added that France includes a women's right to abortion in its constitution, and the country defends \"this vision of equality between women and men.\"\n\nTermorshuizen would not comment on whether abortion will be mentioned in the final communique.\n\n\"You'll see in the communique tomorrow that there is very strong language on gender equality on LGBTQ issues,\" she said.\n\nOn Friday, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit.\n\nHe is expected to speak about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, and also to renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 13, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgeherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Lethbridge

Representational Image: ANI\n\nA Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a US proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region.\n\nHe'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support UkraineThe US proposal involves engineering a USD 50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or USD 310 million) in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote.\n\nMacron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nOne sign of her flexed far-right muscles:\n\nMeloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligencePope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasising the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts.\n\nOne of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest:\n\ntechnology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theatre set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower.\n\nA favourite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting.\n\nOne group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet\".", "source": {"uri": "zeebiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee Business"}, "authors":

This will be a loan syndicate. We're going to share the risk, because we have a shared commitment to get this done,\" the official said.\n\nHe would not say how much other G7 countries would contribute, beyond saying that the final summit statement in Puglia would speak of \"loans plural\".\n\n- Show unity -\n\nThe G7 countries -- which count the European Union as their unofficial eighth member -- have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\n\"Today the G7 in Bari will show unity. Unity for Ukraine's freedom,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote earlier on X.\n\nGermany's finance minister, Christian Lindner, added: \"Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin our \"unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets\" -- but confirmed the details still needed working out.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office has also said there was agreement, without providing details.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nZelensky said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 and the EU have frozen some 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian assets, much of it frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organisation based in Belgium.\n\nEU countries say they could generate between 2.5 and 3.0 billion euros per year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest.\n\n- Irreplaceable role -\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux. Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort, and took a selfie with reporters.\n\nBut she had a serious message.\n\n\"The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardise our freedom and our democracy,\" she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nbur-ar/ide/jj\n\nMore from this section\n\nMortgage Interest Rate Sensitivity Triggers 25% Spike in May Rate-and-Term Refinance Activity\n\nMCT and Lender Price Join

Zelenskiy will also sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden later in the day.\n\nThe G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300 billion of impounded Russian funds.\n\nThe technical details are to be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters. The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year.\n\nThe United States had agreed to provide up to $50 billion itself, a senior U.S. official said, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November's election, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nRussia regards attempts by the West to take income from its frozen assets as criminal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday, adding that Moscow's response would be very painful for the European Union.\n\nSTRUGGLES AT HOME\n\nMany of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they also seek to counter China's economic ambitions.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European parliament elections, leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that may undermine their authority.\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year.\n\nBiden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power in a national election next month, while French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing Mediterranean sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nThe G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers around the world such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\n($1 = 0.9256 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray, Andrea Shalal, Thomas Escritt and John IrishWriting by Crispian Balmer and

He'll be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nAlso Read | US Tourist Dies, Wife Suffers Critical Injuries After Being Electrocuted in Hot Tub at Mexico Resort.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied -- to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron also facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a USD 50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\n\"It is a strong signal that we are sending to Ukraine that we will support Ukraine in its fight for freedom for as long as it takes,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"It is also a strong signal to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that Putin cannot outlast us,\" she said.\n\nA French official said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- for example, when the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements he hoped to see finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. and Japan.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds (USD 310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkiye. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni went into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nMeloni didn't hesitate to flex her far-right muscles in the opening sessions: Italian negotiators successfully removed the word abortion from the G7 final communique. The text however does reaffirm commitments made at last year's G7, where abortion rights were specified, according to a draft seen by the ANSA news agency.\n\n\"I regret this,\" Macron said about the text, answering the question of an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit. He recalled that France had included a women's right to abortion in its Constitution, and that France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men\".\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" he said. \"I regret it, but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\" he told the Italian reporter.\n\nMeloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Family, Fatherland\" motto, has insisted that she won't roll back abortion rights in Italy, where they have been legal since 1978, but the centre-left opposition worries she is slowly chipping away at them.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers while also emphasising the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries on Friday as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in daily life: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.

The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year.\n\nA senior U.S. official said the United States had agreed to provide up to $50 billion itself, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority.\n\nMIDDLE EAST CONCERN\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year.\n\nBiden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month. French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.\n\n($1 = 0.9256 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray, Andrea Shalal, Thomas Escritt and John IrishWriting by

Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nThe G7 summit opens Thursday morning with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II -- a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel 30 years ago -- is among around a dozen non-G7 guests also attending who are not, however, participating in the working sessions.\n\nThey include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency this year -- as well as Argentina's Javier Milei and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also plan to attend.\n\nAll the guests are invited to a dinner Friday night at the Borgo Egnazia luxury hotel complex, built in the style of a traditional village.\n\nWith security extremely tight, the venue is far away from protesters and journalists, with the media center located some 60 kilometers away in Bari.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity,\" particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe US, EU and Japan have all voiced concern that generous subsidies from Beijing are resulting in a flood of cheap goods hitting the global market, threatening Western firms.", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType":

Activate your Online Access Now\n\nLeaders of the G7 countries have agreed to engineer a US$50-billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral.\n\nThe news comes on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit taking place in Apulia, Italy.\n\nThe three-day summit is an opportunity for collaboration among the leaders of the wealthy democracies -- France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan.\n\nCanada has been heavily involved in the U.S.-led push to use the frozen central bank assets to help Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 announced it was freezing Russian central bank assets in 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA government source not authorized to discuss matters publicly says Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was making calls last month to her G7 counterparts to drum up support for an agreement to use the assets to deliver more financial help to Ukraine.\n\nAs the first day of the summit kicks off, Prime Minister Trudeau is scheduled to have meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nHe is also set to participate in working sessions with other leaders on collaboration with Africa, climate change, the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\nTrudeau is headed to Switzerland on Saturday to attend a summit on Ukraine, where a larger group of countries will meet to discuss a future path to peace.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, Pool)\n\nBARI, Italy (AP) -- A Group of Seven summit is opening today with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to $310 million in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nAngela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report from Paris.", "source": {"uri": "vindy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vindicator"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Other leaders attending the G7 summit are French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nIn an election year, the G7 summit holds significant importance for President Biden. As with his recent trip to France, he is expected to use the occasion to stress the importance of alliances.\n\nOn June 14, President Biden will meet with Pope Francis, according to the White House. The Vatican confirmed in April that the Pope will join the leaders' summit, participating in a special session on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\"This is the first time in history that a pontiff will participate in the work of a G7,\" Ms. Meloni said on April 26.\n\n\"There's been very good progress in the discussions among the G7 delegations here to reach an agreement on how to make that happen,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on June 13.\n\n\"And hopefully, by the time the leaders meet today, we will have a common vision for the way forward. And the Italian presidency will be able to announce that there is a path forward. But we'll all just have to wait and see what happens here in a few hours time.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the crucial summit, the G7 finance ministers held discussions about the legality of using some $300 billion worth of frozen assets kept in European accounts as collateral for providing a loan to Ukraine for reconstruction. France was believed to be the main holdout on the plan.\n\nPresident Biden mentioned before leaving France last week that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Macron on a plan to use the frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe proposal under discussion involves using the profits from the assets, specifically the interest earned, as collateral to provide Ukraine with a loan through a sovereign lender. Italy will capture the spotlight this week if the G7 leaders can agree on the details of this proposal.\n\n\"This has been something that the United States has put a lot of energy and effort into because we see the proceeds from these assets as being a valuable source of resources for Ukraine,\" Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nThe security pact comes after President Biden and the leaders of the G7 countries agreed last year at the NATO summit in Vilnius that they would each sign bilateral security agreements with Ukraine.\n\nSo far, 15 countries have already entered into direct bilateral security agreements with Ukraine, according to the White House.\n\nMr. Sullivan briefed reporters ahead of the bilateral meeting, describing the agreement as a milestone moment.\n\n\"We think this is a big deal, a milestone moment in the partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine,\" Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nHe added that the agreement is \"a real marker\" of U.S. commitment for the long term \"both in defending against Russian aggression and in deterring future aggression so that Ukraine can be a sovereign, viable, thriving democracy.\"\n\nThe security agreement, however, doesn't include any commitment to use U.S. forces to defend Ukraine.\n\nMr. Sullivan declined to confirm if the United States will send another Patriot missile system to Ukraine, saying that an announcement would not be made during the Biden-Zelenskyy meeting.\n\nPresident Biden reportedly approved sending the Patriot missile system to Ukraine in response to Kyiv's desperate demand for additional air defenses as it confronts an intensive Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nThe decision, which was first reported by The New York Times, has not been publicly announced.\n\nAccording to Mr. Sullivan, the security agreement does not include specific dollar figures for supporting Ukraine.\n\n\"It includes a commitment to work with Congress on sustainable funding going forward, which we will do,\" he told reporters on June 12 on Air Force One en route to Italy.\n\n\"And it lays out a framework for how we work with Ukraine and with other allies and partners to ensure Ukraine has what it needs in terms of the physical capacity as well as the intelligence and other capacities to be able to defend itself effectively and to deter Russia.\"\n\nThe president will meet with Mr. Zelenskyy for the second time in a week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He\u00b4ll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia\u00b4s frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral. A French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen - say if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries. In addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy\u00b4s first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7\u00b4s two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron\u00b4s office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.", "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

The agreement, endorsed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and U.S. President Joe Biden, aims to support Ukraine's defense against Russia. Technical details are expected to be finalized soon.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven major democracies agreed on an outline deal on Thursday to provide $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow invaded its neighbour in 2022. The political agreement was the centrepiece of the opening day in southern Italy of the annual summit of G7 leaders, attended for a second successive year by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nHe signed a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden after signing a 10-year security accord with Japan, with Tokyo promising to provide Kyiv with $4.5 billion this year -- underlining continued strong backing from the West. Calling the frozen asset agreement a \"significant outcome\", Biden told reporters it was \"another reminder to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that we're not backing down.\"\n\nThe G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300 billion of impounded Russian funds, the bulk of which are blocked in the European Union. The technical details will be finalised in the coming weeks, with the new cash expected to reach Kyiv by the end of this year thanks to contributions from all G7 states -- the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Italy.\n\n\"This is a very clear commitment that should embolden the Ukrainians to do what they need to to defend their independence and sovereignty,\" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The aim of the deal is to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November's election, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nRussia regards attempts by the West to take income from its frozen assets as criminal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday, adding that Moscow's response would be very painful for the European Union. STRUGGLES AT HOME\n\nMany of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but looked to project confidence on the world stage as they confront an array of problems, including China's economic ambitions, the growth of artificial intelligence and turmoil in the Middle East. The leaders expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\". Western nations are also expected to voice both unanimous concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year. Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power in a national election next month, while French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni under a blazing Mediterranean sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where the summit is being held. However, the display of unity was undermined late in the day, when Macron clashed with the anti-abortion Meloni over a push by Italy to remove any direct reference to abortion rights in the final communique.\n\nMore than a dozen outsiders will join the discussions on Friday, including the leaders of India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya, while Pope Francis is due to speak about the risks and potential of artificial intelligence.

Around 1,300 journalists are expected to cover the summit.\n\nUnsuitable conditions of a cruise ship, which will accommodate approximately 2,600 security officers on duty in Brindisi, the arrival city

reactions from security units.\n\nDuring the summit on June 13-15, anti-G7 protest demonstrations are also expected to take place in different cities of the Puglia Region, such as Brindisi and Bari.",

This will be a loan syndicate. We're going to share the risk, because we have a shared commitment to get this done,\" the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nHe would not say how much other G7 countries would contribute.\n\n- 'Historic step' -\n\nG7 countries, which count the European Union as their unofficial eighth member, have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nThe G7 and the EU have frozen around 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian assets, much of it frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organisation based in Belgium.\n\nEU countries say they could generate 2.5 to 3.0 billion euros a year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz hailed the loan agreement as a \"historic step\" and a \"clear signal to the Russian president that he cannot simply sit this matter out\".\n\n\"The basis has been created for Ukraine to be in a position to procure everything it needs... in the near future, in terms of weapons but also in terms of investment in reconstruction or in energy infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at shoring up international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nIn Puglia on Thursday, he signed two more security agreements, with Japan and the United States.\n\n- Political flux -\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict in Gaza is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux, with summit attendees aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November elections.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, Italy's Meloni is riding high after her far-right party came out on top in her country's EU Parliament vote.\n\nThe summit talks began with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nG7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nbur-ar/ide/ams/js", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_kemp@ktbs.com", "name":

Agencies\n\nThe leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) advanced democracies have gathered for their annual summit in Puglia, Italy. The wars in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine are at the top of the agenda at the G7 summit, taking place between 13-15 June.\n\nThe G7- comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States- is poised to introduce a range of measures designed to support Ukraine, applying pressure on Russia and its allies.\n\nWe explain how this G7 summit is likely to bring some much-needed relief to Ukraine.\n\nFinancial support and loans for Ukraine\n\nShoring up financial support for Ukraine is a top priority at the G7 meeting. US and European officials are exploring innovative ways to fund Ukraine's needs, especially in light of potential political shifts in the U.S. that could affect future support. One significant proposal involves using the profits generated by immobilized Russian assets to provide a substantial up-front loan to Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 nations and the European Union are considering using interest earned on approximately $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to secure a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. This innovative financial mechanism could provide crucial funding for Kyiv by the end of the year, supporting its ongoing fight and stabilizing its economy.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy's bilateral meetings\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is actively engaging with world leaders on the sidelines of the G7 summit to secure further support. In a post on social media platform X on 13 June, he said, \"Today, I will attend the G7 meeting and hold a number of bilateral meetings. I will meet with the Summit's host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, as well as Canadian and UK Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau and Rishi Sunak.\"\n\nZelenskyy revealed that Kyiv will sign bilateral security agreements during meetings with US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. He mentioned that for Ukraine, the main issues are developing a fighter jet coalition, expediting pilot training, and accelerating aircraft delivery. \"Development of the Ukrainian air defense system based on the most powerful Western systems, as well as an increase in long-range capability. Approval of the format for using Russian assets to benefit Ukraine, particularly in the development of our defence industry, and joint weapon production,\" he said.\n\nSanctions and export controls on Russia\n\nOne of the key strategies discussed at the G7 summit is the implementation of new sanctions and export controls targeting Russia. These measures are intended to cripple entities and networks aiding Russian military efforts. The US has already expanded its sanctions, targeting companies, particularly those based in China, that supply semiconductors to Russia. This move aims to disrupt the flow of critical technology to the Russian military.\n\nThe Commerce Department in the US has also taken action against shell companies in Hong Kong that divert semiconductors to Russia, impacting nearly $100 million worth of high-priority items for Moscow. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to weaken Russia's war economy and its ability to sustain military operations against Ukraine.\n\nPressure on China\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms ahead of the G7 meeting, President Biden aims to rally Western allies to take a firmer stance against Beijing's support for Russia. The restrictions are intended to curb China's role in supplying critical materials to Russia, thereby limiting Moscow's capacity to sustain its military operations. This move also highlights the interconnected nature of global politics and the strategic importance of unified action against aggressor states.\n\nSending a message to Russia\n\nUS President Joe Biden is set to sign an unprecedented security agreement with Ukraine during the G7 summit.\n\nAccording to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, this agreement will send a resolute message to Russia about the steadfast nature of the coalition backing Ukraine. \"If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" he said.\n\nAdditional support measures\n\nBeyond financial mechanisms and sanctions, the G7 summit will see various leaders pledging additional support for Ukraine. For instance, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to announce up to $309 million in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs. This support is crucial for helping Ukraine manage the immediate impacts of the conflict on its civilian population and infrastructure.\n\nOverall, it is expected to be a fruitful summit for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person",

The Head of State had a chance to talk to the Prime Minister of Italy George Meloni, the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, and the President of the European Council Charles Michel.\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine is at the center of attention of the G7\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine is the main topic on the agenda of the G7 summit. During his consultations with the G7 leaders, the Ukrainian president is expected to once again emphasize the need for the Armed Forces to repel Russian aggression. Zelenskyy is likely to ask his partners for more long-range weapons, ammunition, and even more air defense capabilities.\n\nIt is worth noting that on the eve of the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised to provide Ukraine with additional air defense systems. At the same time, other European countries, including those with Patriot air defense systems, which Ukraine needs, are delaying the delivery of weapons systems.\n\nBefore the opening of the summit, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the main topics for Ukraine would be the development of a coalition of fighter jets, accelerated pilot training, and accelerated delivery of aircraft. Attention will also be focused on the development of the Ukrainian air defense system based on the most powerful Western systems and the increase of long-range capabilities. In addition, the head of state expects the G7 leaders to approve a format for using Russian assets in favor of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy also said that bilateral security agreements would be signed at the summit not only with the United States but also with Japan. The president emphasized that the document with the United States would be unprecedented, as befits leaders who support Ukraine.\n\nUnited States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that support for Ukraine's air defense remains a priority. At the same time, in addition to Patriot air defense missile systems, other systems should be transferred.\n\n\"As for Patriot. You know that air defense is a priority. We emphasize every time that we need to provide Ukraine with additional Patriot systems. But not only that, we spend a lot of time urging other countries to provide not only Patriots but other air defense systems to Ukraine,\" Austin said.\n\nHe noted that there are currently no new announcements regarding Patriot, but all efforts are aimed at providing Ukraine with additional capabilities as soon as possible.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on the sidelines of the G7 summit that the partners \"will show unity for a free Ukraine and a peaceful Middle East.\"\n\n\"In turbulent times, the strongest message we can send is unity. Unity for the sake of Ukraine's freedom. We are working for further financial support,\" she said.\n\nThe President noted that the G7 summit had reaffirmed clear support for Ukraine, international law, and a just peace.\n\n\"Every day we strengthen our positions and add strength to our defense of life. Every meeting is for the sake of Ukraine getting new opportunities for victory. I am grateful to all our partners!\" he added.\n\nSending NATO troops to Ukraine\n\nIn addition, the issue of deploying Western military forces to Ukraine is likely to be raised during the G7 summit in Italy. To date, the G7 countries have not reached a consensus on this issue. France remains the most active, as President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly said that he is ready to send his troops to Ukraine.\n\nThe United Kingdom is also open to sending its military to Ukraine, but so far it is only about instructors and advisors who can train Ukrainian soldiers. At the same time, Germany, Italy, and the United States are categorically against sending Western troops to Ukraine.\n\nMultibillion-dollar support for Ukraine\n\nThe chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Finance, Taxation, and Customs Policy, Danylo Hetmantsev, said that the G7 summit in Italy would be very important for Ukraine in financial terms, as one of the main topics to be discussed at the meeting at the initiative of the United States will be the securitization of Russian assets.\n\nAccording to him, it is a question of issuing securities backed by income from the frozen assets of the Russian bank in the long term. Through the sale of these securities, it is planned to provide Ukraine with concessional financing worth about $50 billion starting in 2025. At the same time, Hetmantsev emphasized that there are still many unresolved issues regarding how the deal will be structured. In particular, it is not yet known which countries will provide funding and in what proportion, and how guarantees will be provided that the assets, most of which are in the EU, will remain frozen for a long time and generate cash flow.\n\nMr. Hetmantsev is confident that if the issue of financing is approved, it will be a very important milestone for Ukraine in the coming years. According to him, this will help to cover the need for external financing for 2025, which the Ministry of Finance estimates at $32 billion. The parliamentarian also emphasized that Ukraine will be able to receive a guarantee of such funding regardless of political cycles, including the US elections.\n\nThe G7 countries have agreed to allocate $50 billion from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's defense, economy, and recovery. The money will be available closer to 2025. Final technical details of the agreement will be agreed upon after the summit. The aid can be used to support Ukraine's defense, economy, and recovery. The G7 leaders have repeatedly stated that the assets will remain blocked until Russia agrees to pay for Ukraine's reconstruction.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the loan Ukraine will receive will be repaid from the profits generated by Russia's blocked assets. The deal is expected to provide critical support for Kyiv in the medium term. In particular, it will help cover the country's financial needs until 2025 and beyond.\n\nAt the same time, the proceeds from Russia's frozen assets are estimated at 3 to 5 billion euros ($3.24 to $5.39 billion).\n\nHowever, the repayment of the loan will depend on how long Russia's assets remain frozen. G7 leaders have repeatedly stated that assets will be blocked until Russia agrees to pay for Ukraine's recovery.\n\nZelenskyy and Biden meet on the sidelines of the G7\n\nOn the eve of the G7 summit in Italy, the White House announced bilateral talks between US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. John Kirby, Strategic Communications Coordinator at the US Security Council, said that the heads of state would meet to discuss \"strong support for Ukraine, both now and in the future.\" Kirby also promised that Biden and Zelenskyy would hold a press conference following the meeting.\n\nThe White House promises that during the G7 summit, bold steps will be taken to show dictator Vladimir Putin that time is not on his side and he will not be able to wait out the US support in the fight for the freedom of the Ukrainian people. The White House spokesman also emphasized that Russian aggression not only threatens democracy in Ukraine but affects security in the whole of Europe.\n\nIn addition, according to media reports, Zelenskyy and Biden intend to sign a bilateral agreement on security guarantees during the talks. According to the US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, by signing such an agreement, the United States will make it clear that its support for Ukraine will continue for a long time in the future.\n\nPope to hold bilateral talks with world leaders at G7 summit\n\nThe press service of the Holy See has announced that Pope Francis will take part in the G7 Summit, which is currently taking place in Borgo Eniazia, Puglia, Italy. In particular, he will speak at a session dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe Pope will also hold his first series of bilateral meetings with Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund; President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy; President of France Emmanuel Macron; and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe Pope is scheduled to deliver a speech at 14:15 local time in the Sala Arena, followed by a group photo at 17:30 after the other speeches.\n\nThe second series of bilateral meetings will be followed by the Pope's meetings with President of Kenya William Samoei Ruto; Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India; U.S. President Joseph Biden; Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil; Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President of Turkey; and President of Algeria Abdelmadjid Tebboune\n\nEarlier it was reported that the leaders of the G7 countries reached an agreement to allocate $50 billion for Ukraine through the use of frozen Russian assets. The decision will be made at the G7 summit scheduled for June 13-15.\n\nEarlier, Washington said that U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron support the use of profits from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AFP-Yonhap\n\nA Group of Seven summit opened Thursday with agreement reached on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni welcomed the G7 heads of state to the summit at a luxury resort in southern Italy, saying she wanted the message of this meeting to be one of dialogue with the global south and unity.\n\nShe likened the G7 to the ancient olive trees that are a symbol of the Puglia region, \"with their solid roots, and branches projected toward the future.\"\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence , but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune , Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\" (AP)",

Leaders to agree on $50 billion Ukraine loan using frozen Russian assets", "body": "BARI: G7 leaders were set to agree on a new $50 billion loan for Ukraine as they gathered Thursday for a summit in southern Italy, using the profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will join US President Joe Biden and leaders from Italy, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan for the talks at the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort in Puglia.\n\nTop of the agenda is a plan for an urgent $50-billion loan to help Kyiv with defence, budgetary support and reconstruction after more than two years of war with Russia.\n\nThe loan would be secured against the future profits from interest on 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian central bank assets frozen by Western allies.\n\n\"Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine,\" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner wrote on X.\n\n\"We are using interest from frozen assets for this -- a smart instrument that shows (Russian President Vladimir) Putin our unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets.\n\n\"Now we are working on the details.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office had on Wednesday said there was a deal on providing the money by the end of this year.\n\n\"We are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Thursday, adding that the details still needed to be thrashed out.\n\nCommon vision\n\nAhead of his arrival later in the day, Zelensky said he was expecting \"important decisions\" at the summit.\n\nHe also said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 countries have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nSullivan said the G7 leaders were aiming for a \"common vision\" on using the frozen assets.\n\n\"We have the major tentpoles of this decided but some of the specifics will be left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe European Union agreed earlier this year to use the profits from the frozen Russian assets for Ukraine, worth up to three billion euros a year.\n\nBut the idea at the G7 is to use this to provide more and faster help through a massive upfront loan.\n\nThis week, the US also announced a raft of new sanctions aimed at constraining Moscow's war machine while raising the stakes for foreign banks that still deal with Russia.\n\nIrreplaceable role\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux.\n\nEveryone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the Borgo Egnazia resort on Thursday morning, but she had a serious message.\n\n\"The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardise our freedom and our democracy,\" she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with a short session on Africa, development and climate change before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity,\" particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nAround a dozen non-G7 leaders have also been invited to Puglia for talks on Friday, including India's Narendra Modi, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed.", "source":

This will be a loan syndicate.

February 2022.\n\nThe G7 and the EU have frozen around 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian assets, much of it frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organisation based in

has been created for Ukraine to be in a position to procure everything it needs... in the near future, in terms of weapons but also in terms of investment in reconstruction or in energy

support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nIn Puglia on Thursday, he signed two more security agreements, with Japan and the United States.\n\n- Political flux -\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict in Gaza is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux, with summit attendees aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November elections.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, Italy's Meloni is riding high after her far-right party came out on top in her country's EU Parliament vote.\n\nThe summit talks began with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nG7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nbur-ar/ide/ams/js", "source":

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen - say if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communiqu\u00e9.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clock tower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces that have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

A similar deal is expected with the US.\n\nThe G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US have been key financial and military backers of Ukraine since a full-scale invasion by Russia in 2022.\n\n$325bn in Russian assets were frozen by the group, along with the EU, when Moscow invaded Ukraine. Most of the assets of the Central Bank of Russia are in Belgium.\n\nAccording to international law, countries cannot confiscate those assets from Russia and give them to Ukraine.\n\nThe plan is to borrow on international markets, give Ukrainians about $50 billion each year, and use $3bn each year to pay interest on that debt.\n\nBut there is still a lot of technology to sort out.\n\nPresident Biden's security adviser, Jake Sullivan, says the plan's \"major tentacles\" have been decided and are likely to pay off.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russian officials have spoken of the idea of taking interest from seized assets as \"theft,\" threatening retaliation.\n\nWith Mr Biden in the middle of a close election race and many Western leaders trailing in the polls, the pressure is on to give Ukraine as much support as they can.\n\nFacing an uphill battle ahead of next month's general election, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to announce up to $309 million in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's party also soon faces voters, who called for a snap parliamentary election after a landslide defeat for the far-right National Rally in last weekend's elections to the European Union's parliament.\n\nItaly's Giorgia Meloni boasted that her country was heading to the summit with \"the strongest government of all\" after a strong performance in last weekend's European elections.\n\nThe shaky political climate in many G7 countries leaves some observers with low expectations of what can be achieved.\n\nAlso on the agenda for the Summit at Savelletri Resort are:\n\nPope Francis - the first pontiff to attend the G7 summit - will address the conference on the topic of artificial intelligence.\n\nHe has previously called for global regulation of AI, warning of its risk to ethics and human rights.", "source": {"uri": "highlandstoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mid Florida Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He'll be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nAlso Read | Kia India Exports Nearly 2.55 Lakh Vehicles to Over 100 Markets in World Since 2019.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied -- to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a USD 50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nZelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements he hoped to see finalised during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the US.\n\n\"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nSunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or USD 310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia's military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkiye.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office's customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being addressed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially Mediterranean Summit,'\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasising the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialised countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector. But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest in daily life: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favourite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet\".

I don't expect leaders to say...(anything against it).\"\n\nA person close to the talks said the point of deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November.\n\nPACKED AGENDA\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given the looming re-election battle.\n\nUnderscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors":

Security Council endorsed the plan earlier this month, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Hamas has proposed numerous changes, describing some as unworkable, to the U.S.-backed proposal.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting on Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza, which has displaced many Palestinians and caused severe shortages of food, water and energy.\n\nThe group of major industrialized democracies has condemned the \"terrorist\" attacks conducted by Hamas on Oct. 7 that triggered the ongoing Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip, while avoiding criticizing Israel directly.\n\nIn Friday's sessions, the G7 members are set to discuss the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, where China has been intensifying its military activities, as well as economic security, artificial intelligence, energy and other issues.\n\nThe G7 leaders are expected to release a communique on Friday before Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni holds a

We hope that it is only the first of many more steps. And we will use this money wisely.'\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has meanwhile been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nRead More Russia's frozen assets could $300bn funding for Ukraine's war against Putin without costing Britain or US a penny but squabbling in Europe stopping it\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nZelensky said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe reopening of the Russian offensive in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has appeared to tip the balance for Western support in the last month, with donors allowing Ukraine to use their weapons against targets in Russia.\n\nUkrainian officials in Kharkiv have said since that the green light has restored a degree of calm to the city.\n\nUkraine has also received substantial funding from the United States to help fend off the attack - only a matter of weeks since the $61bn lifeline passed at the end of April.\n\nRussia has, in turn, responded with threats against the West for the perceived escalation of the war.\n\nPutin has threatened 'densely populated territories in the West with 'grave consequences' for lending materiel support to Ukraine.\n\nRepurposing Russian funds to give to Ukraine is similarly not without controversy.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in December that Russia would challenge any confiscation in the courts.\n\n'If something is confiscated from us, we will look at what we will confiscate,' Peskov said. 'We will do this immediately.'\n\nThe pair were joined by leaders from Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan\n\nRishi Sunak is also in Puglia to meet for two days of talks on global issues\n\nThe event brings together the leaders of G7, as well as the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission representing the European Union\n\nIn the wake of Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its allies prohibited transactions with Russia's central bank and finance ministry, blocking around $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets in the West.\n\nLike other central banks, the Russian central bank placed some of its gold and foreign exchange reserves in liquid assets such as major currencies, gold and government bonds. About half of those reserves were held in the West.\n\nThe United States previously proposed that working groups from the Group of Seven (G7) major industrialized nations explore ways to seize that money.\n\nEU countries say they could generate between 2.5 and 3.0 billion euros per year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Lords in April, David Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, suggested allied powers in the West were close to a breakthrough.\n\nHe assured that there was an 'emerging consensus' between Western countries on how to use the assets, with the US endorsing a plan to borrow billions to send to Ukraine in loans against future interest on the Russian assets.\n\nBill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management, told Radio 4 that issuing bonds on the future value of interest paid on the frozen assets was 'just overly complicating matters' and 'not the right approach'.\n\nDismissing the legal controversy around the seizure of such assets explicitly for Ukraine, he added: 'I think it's a political issue. Should the UK taxpayers be forking out money to Ukraine before Putin forks out the money?\n\n'And I think the answer is Putin should pay for it before we pay for it.'", "source": {"uri":

I don't expect leaders to say...(anything against it).\"\n\nA person close to the talks said the point of deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November.\n\nPACKED AGENDA\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given the looming re-election battle.\n\nUnderscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.\n\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray, Andrea Shalal, Thomas

The management of artificial intelligence (AI), issues facing Africa and climate change are also included in the key sessions.\n\nItaly is holding the G7 rotating presidency this year. In addition to the G7 leaders, heads of state from over ten other countries and international organizations were invited to attend the conference.\n\nOn the first day, the group discussed a draft deal for a 50-billion-U.S. dollar loan to Ukraine, using frozen Russian assets as guarantees.\n\nIn her latest response Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that G7's plans will not benefit the West and may result in new economic crisis.\n\nThe United States and Japan each signed security agreements with Ukraine, making them the last two G7 members to sign such pacts.\n\nProtests against the G7 summit are taking place in many places near the venue.\n\nOn the opening day, in Brindisi, a city 60 km away from the venue, protesters held Palestinian flags and displayed banners with slogans such as \"Boycott the G7,\" \"Stop Destroying the Planet,\" and \"No More War.\" They criticized the G7 for failing to play a positive role in environmental protection, social justice, and maintaining peace.\n\nLukas Hufert, an art student from Germany, traveled to participate in the protest. He told Xinhua that the G7's handling of international affairs is \"full of hypocrisy,\" likening it to a Trojan horse that appears grand but is filled with selfish schemes inside, \"offering no help

Perennial issues such as climate change and China also will be discussed.\n\nThe G7 is an informal forum with an annual summit to discuss economic policy and security issues. The members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Italian Premier Meloni opens G7 summit with agreement to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine\n\n-- In Italy's Puglia region, women take the lead in challenging the local mafia at great personal risk\n\n-- US pushes for Ukraine aid, united front against China's trade practices at G7 finance meeting\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a security agreement on Thursday during the Group of Seven summit, sending what they described as a message of unified opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"He cannot wait us out,\" Biden said. \"He cannot divide us.\"\n\nZelenskyy said the agreement demonstrated the \"credibility of American support for our Ukrainian independence.\"\n\nUkraine has been eager for fresh assistance to hold the line against Russia, which has recently made gains on the battlefield during a bloody war that's in its third year.\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy - French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday deplored that there was no reference to abortion in the final document of the Group of Seven leaders.\n\n\"I regret this,\" he said, answering a question from an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit.\n\nFrance \"has included women's right to abortion, the freedom of decision on one's own body, into its Constitution,\" he said, adding France defends \"this vision of equality between women and men.\"\n\n\"It's not a vision that's shared across all the political spectrum,\" Macron told the Italian reporter. \"I regret it, but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people.\"\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- European Council President Ursula von der Leyen is praising the agreement reached on guaranteeing a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using profits from frozen Russian central bank assets held in Europe.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a Group of Seven summit Thursday, von der Leyen said it sends a message to Ukraine but also to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"It is a strong signal that we are sending to Ukraine that we will support Ukraine in its fight for freedom for as long as it takes,\" she said. \"It is also a strong signal to Putin that Putin cannot outlast us.\"\n\nLeaders reached agreement on the loan deal as the summit opened.\n\nBARI, Italy -- The leaders of Ukraine and Japan have signed a 10-year agreement under which Japan will provide assistance in the fields of security, defense, humanitarian aid, reconstruction and technical and financial support.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio signed the accord on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in southern Italy on Thursday.\n\nZelenskyy said Japan would provide $4.5 billion for Ukraine this year. A text of the deal released by the Japanese Embassy in Italy said Japan has committed and provided more than $12 billion in financial, humanitarian and other assistance since March 2022.\n\nUnder the agreement, Japan will support Ukraine with the provision of non-lethal equipment and goods, cooperate in the field of intelligence and provide support in reconstruction and recovery, as well as providing assistance in the medical and health fields, among others.\n\n\"For Japan, this type of agreement and this level of support is a breakthrough,\" Zelenskyy wrote on the social media platform X. \"We see this and thank Japan for its unwavering solidarity with our country and people.\"\n\nBARI, Italy -- Italy's center-left opposition is crying foul over reported attempts by Premier Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government to water down a reference to abortion in the final document of the Group of Seven leaders.\n\nThe ANSA news agency, citing a draft Thursday, said there was no reference at all to abortion. That stands in contrast to the 2023 G7 summit in Hiroshima where Japan expressed a commitment to provide access to safe and legal abortion to women and girls, and pledged to defend gender equality and rights of LGBTQ people.\n\nAccording to ANSA, this year's text says the G7 \"repeats our commitment expressed in the final communique of the G7 of Hiroshima for a universal, adequate and sustainable access to health services for women, including the right to reproduction.\"\n\nMeloni, who campaigned on a \"God, Faith and Fatherland\" motto, has denied she is rolling back abortion rights, which have been legal in Italy since 1978. But the center-left opposition has warned that her initiatives are chipping away at those rights, including by giving pro-life groups access to women considering abortions.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the head of the Democratic Party Elly Shlein said the reported G7 text was a \"national embarrassment\" for putting into question a fundamental right for women.\n\nAsked about the controversy, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said he wasn't aware of the status of negotiations but said U.S. President Joe Biden \"doesn't change up his message based on who he's talking to, and nothing about that will change today.\"\n\nMeloni has forged a good alliance with Pope Francis, especially on their shared opposition to surrogacy and call for Italian women to have more babies to counteract one of the world's lowest birthrates. Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit when he spends the afternoon in Puglia on Friday.\n\nBERLIN -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has hailed as a \"historic step\" a deal by the Group of Seven leaders to lend $50 billion to Ukraine from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets.\n\nScholz called the deal \"a very strong commitment\" which also gives Ukrainians \"the courage to do what is now necessary for them to defend their independence and sovereignty.\"\n\nHe told reporters on the first day of the three-day G7 summit in Italy that the agreement is also \"a clear signal to the Russian president that he cannot simply take advantage of a situation and hope that he will succeed in winning this war\" because some countries supporting Ukraine are now facing fiscal problems.\n\nScholz also said that the leaders at the summit endorsed U.S. President Joe Biden's peace plan for the war in the Middle East.\n\nThe German Chancellor said \"now it is important that everyone implements it\" and called on Hamas \"to give the necessary approval so that this can now work.\"\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- The United States and European countries have agreed to lock up sanctioned Russian assets until Moscow pays reparations for invading Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.\n\nThe consensus clears the way for leaders to announce a $50 billion loan package for Ukraine during the Group of Seven summit that began Thursday in Italy.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. along with additional loans from other partners.\n\nThe first disbursements will be made this year, the official said, adding that it will take time for Ukraine to use all the money.\n\nThe U.S. official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' statement on Friday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will meet on Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\n-By Colleen Long, Darlene Superville and Zeke Miller\n\nLONDON -- Britain has announced new sanctions designed to degrade Russia's ability to wage war in Ukraine, targeting entities based in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey, as well as the Russian energy industry.\n\nThe sanctions announced at the start of Thursday's G7 summit apply to 50 companies and individuals involved in supplying munitions, machine tools, microelectronics, and logistics to the Russian military, together with ships transporting military goods from North Korea to Russia.\n\nBritain also said it was targeting the \"shadow fleet\" of ships used to circumvent G7 sanctions on the Russia oil and natural gas industry. The U.K. Foreign Office said this is particularly important because taxes on oil production accounted for 31% of the Russian government's revenue last year.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement that the U.K. \"will always stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in its fight for freedom.''\n\nSunak added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"must lose, and cutting off his ability to fund a prolonged conflict is absolutely vital.\"\n\nBARI, Italy -- European Council President Charles Michel says the Group of Seven summit would focus on four major challenges including financial support for Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, migration, and relations with Africa.\n\nOn Ukraine, Michel said at Thursday's start of the Group of Seven summit that \"we want to make decisions to provide more immediate financial support for Ukraine so that they can defend themselves.\"\n\nThe G7 meeting opened with an agreement on a US proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine with frozen Russian assets.\n\nSpeaking of the ongoing war in Gaza, Michel said the main goals were an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, humanitarian access to Gaza and relaunching \"a political track for making possible the two-state solution as soon as possible.\"\n\nDespite mounting international pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear he opposes the creation of a Palestinian state in any postwar scenario.\n\nOn migration, Michel said the focus was to create a \"coalition to fight against the smugglers, the criminal groups\" which were abusing vulnerable people \"to make money and to destabilize regions and countries across the world.\"\n\nMichel said African countries were tackling both poverty and the consequences of climate change and need access to capital, adding that building partnerships must be \"based on trust, based on respect, based on mutual confidence.\"\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- U.S. officials say that Italy is joining a rail corridor project in Africa as part of a collaborative effort by the Group of Seven nations to fund infrastructure projects.\n\nThe Lobito corridor is a railway line that will connect southern and central Africa. Not just railway, the project will also bring telecommunication cables and other infrastructure to the region.\n\nIt's projected eventually to go from Angola to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe investment project is meant to serve as an alternative to China's development efforts, which the U.S. and its allies say China uses to exert influence on developing nations.\n\nBARI, Italy -- Pope Francis will be meeting a series of world leaders on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in southern Italy.\n\nFrancis, who will be the first pope to address a G7 summit, will kick off his bilateral talks shortly after arriving at the summit location. He will meet Friday with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva.\n\nThe pope has previously met with Zelenskyy but caused a stir earlier this year when he said that Ukraine should have the \"courage of the white flag\" to negotiate an end of the war with Russia. Kyiv summoned the Holy See ambassador to complain.\n\nAfter delivering a speech at the G7 summit, the pope will continue his meetings with Kenyan President William Ruto, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune.\n\nBARI, Italy -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni says the location of the Group of Seven summit in southern Italy's Puglia region was chosen to send a message that the seven leading democracies want to \"strengthen dialogue with the nations of the global south.\"\n\nIn welcoming remarks at Thursday's start of the summit, Meloni said the meeting's agenda was wide-ranging, tackling topics including conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, creating \"solid and controllable supply chains,\" and the advent of artificial intelligence. The meeting will also focus on Africa and migration.\n\nMeloni said the G7 was \"not a fortress closed in itself\" but rather \"an offer of values that we open to the world.\"\n\nThe Italian premier called the region of Puglia \"historically a bridge between West and East,\" while the summit logo, a stylized depiction of an olive tree with roots and seven olives, depicts the collaboration of nations to tackle global challenges.\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni is greeting leaders of the Group of Seven as they arrive for a summit dominated by pledges of new assistance to help Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nStanding in front of one of Puglia's famed olive trees and under a canopy to guard against the sun, Meloni welcomed first British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and then German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nAhead of the summit, negotiators reached a deal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets held in the European Union as collateral.\n\nThe venue for the summit is Borgo Egnazai, a new luxury resort built to look like one of Puglia's medieval white-washed towns, complete with narrow streets, villas and a central piazza.\n\nBARI, Italy -- Officials say the world's seven wealthiest democracies have agreed on lending Ukraine up to $50 billion using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nDiplomats confirmed the agreement, which was struck before Thursday's start of the three-day G7 summit that brings together Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also sign a bilateral security agreement during the summit.\n\nEuropean officials have resisted confiscating the assets, citing legal and financial stability concerns. But the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. would issue Ukraine the $50 billion loan using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nLONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is announcing up to 242 million pounds in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine as Group of Seven leaders gather for a summit overshadowed by war.\n\nSunak is taking time out from the U.K. election campaign to attend Thursday's gathering in southern Italy.\n\nThe U.K. government says the money will go towards \"immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs\" in Ukraine. Sunak has also thrown his support behind a plan to use interest from seized Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild.\n\nSunak said the war is at a \"critical moment\" and Ukraine's allies \"must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\"\n\nThe U.K. has pledged 12.5 billion pounds to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. That includes 7.6 billion pounds worth of military assistance.\n\nSunak is battling to keep his job after the U.K. election on July 4, with opinion polls putting his Conservatives far behind the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Keir Starmer says he will keep up the United Kingdom's strong support for Ukraine if he becomes prime minister.\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- Madonna and the Beckhams have reportedly stayed there, and Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake got married there.\n\nBorgo Egnazia in Italy's southern Puglia region has certainly had its share of star power and on Thursday hosts another set of VIP guests: the leaders of the world's industrialized democracies.\n\nBut the venue for the Group of Seven summit is also something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgo_Egnazia", "type":

to help Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 announced it was freezing Russian central bank assets in 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, Trudeau commended the G7 for the announcement.\n\n\"Canada's actually the first country to announce $5 billion of that will be a Canadian contribution,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy thanked Trudeau \"for your loud voice\" in support of Ukraine.\n\nA government source not authorized to discuss matters publicly said Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was making calls last month to her G7 counterparts to drum up support for an agreement to use the assets to deliver more financial help to Ukraine.\n\nAs leaders announced the increased support on Thursday, Canada joined the U.S. and the U.K. in delivering a stark warning over Russian interference in Moldova, which neighbours Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"},

deal to use Russian assets for Ukraine, seeks to counter China", "body": "The plan involves a US$50 billion loan to help Ukraine fight Russia using the interest earned on profits from Moscow\u2019s frozen assets\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven major democracies started their annual summit on Thursday, many of them under a cloud at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they seek to help Ukraine and counter China\u2019s economic ambitions.\n\nHeading into two days of talks, diplomats said a deal had been agreed in principle on plans to issue US$50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\n\nThe loan would be secured against the future profits from interest on US$325 billion of Russian central bank assets frozen by Western allies.\n\n\u201cGood news from the G7: another US$50 billion for Ukraine,\u201d German Finance Minister Christian Lindner wrote on X.\n\n\u201cWe are using interest from frozen assets for this \u2013 a smart instrument that shows [Russian President Vladimir] Putin our unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets.\n\n\u201cNow we are working on the details.\u201d\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China\u2019s industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\u201d Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations \u2013 the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada \u2013 face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority.\n\nUS President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month and French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country\u2019s parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort, where they will spend the next two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nFor a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday afternoon, after which he will sign a new, long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden.\n\nA person close to the talks said the point of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state \u2013 a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November.Packed Agenda\n\nBiden\u2019s goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president\u2019s last summit given the looming re-election battle.\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial overcapacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\u201cThe G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\u201d he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to numerous outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.\n\nReporting by Reuters, Agence France-Presse,

leaders will also discuss relations with China in the context of the diversification of the supply of resources.\n\nThey will also explore new methods for African development, including Italy's \"Mattei Plan,\" focusing on equal and mutually beneficial partnerships.\n\n- High-Level attendance at Summit\n\nUS President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and many others are expected to participate in the meeting.\n\nSeveral leaders, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Catholic spiritual leader Pope Francis, invited by Italy will also attend the summit.\n\nErdogan is expected to attend sessions on Africa, the Mediterranean, AI and energy on the second day of the summit, and will also hold bilateral meetings on the margins of the summit.\n\n- Tight security measures\n\nSecurity measures are already in place at Borgo Egnazia for the G7 summit, with Italy increasing controls at all border crossings and intensifying security along its borders on June 5-18.\n\nBorgo Egnazia has been declared a \"high-security zone\" by Italian authorities, with a security cordon in place to prevent unauthorized access except for official and authorized delegations.\n\nUnsuitable conditions of a cruise ship, which will accommodate approximately 2,600 security officers on duty in Brindisi, the arrival city of the G7 leaders, have become the subject of criticism in the Italian press.\n\nThe uncleanliness of the beds and toilets on the ship, as well as the lack of clean water from the taps, have prompted reactions from security units.\n\nDuring the summit on June 13-15, anti-G7 protest demonstrations are also expected to take place in different cities of the Puglia Region, such as Brindisi and Bari.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piri_medya_a_s@yenisafak.com", "name": "Piri

Zelenskiy will also sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden later in the day.\n\nThe G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300 billion of impounded Russian funds.\n\nThe technical details are to be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters. The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year.\n\nThe United States had agreed to provide up to $50 billion itself, a senior U.S. official said, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November's election, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nRussia regards attempts by the West to take income from its frozen assets as criminal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday, adding that Moscow's response would be very painful for the European Union.\n\nMany of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they also seek to counter China's economic ambitions.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European parliament elections, leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that may undermine their authority.\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year.\n\nBiden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power in a national election next month, while French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing Mediterranean sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nThe G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers around the world such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray, Andrea Shalal, Thomas Escritt and John IrishWriting by Crispian Balmer and Keith WeirEditing by Christina Fincher, Ros Russell

Meloni is fresh off a strong showing in the European Parliamentary elections that set her and the far-right Brothers of Italy as a potential bridge-maker in Europe.\n\n\"The G7 is still very relevant,\" said Paul Samson, the president of the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They have some coherence that is rare out there right now.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau will kick-start the summit by attending several working sessions including in two on Ukraine, one session on Africa, Climate Change and Development and one on the Middle East.\n\nTrudeau will also hold bilateral meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy, who has been specially invited to participate in the G7.\n\n\"The G7 ought to have urgency and this is one of the things we will look for,\" said Braun.\n\nCanadian government officials have said that in addition to talking about the two wars, Trudeau also intends to bring up artificial intelligence, misinformation and foreign interference, the energy transition and fight against climate change while in Italy.\n\nConsensus on frozen Russian assets\n\nEven before the G7 began, U.S. officials were trying to get European allies on board with a plan to turn frozen Russian assets into further support Ukraine.\n\n\"This could be a game changer, especially if it is done rapidly and Ukraine is able to use those funds both in order to keep its economy afloat to build the military industries of its own, and to be able to pay the troops to be able to better recruit and so on,\" said Braun.\n\nWestern allies seized an estimated nearly $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets shortly after the invasion in February 2022, and it's estimated those assets are generating billions of dollars in interest every year.\n\nOne proposal being pitched by the United States is to offer a $50 billion dollar loan to Ukraine, guaranteed by the future interest accrued on those frozen Russian assets.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" White House spokesperson John Kirby said Tuesday.\n\nBut most of that money is in the European Union where leaders are not all on side with the U.S. proposal. There is concern among some European allies about possible legal ramifications, and the potential impact on the Euro.\n\n\"There's a huge debate around that and the G7 is divided,\" said Samson. \"The idea of using $50 billion leveraged out of the total assets is possible, but that seems to me unlikely to get the final approval at this summit.\"\n\nCanada, meanwhile, appears on side with the idea. Government officials speaking on background before the summit got underway told reporters this is something Canada thinks is \"incredibly important,\" and a move government officials, including the Deputy Prime Minister, have been working \"very hard at.\"\n\n\"Canada would be fully aligned with those that want to take the strongest line,\" said Samson.\n\nThese conversations will happen with Zelenskyy in the room, which experts say is a recognition that what is happening in Ukraine is not just a regional problem, but an attack on democratic values and global security.\n\nConsensus on the Middle East\n\nCanadian government officials have framed the G7 summit as an important moment to consider the impact of the crisis in Gaza and the broader questions of regional stability.\n\nThe European Union and G7 nations - the United States, Italy, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany - recently released a joint leaders' statement endorsing the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe statement was issued in response to a comprehensive U.S. peace deal released by Biden on May 31 which calls for an immediate six-week ceasefire, the release of all hostages, a sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for distribution throughout Gaza and an enduring end to the crisis.\n\nCanada has already stated its strong support for the Biden peace plan.\n\n\"Canada has been calling for an immediate ceasefire, an urgent increase in unhindered humanitarian assistance, and the release of all hostages,\" Trudeau said in a post on social media platform X the day the plan was released.\n\n\"The proposal put forward by (Biden) is an opportunity to end the suffering and return to a path to peace. All parties must seize it.\"\n\nDespite that joint statement, some experts are not optimistic that a consensus on a path forward can be achieved this week while in Italy.\n\n\"The situation is rather complex because now we have many countries in the world that are on one page and a smaller set of countries on a different page,\" said Dani Belo at the Norman Patterson School of International Affairs. \"It becomes quite a challenge to also bring together and harmonize all of these different interests.\"\n\nExperts point out that the world leaders have different opinions on a multitude of fronts involving the conflict from Ireland, Norway and Spain recently recognizing the State of Palestine, to the United States and France's drastically different reactions to the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to seek warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the leaders of Hamas. France said it supports the ICC and its fight against impunity, while the United States called the international tribunal's attempts to prosecute Netanyahu \"outrageous.\"\n\n\"We're in this sort of very complicated situation where there are competing agendas and not many people are willing to actually arrive at a solution,\" said Errol Mendes, an international law professor at the University of Ottawa. \"There has to be some out of the box thinking if there's going to be progress.\"\n\nQuestions about how a ceasefire and ultimately peace can be achieved are likely to come up on Thursday when leaders meet for a working session focused on the Middle East. Speaking ahead of the summit, Canadian officials would not say what they hope to achieve out of this meeting.\n\nWhat else to watch for?\n\nExperts anticipate that domestic politics may play into this year's G7 summit more than before, bringing a unique dynamic to the meeting. The leaders of France, Britain and the United States are all in the midst of election campaigns, with Canada's election scheduled to happen in less than a year and a half.\n\n\"Now we have the complication that some of them are now in danger of actually not being leaders anymore because of the pressing catastrophic results of the European elections,\" said Mendes.\n\nIn addition to the leaders of the G7 nations, Argentina, Brazil, India and Ukraine, among others, were invited to participate in the annual meeting.\n\nThe meeting in Italy marks the first time Trudeau and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be together since the prime minister said credible intelligence linked the death of Canadian Hardeep Singh Nijjar to the Indian government.\n\nIndia has denied any involvement in the case.\n\nNijjar, who had long advocated for the creation of the Sikh country called Khalistan, was shot dead in June 2023 outside his Surrey, B.C. temple. Four Indian nationals have been accused of the activist's murder and already appeared in court.\n\nCanada-India relations were already frosty, but worsened after Canada linked New Delhi to the murder. The Canadian government paused trade talks with India a month before Trudeau publicly made the link.\n\nThough the two have no meeting scheduled, they will be at the same summit, attending the same working sessions, dinners and luncheons.\n\nMendes believes Modi's recent loss of his majority government could help warm up relations between the two leaders.\n\n\"Now he has to go into a coalition with people who are far less authoritarian than he is,\" he said. \"Part of the reason those things happened with the assassination in Canada was the feeling that he has so much power in India and that India is becoming such a rising star that he can basically treat Canada the way China used to.\"\n\nTrudeau will attend a Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland this weekend before returning to Canada.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5,

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean KilpatrickSAVELLETRI DI FASANO, Italy - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada is prepared to contribute $5 billion toward a loan to Ukraine that will be based on future revenue from frozen Russian assets. Leaders of the G7 countries have agreed to engineer a US$50-billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral. The news comes on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit taking place in Apulia, Italy. The three-day summit is an opportunity for collaboration among the leaders of the wealthy democracies - France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan. Canada has been heavily involved in the U.S.-led push to use the frozen assets to help Ukraine. The G7 announced it was freezing Russian central bank assets in 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, Trudeau commended the G7 for the announcement. \"Canada's actually the first country to announce $5 billion of that will be a Canadian contribution,\" he said. Zelenskyy thanked Trudeau \"for your loud voice\" in support of Ukraine. A government source not authorized to discuss matters publicly said Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was making calls last month to her G7 counterparts to drum up support for an agreement to use the assets to deliver more financial help to Ukraine. As leaders announced the increased support on Thursday, Canada joined the U.S. and the U.K. in delivering a stark warning over Russian interference in Moldova, which neighbours Ukraine. The three countries said in a statement that Russian actors are \"carrying out a plot to influence outcomes\" of the country's upcoming presidential election this fall. \"They intend to incite protests in Moldova should a pro-Russia candidate not win,\" the statement said. \"They seek to foment negative public perceptions of Western governments, Moldova's incumbent leadership and Moldova's potential for EU integration, while degrading public confidence in Moldova's ability to secure itself and maintain rule of law\" The statement said the three countries have full confidence in Moldova's ability to manage the threats, and they are taking measures to support the efforts. \"By revealing the Kremlin's plot, we are making it clear to Moscow that we stand for free and fair elections and will not tolerate its attempts to meddle and undermine democratic processes,\" it said. Canada has also announced sanctions against 11 people and 16 entities connected to Russia's \"military-industrial complex,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a news release. That includes entities involved in circumventing sanctions on Russian oil. Trudeau held meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on the first day of the summit. He is also set to participate in working sessions with other leaders on collaboration with Africa, climate change, the Middle East and Ukraine. Trudeau is headed to Switzerland on Saturday to attend a summit on Ukraine, where a larger group of countries will meet to discuss a future path to peace.

The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year.\n\nA senior U.S. official said the United States had agreed to provide up to $50 billion itself, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nThe aim of the deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority.\n\nThe G7 leaders also expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit.\n\nIn addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, \"in line with their obligations under international law\".\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\nThe G7 may have a very different complexion next year.\n\nBiden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month. French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nLeaders of the G7 countries have agreed to engineer a US$50-billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering the loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA senior government source told the Canadian Press that Canada is prepared to contribute $5 billion toward a loan to Ukraine that will be based on future revenue from frozen Russian assets\n\nThe source, who is not being named because they are not authorized to discuss details publicly, says G7 leaders are finalizing details of the loan.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\nThe three-day summit is an opportunity for collaboration among the leaders of the wealthy democracies -- France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan.\n\nUkraine is expected to be a major agenda item for the leaders as the U.S. pushes to reach an agreement on Russian assets.\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau is scheduled to have meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nHe is also set to participate in working sessions with other leaders on collaboration with Africa, climate change, the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\nTrudeau is headed to Switzerland on Saturday to attend a summit on Ukraine, where a larger group of countries will meet to discuss a future path to peace.",

The G8's 'shrinkage' to G7 in March 2014 following the coup in Ukraine was a defining moment that signalled that there wasn't going to be any post-cold war peace dividend. The G7 that was conceived as a group of countries charioting the world economy ended up as the vehicle of big-power rivalry to preserve the US' global hegemony. Isolating Russia -- and lately, China, too -- became its leitmotif.\n\nWith the failure of the western project to isolate Russia, the G7 is meandering and lost its sense of direction. Italy, the G7 summit's rotating host this year, has made AI a key issue in the summit. And Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni invited by an unlikely guest, the pontiff, to make an unprecedented appearance at the G7 event at the fashionable Italian hotel Borgo Enyatia to advocate for the regulation of artificial intelligence, a technology he's called potentially harmful. Pope Francis was a chemist prior to entering seminary and will apparently draw on his scientific training to inform his stances. Italy under Meloni's leadership has increasingly scrutinised AI technology, and temporarily banned ChatGPT in March 2023, becoming the first western country to do so.\n\nEqually, G7 is desperate to go beyond a closed elite club of Western democracies by piloting an ambitious outreach and issued an unusually long list of invited leaders of the non-Western world to the summit. Aside Ukraine, Meloni has invited the leaders of India, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Algeria, Kenya and Mauritania to attend the meeting. What was the logic applied is impossible to tell.\n\nBut this is realpolitik and G7 is hoping to bridge the 'West vs. the Rest' hiatus in the line-up over the Ukraine crisis. In fact, the 'outreach guests' will witness tomorrow the nail-biting finale of a geopolitical drama, which forms the core of the G7 summit -- the months-long attempt by the group's leaders to make a decision on using dividends from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's military needs.\n\nTo recap, as part of the West's 'sanctions from hell' against Russia in 2022, the European Union, Canada, the US and Japan froze Moscow's assets in the western banks to the tune of $ 300 billion. (Some say, the actual figure is closer to $400 billion.) Only about $5-6 billion is located in the US, while $210 billion is stored in Europe, but the decision to use the proceeds from Russian assets was initiated by Washington with a hidden agenda to make Europe pay for the war's consequences.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the European members and Japan opposed the US pressure to include a provision on the use of income from frozen Russian assets in the joint G7 statement to be adopted. The CNN reported on Monday that American officials are still trying to agree on the \"most sensitive financial details\" of the plan for Russian assets, since the G7 countries are yet come to a consensus and discussions are continuing as regards \"the exact form of providing assistance, as well as guarantees for the return of these funds.\"\n\nThat said, don't be surprised if the recalcitrant Europeans ultimately fall in line. There is no question that the G7 move to appropriate Russian money in western banks was bad enough but to use the profits out of them to fund the needs of Ukraine is, to put it mildly, an act of brigandage.\n\nThe US gains if the current freeze in Russia-Europe ties reaches a point of no return, as Europe is sure to bear the brunt of Moscow's retaliation. If the G7 adopts such a move, it will weaken the global financial system. By brazenly violating international law, the G7 will be setting a precedent that undermines confidence in European institutions.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the G7 leaders explain to the 'outreach' countries, drawn largely out of BRICS, that Russia is an exception and such a practice will not one day be used against India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia or some other state.\n\nTo be sure, the spectre of the 16th summit meeting of BRICS at Kazan (16-18 October) under the chairmanship of Russian President Vladimir Putin haunts the G7. Moscow has let it be known that if the past three years ended with the expansion of the BRICS, the new phase going forward will ensure that the participants in an expanded format create a viable structure in which the member countries work purposively to develop a viable structure .\n\nAn important topic at the BRICS summit meeting in Kazan will be the creation of a single currency within the grouping, which will significantly simplify and expand the economic relations of the member countries against the backdrop of mounting pressure from the West.\n\nSpeaking at the SPIEF conference in St. Petersburg last week, Putin announced that such an independent payment system would be created. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov later confirmed that a platform for payments in national currencies is being developed.\n\nThe BRICS countries have realised that the creation of a single currency has become a necessity today due to the ongoing sanctions from the US and the European Union. Lavrov noted that \"recent international events have thrown off the masks\" of the West, which has tried to impose its own values on other countries under the guise of universal ones and replace equal dialogue with \"narrow coalitions\" that assign the right to speak on behalf of the whole world.\n\nBRICS, Lavrov underscored, implies a completely opposite type of partnership -- that is, anything but a bloc structure, and on the contrary, a fundamentally open format, which involves working only in those areas that are of mutual interest to all participants, big and small. Reports suggest that around 30 countries have sought BRICS membership.\n\nMeanwhile, in 'systemic' terms, G7 is entering uncharted waters. Far-right parties are storming the power centres of Europe. With an eye on the G7 summit, Politico wrote: \"Dream on. The G7 summit in the southern Italian coastal resort of Borgo Egnazia features arguably the weakest gathering of leaders the group has mustered for years. Most of the attendees are distracted by elections or domestic crises, disillusioned by years in office, or clinging desperately to power.\n\n\"France's Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Rishi Sunak are both fighting snap election campaigns they called in last-ditch efforts to reverse their flagging fortunes.\n\n\"Germany's Olaf Scholz was humiliated by far-right nationalists in last weekend's EU Parliament election and could soon be toppled himself.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau, prime minister for nine years in Canada, has spoken openly about quitting his \"crazy\" job.\n\n\"Japan's Fumio Kishida is enduring his lowest personal ratings ahead of a leadership contest later this year.\n\n\"And then there's Joe Biden.\n\n\"The 81-year-old U.S. president's son, Hunter, was found guilty of gun charges on Tuesday, barely two weeks before his father's first crucial debate with a resurgent Donald Trump in a presidential campaign the Democrat is in serious danger of losing.\"\n\nAbove all, the angst in the European mind is palpable that if Trump wins in a democracy-altering climax in the November election, he may not even have time or patience to tolerate an archaic forum like G7. Surveying the bleak landscape, it comes as no surprise that Meloni took matters in her hands and decided to use the summit to her purposes by designing an agenda that cleaved to Italy's strategic interests -- Africa, migration and the Mediterranean.\n\nfrom https://www.indianpunchline.com/the-g7-loses-ground-to-brics/", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

I don't expect leaders to say...(anything against it).\" A person close to the talks said the point of deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November.\n\nPACKED AGENDA\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given the looming re-election battle.\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

MAXPPP - Nicolas Cleuet/Le Pictorium\n\nTous les jours, Midi Libre fait le point sur la situation en Ukraine. Ce jeudi 13 juin 2024, d\u00e9couvrez les derni\u00e8res actualit\u00e9s autour de ce conflit.\n\nThe leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries arrived in Italy on Thursday for their annual summit during which they will seek to strengthen their support for Ukraine and present a united front against the China's political and economic ambitions. Ahead of two days of talks, diplomats said an agreement in principle had been reached on the plan to grant a $50 billion loan to Kiev using the interests of Russian sovereign assets frozen immediately after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"I think that we will have decided on the main axes of this project, but that certain details will have to be settled by experts according to a precise timetable\", said Jake Sullivan, White House national security adviser. A senior European official confirmed the existence of an agreement in principle. \"I think it's done\", he said. &quot ;Everything should be fine. I don't expect leaders to say... (anything against). The aim, according to a person familiar with the discussions, is to ensure the deal can work for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state. A way of responding to concerns linked to a possible return to power of Donald Trump, considered less favorable to kyiv.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that over the course of these two days we can have discussions that will lead to on concrete and measurable results\", Italian Council President Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests at the start of their discussions in a luxury hotel in the Puglia region in southern Italy. While Giorgia Meloni is buoyed by her success in the European legislative elections, most leaders of the G7 member countries are facing difficulties at home. US President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle against Donald Trump for re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power in the July 4 national election and in France, President Emmanuel Macron faces earthquake politics caused by his decision to dissolve the National Assembly. G7 leaders are also expected to express concern over China's high production levels, which they say are disrupting global supply chains and market stability. Washington on Wednesday extended sanctions against Moscow due to the war in Ukraine, in particular by targeting companies based in China that sell semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nJoe Biden probably hopes that these announcements, made on the eve of the G7 summit, will encourage Western allies to show more determination in confronting Beijing, particularly on its support for Russia. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky will participate for the second year in a row at the G7 summit, during which he is expected to sign a new long-term security agreement with Joe Biden. The leaders of countries not part of the G7 - such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria or Kenya - were invited to the summit. Pope Francis is expected to speak Friday on the risks posed by artificial intelligence and the potential it represents.\n\nUkraine on Thursday welcomed new US sanctions targeting Russia's war effort, saying they hit \"where it hurts\".\n\n\"These measures hit where it hurts. We particularly welcome the tough measures taken against Russia's defense industrial sector and its access to technology and resources abroad, said the head of the Ukrainian diplomacy, Dmytro Kouleba, on the social network\n\nAmerican President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement between their two countries on Thursday, intended to strengthen Ukraine's defenses against its invasion by Russia. Russia. This agreement, signed on the sidelines of a G7 summit in Italy, should constitute a further step towards Ukraine's accession to NATO, according to its terms. Volodimir Zelensky has long called for his country to join NATO, but the allies have so far refused to take this step as long as Ukraine is in conflict with Russia.\n\nUnder the terms of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, in the event of an attack against one of its 32 members, each member will consider this act as an armed attack directed against all members and will take the measures it deems necessary to come to the aid of the country attacked. The bilateral agreement signed Thursday provides that in the event of an attack against Ukraine, American and Ukrainian officials will meet within 24 hours to consult on the reaction to be had. and determine Ukraine's additional defense needs. \"The United States intends to provide long-term support in materiel, training and advice, intelligence, security, defense industry, #39;institutions and other types to develop Ukrainian security and defense forces capable of defending a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine and deterring future aggression\" , is it written in the agreement.",

The move clears the way for leaders to announce a $50 billion loan package for Kyiv at the Group of Seven summit, where President Joe Biden is set to sign a security agreement with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. and additional loans from other partners. The first disbursements will be made this year, but it will take time for Ukraine to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nThe leaders\u00b4 statement will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden will meet on Thursday with Zelenskyy to discuss a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia.\n\nIt comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield.\n\nBiden\u00b4s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the pact as a \"real marker\" of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden arrives to the G7 Summit in Borgo Egnazia, southern Italy, Thursday, June 13, 2024. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine.\"\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine\u00b4s defense against Russia\u00b4s invasion. That is a red line drawn by Biden, who does not want to have the U.S. pulled into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Moscow.\n\nScores of countries and organizations are set to meet over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss peace for Ukraine. Biden is not scheduled to attend the summit, a decision that has disappointed Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. instead.\n\nZelenskyy recently said the summit needs Biden\u00b4s participation because other leaders value the U.S. viewpoint. He said Biden\u00b4s absence \"will be only an applaud to Putin, a personal applaud to Putin.\"\n\nFrom left, European Council President Charles Michel, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, U.S. President Joe Biden, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen participate in a working session at the G7, Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Borgo Egnazia, Italy.

Leaders are keen to show action to back their stuanch words of support for Ukraine, as well as try and push for a Gaza ceasefire deal, while they can\n\nThe precarious position of most world leaders meant expectations for the summit remained low - with France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz facing an ascendant far-right - which has pushed Mr Macron inso a snap election, Canada's Justin Trudeau perceived to be fatigued by a lengthy premiership, and elections looming in the UK and US. As well as Japan's Fumio Kishida facing low approval ratings and fending off calls for his own snap ballot.\n\n\"There are two levels to the G7: what's the big narrative and what are the concrete deliverables - and on both counts, it looks like a very unlucky summit,\" said Natalie Tocci, head of the Italian Institute for International Affairs.\n\n\"If anything will come out of this summit, it's the fear of a catastrophe playing out before our eyes,\" Ms Tocci told the BBC.\n\nBut in a sign of her own bouyant position, Ms Meloni has also invited Pope Francis, Argentina's populist president Javier Milei, Brazil's left-wing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine - in an apparent bid to show an outwards-looking West that is determined to confront Russia's \"arsenal of autocracy\".\n\nIndia's Narendra Modi and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey were also invited, as well as three African presidents - Abdelmadjid Tebboune of Algeria, Kenya's William Ruto and Tunisia's Kais Saied.\n\nThe three-day summit's agenda carries clear signs of Ms Meloni, and her hard right Brothers of Italy party's domestic goals, with the initial focus on Africa, climate change and development mirroring her own desire to use Italy as an energy bridge between Africa and Europe, and to use investment in Africa as a tool to reduce irregular migration to Europe. Italy, along with Greece, has faced hundreds of thousands of arrivals by sea across the Mediterranean. The figure for Italy was 155,000 in 2023. The future of artificial intelligence (AI) is another topic on the agenda, with Ms Meloni worried about the imapct on the jobs market.\n\nIn her opening address, Ms Meloni called for \"concrete and measurable results\" out of the summit.\n\n\"The G7 is not a self-enclosed fortress, which needs to defend itself against others. It is a container of values, and we want to open to the world in order to have shared development and growth as our goal,\" she said.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU. Ms Meloni's party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election this past weekend than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. There are still issues domestically - brawl erupted in Italy's parliament on Wednesday over a controversial government bill that would give Italy's regions greater autonomy - but Ms Meloni 's position is secure.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the... G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\n\"With a G7 led by Italy and taking place in Italy, Meloni can enter with all her political strength,\" Giovanni Orsina, professor of political history at Rome's Luiss University, told Politico, adding: \"If she is skillful, she can end up with an important international success, managing to get the issues important to her on the agenda. Not many leaders are able to gain votes after two years governing.\"\n\nIn a sign of the ability Ms Meloni has to flex her political muscle, her office denied reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique - as a French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on topics including sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian foreign minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nElsewhere, Rishi Sunak announced \u00a3242m in new non-military aid to Ukraine, while Mr Biden planned to urge G7 allies to push Hamas into accepting a Gaza ceasefire proposal backed by Israel, and to discuss \"the continuing threat posed by Iran\".\n\nMr Zelensky was pushing for expedited fighter pilot deliveries and training for Ukrainian pilots, in addition to more air defences and long-range weapons, and was expected to sign security agreements with Japan and the US, echoing those agreed with the UK and more than a dozen other Nato allies.\n\nPope Francis, courting controversy of his own after being accused of repeating a homophobic slur during a closed-door meeting, is also set to become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, giving a speech on Friday on the promises and perils of AI, and is expected to appeal for peace in Gaza and Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_gregory@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Andy Gregory", "type": "author",

Kiev is set to use the money to strengthen its defence, pay for the reconstruction of infrastructure and fund the state budget.\n\nFinancing: the devil is in the details\n\nPlanning for the structure of the loan package has been under way for some time. The United States had originally campaigned in favour of collecting not only the interest income, but also the frozen assets themselves and using them to provide financial support to Kiev.\n\nThe US government says around $280 billion of Russian central bank money has been immobilized in Western countries due to sanctions imposed since the full-scale Russian attack on Ukraine more than two years ago. The bulk of the Russian money is within the European Union.\n\nThe Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear - by far the largest holder in the EU of frozen Russian central bank assets - recently said that it had collected around \u20ac4.4 billion ($4.7 billion) in interest in 2023.\n\nBut some European capitals had major reservations about using both the principle and the interest, resulting in the compromise in which the interest is used as collateral to pay off the loan.\n\nThe bloc's member states recently approved the use of interest income generated from Russian state assets to finance aid for Ukraine.\n\nUS steps in in case politics changes the loan picture\n\nOne of thorny issues is who would bear the credit risks if the EU sanctions on the assets could not be extended, for instance due to the veto of a member state. That would mean that the interest could no longer be used to pay off the loan.\n\nOn Thursday the US declared its willingness to bear the main burden of the multibillion-dollar loan, a high-ranking US government representative said on the sidelines of the summit, where the finance ministers of the seven advanced industrialized democracies - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - hammered out the details.\n\nThe US is willing to provide up to $50 billion, or the total amount of the loan to Kiev - the US official said.\n\nHowever, he emphasized: \"We will not be the only lenders.\" Others would also participate. The risk would be shared, as would the will to get the project off the ground. He did not provide any specific details. However, he signalled that the sum could end up being even higher.\n\nThe US government representative stressed that the loan would be financed from Russian funds in any case. And if there was peace, Russia would have to pay reparations for the damage it had caused, he said, which would be used to repay the loan.\n\nPutting up a united front important to the G7\n\n\"We remain determined to dispel any false notion that time is on Russia's side, that destroying infrastructure and livelihoods has no consequences for Russia, or that Russia can prevail by causing Ukraine to fail economically,\" the summit's draft final declaration said.\n\nAt the summit, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced another \u00a3242 million ($309 million) in bilateral assistance to Ukraine.\n\nLondon also issued 50 more sanctions targeting Russia's financial system and suppliers for Russian military supply chains. The United States issued several hundred new sanctions on Wednesday.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Zelensky will also sign a bilateral security agreement between the United States and Ukraine on the sidelines of the G7, the White House has said. Kiev has struck similar commitments with 15 countries, including Britain, France and Germany.\n\nBesides Zelensky, the leaders of Turkey, Brazil and India will also be attending the Italy talks. Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to take part in a G7 summit, after he was invited to address the risks posed by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe war in Gaza and tensions with China are also set to feature high on the agenda at the 28-villa luxury Borgo Egnazia resort, located to the south-east of the city of Bari in southern Italy's Apulia region. The hotel has previously played host to international celebrities such as Madonna, Justin Timberlake and the Beckhams.\n\nInternational crises were not the only elements at play in Italy\n\nThis could be Biden's final G7 summit, coming five months before he faces his predecessor and right-wing Republican rival Donald Trump in a US presidential contest that has Washington's allies on edge.\n\nEuropean leaders are under domestic political pressure, too.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will arrive after far-right parties made big gains in last weekend's European Parliament elections, raising questions about their countries' political environments.\n\nAnd, after 14 years of Conservative government in Britain, Sunak is expected to suffer a stinging defeat to the opposition Labour Party in the July 4 general election.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They will also be joined by the chiefs of the European Council and the European Commission.\n\nThe G7 host also has the discretion to invite guests from other countries for extended sessions. It's a practice that the grouping has increasingly turned to, as it has tried to present itself as a voice of more than just the wealthy West.

The U.S., with Canada's support, has proposed using the interest on roughly 200 billion euros in frozen Russian assets held mostly in Europe to secure a $50 billion US bank loan for ongoing support for Ukraine.\n\nI think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said about the discussions.\n\nThe Canadian announcement comes ahead of Trudeau's meeting with Zelenskyy Thursday in Italy.\n\nTrudeau first made the pitch to use seized Russian Central Bank assets in February during a G7 call, the government said.

The wars in Ukraine and Gaza, climate change and many other divisions loom over the meeting, which includes leaders from the European Union and Pope Francis.\n\nThe RCMP said last month it has frozen $140 million (new window) in Russian assets in Canada since February 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Global Affairs Canada said it also ordered the seizure of a Russian plane (new window) and a company believed to be tied to a Russian oligarch (new window).\n\nThe recent federal budget said Canada is committed to exploring with allies possible legal mechanisms to make full use of these assets.\n\nUkraine is in dire need of more weapons, ammunition and training after a long lull in deliveries from Washington. U.S. Congress approved a $61 billion US military aid package for Ukraine last month, but only after political conflict within the Republican Party delayed the package for six months.\n\nDefence Minister Bill Blair met with the Ukraine Defence Contact Group in Belgium on Thursday and announced plans to send the first shipment of 2,000 decommissioned rocket motors used by the Royal Canadian Air Force to Ukraine.\n\nCanada will also donate close to 30 Nanuk remote weapons systems, which is a remotely controlled weapons station that can be used on armoured vehicles. Blair also said the government is sending more than 130,000 rounds of small arms ammunition to Ukrainian troops.\n\nTrudeau is taking part in a series of working sessions on Thursday with G7 leaders about the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, along with development in Africa and climate change.\n\nHe's scheduled to have bilateral meetings with French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor

These include UAE's Mohamed bin Zayed, Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Jordan's King Abdullah II and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nNotable absentees are Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who, according to a list seen by Al Jazeera, had been invited.\n\nThe timing could not be better for Meloni, who will preside over the summit as Europe's rising star following her far-right party's victory at the recent European Parliament elections that saw a turn to the right across the continent.\n\n\"I'm proud to be heading to the G7 with the strongest government of all,\" the prime minister said on her way to Apulia.\n\nAfrica and the Mediterranean - two key national security issues - will feature prominently in the summit. Meloni is expected to expand her flagship foreign policy, the so-called Mattei Plan. The project aims to position Italy as a major energy hub between Europe and the African continent in the hope of boosting growth in Africa and, in turn, curbing immigration to Europe.\n\nSupport for Ukraine is also top of the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to arrive on the summit's first day for two sessions dedicated to the war-torn country. The G7's most anticipated outcome is an agreement over a $50bn loan for Ukraine backed by profits accrued on Russian assets frozen in the West soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. An Italian source told Al Jazeera there was political will to announce a deal at the summit, even if some technical issues need ironing out.\n\nSuch an agreement, the source said, would send a strong message of unity with Kyiv at a time when Ukrainian soldiers are on the back foot, and Moscow is making steady gains in the east and north of the country. A potential change in the White House in the US's November elections has added to the urgency.\n\nAnother session is on the Middle East, where Israel's war on Gaza is expected to dominate talks. Observers say leaders are likely to reiterate past positions, from calling on Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal laid out by US President Joe Biden, to acknowledging the importance of a two-state solution for peace in the region.\n\nAmong the guests, there will also be Pope Francis - marking the first time a pontiff has been invited to the summit - for a session dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI). Other specific sessions will then be on migration, financial issues and the situation in the Asia Pacific.\n\nA final statement is expected on Saturday. This is usually a document that indicates the direction the group's members intend to follow - crafting future policies while offering the rest of the world a window into their priorities.", "source":

Then there's the backdrop: Over half of the leaders are facing elections in the coming weeks and months, and the odds are slim that the group will look the same when they next meet in Canada. Does that provide a sense of urgency or does it present a roadblock for the leaders of the West? Here's a look inside the numbers that will frame the coming days.\n\nThe G7 has an unusually long guest list for the 2024 summit: thirteen world leaders, including the pope. The 2021 summit had four guests, the 2022 summit had six, and the 2023 summit had nine. The bulge in the number of guests reflects the nature and scale of challenges on the G7's agenda, from wars in Europe and the Middle East to regulating artificial intelligence (AI) to countering China's manufacturing overcapacity to addressing climate change. Notably, five of the 2024 guests (India, Brazil, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) are members of the developing country grouping known as BRICS. While the G7 is trying to show these countries that it can still work together on global challenges, the guests are also eager to indicate that BRICS is not an \"anti-West\" coalition -- yet.\n\nHow did the United States outpace the rest of the G7 in gross domestic product (GDP) growth after the pandemic? There's no one answer. Extraordinary fiscal stimulus, flexible labor markets, productivity growth, and technological leadership, including in AI, all played a role. But the bottom line is that the United States is the fastest-growing advanced economy in the world -- and it is not particularly close. To put the US surge in perspective, in the third quarter of 2023 the United States had the same GDP growth as China: 5 percent. That statistic would have been improbable just a few years ago.\n\nEnforcing sanctions and other economic measures against Russia will be one of the main objectives of the G7 summit. Last year, Russia reported a 28.3 percent drop in total exports from 2022. Russian media outlets cited sanctions as an important reason for this decline, specifically the December 2022 European Union (EU) ban on Russian crude oil sold above the G7 price cap. However, Russia has mitigated some of the price cap's effects by reorienting oil exports to Asia, mainly to China and India. Last month, G7 finance ministers and central bank governors issued a joint statement in which they reiterated their commitment to enforcing the price cap. At the upcoming summit, G7 members should commit to strengthening enforcement with third countries such as China and India to further reduce Russia's commodity revenues and ability to fund its war in Ukraine.\n\nInflation across the G7 reached its lowest point since April 2021 by January this year. In the lead-up to the summit this week, the US Federal Open Market Committee held rates steady and emphasized the importance of returning inflation to 2 percent. This follows the first rate cuts last week from the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank. For Germany and the United Kingdom, both of which experienced a technical recession at some point in 2023, looser monetary policy is long-awaited. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan faces a more complicated task in managing deflation. But the US Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target still appears to be a distant objective -- meaning the United States' much-anticipated loosening may be put off a bit longer.\n\nAt last year's G7 summit, the leaders pledged both to \"drive the transition to clean energy economies of the future through cooperation within and beyond the G7\" and to coordinate their approaches to de-risking. The past year suggests that it may be difficult to make progress on these somewhat contradictory objectives. With Chinese manufacturing overcapacity flooding markets, G7 countries have ample incentive to follow the Biden administration in levying higher tariffs on Chinese goods, especially those that compete with infant green energy industries, such as lithium batteries and electric vehicles. The European Commission did just that on Wednesday, proposing higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. What may be beneficial to their domestic industries is not necessarily beneficial to the green transition overall, and coordination on these approaches will be difficult. G7 nations have proven their ability to coordinate since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but they are still economic competitors.\n\nHave you ever wondered why it takes your bank account two to five days to show a transaction? Banks and other financial institutions are connected to each other and to a central bank through a payments network, a complicated pipeline consisting of messaging and settlement infrastructure that enables money to move. Usually, your paycheck or rent payments go through a service that is not instantaneous. However, in the past decade, some payments networks have become close to immediate, which allows users to see their transactions settled in less than a day -- sometimes in as little as a few seconds.\n\nThis type of infrastructure is usually referred to as a fast payments system. There are many economic benefits to fast payments, since they are accessible around the clock to users and can improve businesses' liquidity, reliability, and usability. While the biggest networks of fast payments are outside of the G7, the group's member countries have also undertaken measures to create a fast payments system. As the graph above shows, the United Kingdom and Japan have been early adopters of fast payments systems; France, Italy, and Germany enabled their fast payments systems as part of the EU in 2018; and the United States and Canada trail on adoption. The development of a fast payments system is a marker of maturity, innovation, and modernization of the payments infrastructure in a country.\n\nCan the G7 figure out a way to provide fifty billion dollars to Ukraine using immobilized Russian assets? This is perhaps the biggest litmus test of the success of the summit's success. The issue of the assets has been a hot topic since the day they were blocked over two years ago. As we have long said, the fact that the majority of the money was in Europe (in Belgium's Euroclear) was going to be the determining factor. For two years, there's been little agreement on how to make the best use of the money. Earlier this year, there was small progress, with Europe agreeing to use the windfall profits so at least the yearly interest earned on the bulk of the $280 billion could be given to Ukraine. But for many who wanted full confiscation of the assets, that wasn't enough. Enter the US-led plan to pull forward future interest earnings over the next twenty years. It's a creative financial solution that is gaining momentum in the G7. The difference it could make is shown above.\n\nContributions from: Charles Lichfield, Mrugank Bhusari, Ryan Murphy, Josh Lipsky, Sophia Busch, Ananya Kumar, and Alisha Chhangani.\n\nResearch support from: Clara Falkenek, Gustavo Romero, and Konstantinos Mitsotakis.\n\nRelated Experts: Sophia Busch, Charles Lichfield, Mrugank Bhusari, Ryan Murphy, Josh Lipsky, Ananya Kumar, and Alisha Chhangani\n\nImage: The G7 Summit will be held in Borgo Egnazia (Fasano) in Apulia, on June 13-15, 2024.

The wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the threats posed by China's economic rise are high on the agenda.\n\nThe leaders, along with representatives of the European Union and selected guests, meet to discuss economic issues and major international policies. This year the summit's host, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, has also invited other top names including Pope Francis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.\n\nWhatever the leaders' disagreements on the issues, one feature of the summits tends to be a shared overall outlook. Their countries are major trading partners, and even if their share of global trade has declined, they account for about half of the world economy. They also share broadly similar views on trade, security and human rights, giving them enormous influence when they act in concert.\n\nA recent example of that common purpose is the war in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose defense against the Russian invasion of his country has been a rallying point for the G7, is another guest this year. Leaders at the summit are expected to announce fresh sanctions on Moscow.\n\nBy the same token, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is one of the group's most notable absentees.

Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow invaded its neighbour in 2022.\n\nThe political agreement was the centrepiece of the opening day in southern Italy of the annual summit of G7 leaders, attended for a second successive year by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nHe signed a new, long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden after signing a 10-year security accord with Japan, with Tokyo promising to provide Kyiv with US$4.5 billion this year - underlining continued strong backing from the West.\n\nCalling the frozen asset agreement a \"significant outcome\", Biden told reporters it was \"another reminder to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that we're not backing down\".\n\nThe G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some US$300 billion of impounded Russian funds, the bulk of which are blocked in the European Union.\n\nThe technical details will be finalised in the coming weeks, with the new cash expected to reach Kyiv by the end of this year thanks to contributions from all G7 states - the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Italy.\n\n\"This is a very clear commitment that should embolden the Ukrainians to do what they need to to defend their independence and sovereignty,\" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nThe aim of the deal is to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November's election, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nRussia regards attempts by the West to take income from its frozen assets as criminal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday, adding that Moscow's response would be very painful for the European Union.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, \"some changes are achievable, some are not\".\n\n\"The time for haggling is over,\" Sullivan said, while Israel has not officially announced its position on the truce and continues its offensive in the Palestinian territory.\n\nThe Italian prime minister, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the G7, also invited a dozen leaders from outside the group, including the presidents of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and Argentina, Javier Milei.\n\nMilei has bilateral meetings on Friday with Meloni and the French president, as well as the heads of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, and the World Bank, Ajay Banga.\n\nThe thematic sessions and numerous bilateral meetings will also address other issues, starting with tensions with China, one of Russia's main backers.\n\nThe United States and Europe accuse Beijing of flooding markets with low-priced subsidised products, particularly electric cars.\n\nAlso on the guest list are Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Jordan's King Abdullah II and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\n\nBut perhaps one of the most unexpected is 87-year-old Pope Francis, who this time is coming not only as a spiritual leader but also to give a talk on Friday on artificial intelligence and \"algorethics\" (the ethics of algorithms), an issue of concern to the Vatican.\n\nThe summit is being held at Borgo Egnazia, an exclusive resort 60 kilometres south of Bari, the regional capital, completely cut off from the outside world and also from journalists.\n\nThe resort, which mimics Italian architecture like a theme park, is Madonna's favourite on her trips to Italy and among other amenities has its own Michelin-starred restaurant.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atalayar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki",

Leaders are keen to show action to back their stuanch words of support for Ukraine, as well as try and push for a Gaza ceasefire deal, while they can\n\nThe precarious position of most world leaders meant expectations for the summit remained low - with France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz facing an ascendant far-right - which has pushed Mr Macron inso a snap election, Canada's Justin Trudeau perceived to be fatigued by a lengthy premiership, and elections looming in the UK and US. As well as Japan's Fumio Kishida facing low approval ratings and fending off calls for his own snap ballot.\n\n\"There are two levels to the G7: what's the big narrative and what are the concrete deliverables - and on both counts, it looks like a very unlucky summit,\" said Natalie Tocci, head of the Italian Institute for International Affairs.\n\n\"If anything will come out of this summit, it's the fear of a catastrophe playing out before our eyes,\" Ms Tocci told the BBC.\n\nBut in a sign of her own bouyant position, Ms Meloni has also invited Pope Francis, Argentina's populist president Javier Milei, Brazil's left-wing president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine - in an apparent bid to show an outwards-looking West that is determined to confront Russia's \"arsenal of autocracy\".\n\nIndia's Narendra Modi and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey were also invited, as well as three African presidents - Abdelmadjid Tebboune of Algeria, Kenya's William Ruto and Tunisia's Kais Saied.\n\nThe three-day summit's agenda carries clear signs of Ms Meloni, and her hard right Brothers of Italy party's domestic goals, with the initial focus on Africa, climate change and development mirroring her own desire to use Italy as an energy bridge between Africa and Europe, and to use investment in Africa as a tool to reduce irregular migration to Europe. Italy, along with Greece, has faced hundreds of thousands of arrivals by sea across the Mediterranean. The figure for Italy was 155,000 in 2023.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU. Ms Meloni's party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election this past weekend than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. There are still issues domestically - brawl erupted in Italy's parliament on Wednesday over a controversial government bill that would give Italy's regions greater autonomy - but Ms Meloni 's position is secure.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the... G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\n\"With a G7 led by Italy and taking place in Italy, Meloni can enter with all her political strength,\" Giovanni Orsina, professor of political history at Rome's Luiss University, told Politico, adding: \"If she is skillful, she can end up with an important international success, managing to get the issues important to her on the agenda. Not many leaders are able to gain votes after two years governing.\"\n\nIn a sign of the ability Ms Meloni has to flex her political muscle, her office denied reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique - as a French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on topics including sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian foreign minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nElsewhere, Rishi Sunak announced \u00a3242m in new non-military aid to Ukraine, while Mr Biden planned to urge G7 allies to push Hamas into accepting a Gaza ceasefire proposal backed by Israel, and to discuss \"the continuing threat posed by Iran\".\n\nMr Zelensky was pushing for expedited fighter pilot deliveries and training for Ukrainian pilots, in addition to more air defences and long-range weapons, and was expected to sign security agreements with Japan and the US, echoing those agreed with the UK and more than a dozen other Nato allies.\n\nPope Francis, courting controversy of his own after being accused of repeating a homophobic slur during a closed-door meeting, is also set to become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, giving a speech on Friday on the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, and was expected to appeal for peace in Gaza and Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni",

He will become the first pontiff ever to take part in a G7 summit.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, will attend a discussion today on the progress of the war and is expected to press for more help from Western allies.\n\nThe G7 leaders hope to bash out an agreement on using the profits from the interest on $300 billion (\u00a3235 billion) of frozen Russian central bank assets to help Kyiv in its fight against Putin's forces.\n\nAll of this will be taking part far from the gaze of the hundreds of journalists assigned to the event: they are being consigned to a media centre in the port of Bari, nearly 40 miles away from the summit venue.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_squires@yahoo.com", "name": "Nick Squires",

Meloni's hard-right party took nearly 29% of the vote in last weekend's European Parliament election, making her the only leader of a major Western European country to emerge from the ballots stronger.\n\nMeanwhile Biden is dealing with a contentious reelection campaign against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump, and a personal ordeal. On Tuesday, a day before departing for the summit, his son, Hunter, was found guilty on federal charges for possessing a gun while being addicted to drugs.\n\nStill, Biden came to the summit hoping to convince the group to provide a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using interest from Russian frozen assets, and deal with Chinese overcapacity in strategic green technologies, including electric vehicles.\n\nThe European Union signaled their support by announcing duties on Chinese EVs a day ahead of the summit, a move that echoed the Biden administration's steep tariff hike on Chinese EVs and other key sectors in May.\n\nBiden is also lending his support to key themes in Meloni's presidency - investing in Africa, international development, and climate change. Those topics were covered in the opening session of the G7 on Thursday, followed by discussions on the Gaza and Ukraine wars.\n\nGaza cease-fire\n\nWith cease-fire negotiations at a critical juncture, Biden could face tough questions from leaders on whether he is doing enough to pressure Israel to pause its military campaign, reduce civilian casualties and provide more aid for Palestinians.\n\nLeaders are \"focused on one thing overall; getting a cease-fire in place and getting the hostages home as part of that,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA as he spoke to reporters on board Air Force One en route to Italy. Biden has \"their full backing,\" Sullivan added.\n\nLeaders will also discuss increasing tension along the Israeli border with Lebanon, Sullivan told reporters Thursday morning.\n\n\"They'll compare notes on the continuing threat posed by Iran both with respect to its support for proxy forces and with respect to the Iranian nuclear program,\" he added.\n\nWhile the group has thrown its weight behind the cease-fire, G7 members are split on other Gaza-related issues, including the International Criminal Court's decision last month to seek arrest warrants for the leaders of Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe United States denounced the court's decision, and Britain called it \"unhelpful.\" France said it supports the court's \"fight against impunity,\" while Berlin said it would arrest Netanyahu on German soil should a warrant is released.\n\nSullivan dismissed a United Nations inquiry result released Wednesday that alleges both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes and grave violations of international law.\n\n\"We've made our position clear,\" he told VOA, referring to a review published in April by the State Department concluding that Israel's campaign did not violate international humanitarian law.\n\nRussian assets\n\nBiden is pushing G7 leaders to provide Kyiv with a loan of up to $50 billion that will be paid back to Western allies using interest income from the $280 billion Russian assets frozen in Western financial institutions, estimated at $3 billion a year, for 10 years or more.\n\nThe goal is a leaders declaration at the end of the summit, a \"framework that is not generic, that is quite specific in terms of what it would entail,\" Sullivan told VOA Wednesday. Core operational details would still need to be worked out, he added.\n\nIn April, Biden signed legislation to seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian assets that had been immobilized in U.S. financial institutions. The bulk of the money, though, $190 billion, is in Belgium, and much of the rest is in France and Germany.\n\n\"There's a tension here between a Biden administration ambition on an issue in which they do not have the final say, hitting against very staunch European fiscal conservatism and simply the mechanics of, how do you get something done in Europe in the week of European [parliamentary] elections,\" Kristine Berzina, managing director of Geostrategy North at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told VOA.\n\nAttending the summit for the second consecutive year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is advocating for the deal to pass. He and Biden will sign a separate bilateral security agreement outlining U.S. support for Ukraine and speak in a joint press conference Thursday evening.\n\nFrom Italy, Zelenskyy heads to Switzerland for a Ukraine peace conference over the weekend.\n\nAfrica, climate change and development\n\nMeloni, a far-right politician who once called for a naval blockade to prevent African migrants from crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, now wants to achieve the goal by bolstering international investments to the continent.\n\nMost of the nearly 261,000 migrants who crossed the Mediterranean Sea from northern Africa in 2023 entered Europe through Italy, according to the United Nations.\n\nShe has aligned her G7 presidency with this agenda, and the group is set to release a statement on providing debt relief for low- and middle-income countries, dealing with irregular migration and calling for more investments in Africa.\n\nThe G7 statement will reflect the Nairobi/Washington vision that Biden signed with Kenyan President William Ruto, Sullivan said.\n\nMeloni invited several African leaders as observers to the G7 meeting, including Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Tunisia's Kais Saied, Kenyan President William Ruto and Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, the president of Mauritania. The invitation follows the first Italy-Africa summit in Rome in January, where Meloni launched her investment initiative called the Mattei Plan for Africa.\n\nThe Mattei Plan has been integrated into the G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to mobilize $600 billion private infrastructure funding by 2027 as an alternative to Chin's Belt and Road initiative.\n\nOn climate change, the G7 has an uphill climb. None of the group's members are on track to meet their existing emission reduction targets for 2030 to align with the Paris Agreement goal, according to data compiled by Climate Analytics.", "source":

The wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the threats posed by China's economic rise are high on the agenda.\n\nThe leaders, along with representatives of the European Union and selected guests, meet to discuss economic issues and major international policies. This year the summit's host, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, has also invited other figures including Pope Francis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.\n\nWhatever the leaders' disagreements on the issues, one feature of the summits tends to be a shared overall outlook. Their countries are major trading partners, and even if their share of global trade has declined, they account for about half of the world economy. They also share broadly similar views on trade, security and human rights, giving them enormous influence when they act in concert.\n\nA recent example of that is the war in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose defense against the Russian invasion of his country has been a rallying point for the G7, is attending again this year.\n\nBy the same token, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is one of the group's most notable absentees.

(Scripps News)\n\nA lot is happening around the world, but Ukrainian flags outside of American homes serve as a reminder that the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a big issue.\n\nThe U.S.'s latest commitment has been locked in for weeks -- around $60 billion in U.S. taxpayer money will soon flow to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, there remains a concern that that is still not enough. The gathering of world leaders in the coming days in Europe is hoping to change that.\n\nThe G7 summit kicked off Thursday in Italy, where leaders from the Group of Seven nations -- U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom -- will meet Thursday through Saturday.\n\nA second global event is a Ukraine peace summit, which is taking place in Switzerland Saturday and Sunday. Around 90 countries are expected to be involved.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is in Italy attending the G7, and Vice President Kamala Harris is attending the peace summit.\n\nOver the next few days, news about the state of the war between Russia and Ukraine is expected.\n\n\"The conflict is effectively a stalemate on the ground. There are little movements here and there,\" said Lester Munson, an expert in international relations at the global affairs firm BGR Group.\n\nMunson recently told Scripps News that despite all of the American aid -- and global support -- right now, the war hasn't changed much, with Russia and Ukraine not gaining or retaking much territory as of late.\n\nWhile the gathering in Switzerland this weekend is meant to help chart a path toward peace, President Biden's meeting with the G7 is meant to help Ukraine win the war.\n\nThat involves President Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting Thursday and outlining what assistance looks like going forward.\n\nEurope\n\nG7 summit opens with deal to use Russian assets for Ukraine AP via Scripps News 4:17 AM, Jun 13, 2024\n\nAccording to National Security adviser Jake Sullivan, the G7 will look at ways that Europe can use the profits from frozen Russian assets to give even more assistance to Ukraine.\n\n\"Our view is that Ukraine's security is central to Europe's security, and therefore central to America's security,\" Sullivan said.\n\nAs far as any prospect for peace coming out of these global events, Munson still believes things are a long way off.\n\n\"I think it's unlikely it will lead to a breakthrough, but it could set the predicate for further conversations in a few months once we see if anybody is making headway on the ground,\" Munson said.", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_st_george@10news.com", "name": "Joe St. George", "type":

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be hoping G7 leaders allocate billions of dollars of frozen Russian assets to be redirected to the embattled Eastern European nation.\n\n\"Today is the G7 Summit in Italy, a meeting of our closest partners. Much of it will be dedicated to Ukraine, our defense, and economic resilience.

Instead, $50 billion will be bequeathed each year using loans, whilst the $3 billion in interest generated by the initial pot will be used to pay off the interest on said loans every year.\n\nJapanese outlet Nikkei reported that officials will address concerns over China's overproduction, as the East Asian country heavily subsidizes many of it's industries, particularly electric vehicle (EV) production.\n\nMany of the leaders attending the summit face uncertainty at home.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is widely expected to take a hammering next month in the country's General Election, after being in power for 14 years.\n\nJustin Trudeau could also be in trouble. He is up for re-election next year, with polls suggesting the Canadian Prime Minister's Liberal Party faces defeat.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz suffered losses in this weekend's European Parliament vote, and French President Emmanuel Macron recently called a snap election after his party endured a major setback in the same election.\n\nPresident Biden also has a significant battle ahead of him, as he and his rival, former President Donald Trump look set to have a tight race for The White House.\n\nPerhaps the only leader sitting comfortably would be Giorgia Meloni. Her right-wing Brothers of Italy party saw success over the weekend, remaining Italy's most popular party.\n\nThis is a fact Meloni is well aware of herself, she reportedly said to supporters after the vote: \"I am proud that this nation presents itself at the G7, and in Europe, as the strongest government of all.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"},

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe news comes on the first day of the G7 leaders' summit taking place in Apulia, Italy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe three-day summit is an opportunity for collaboration among the leaders of the wealthy democracies -- France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Japan.\n\nCanada has been heavily involved in the U.S.-led push to use the frozen assets to help Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 announced it was freezing Russian central bank assets in 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, Trudeau commended the G7 for the announcement.\n\n\"Canada's actually the first country to announce $5 billion of that will be a Canadian contribution,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy thanked Trudeau \"for your loud voice\" in support of Ukraine.\n\nA government source not authorized to discuss matters publicly said Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland was making calls last month to her G7 counterparts to drum up support for an agreement to use the assets to deliver more financial help to Ukraine.\n\nAs leaders announced the increased support on Thursday, Canada joined the U.S. and the U.K. in delivering a stark warning over Russian interference in Moldova, which neighbours Ukraine.\n\nThe three countries said in a statement that Russian actors are \"carrying out a plot to influence outcomes\" of the country's upcoming presidential election this fall.\n\n\"They intend to incite protests in Moldova should a pro-Russia candidate not win,\" the statement said.\n\n\"They seek to foment negative public perceptions of Western governments, Moldova's incumbent leadership and Moldova's potential for EU integration, while degrading public confidence in Moldova's ability to secure itself and maintain rule of law\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe statement said the three countries have full confidence in Moldova's ability to manage the threats, and they are taking measures to support the efforts.\n\n\"By revealing the Kremlin's plot, we are making it clear to Moscow that we stand for free and fair elections and will not tolerate its attempts to meddle and undermine democratic processes,\" it said.\n\nCanada has also announced sanctions against 11 people and 16 entities connected to Russia's \"military-industrial complex,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a news release. That includes entities involved in circumventing sanctions on Russian oil.\n\nTrudeau held meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on the first day of the summit.\n\nHe is also set to participate in working sessions with other leaders on collaboration with Africa, climate change, the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES

Here are some of the things that emerged from the opening sessions.\n\nSUPPORT FOR UKRAINE\n\n* The G7 leaders agreed in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine backed by interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\n\n* The technical details of the multi-year loan will be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters on Thursday, adding the funds for Ukraine would be available by the end of this year.\n\n* For a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attended the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday afternoon, after which he will sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\n* British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would announce up to $310 million in bilateral assistance to Ukraine to support its immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs.\n\n* Britain also imposed its first sanctions targeting vessels in Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"shadow fleet\" that it said was being used to circumvent Western sanctions and continue trade in Russian oil.\n\nDEALING WITH CHINA\n\n* Western nations are unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\n* White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that G7 leaders were more unified than ever on major issues, including Chinese industrial overcapacity.\n\n* The leaders are also expected to express their concern over China's support for Russia in its war with Ukraine.\n\nGLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n* A White House senior adviser for energy and investment said the G7 leaders would review progress on infrastructure at a side event which will include the heads of U.S. corporate heavyweights Microsoft and BlackRock.\n\n* The White House's Amos Hochstein said three major funds would commit $4 billion for investment in global infrastructure, and Biden would call on the G7 to continue to ramp up funding in developing countries.\n\n* Hochstein said Italy would join an African railway corridor project with an investment of $320 million.\n\nMIDDLE EAST\n\n* G7 leaders are very concerned by the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorse U.S. efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a draft communique due to be released following this week's summit.\n\n* Leaders also reiterated a commitment to a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, side-by-side and called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in Rafah.\n\n* A senior U.S. official said specific security arrangements were needed for the Israel-Lebanon border and a ceasefire in Gaza was not enough to secure peace in the region.

SULLIVAN: We've got a busy day ahead of us here at the first day of the G7. I'll just highlight a few items for you.\n\nThe first session will be on Africa, climate change, and development. And the President will have his chance, coming out of the Kenya state visit in particular, to talk about the full range of investments and approaches the U.S. has taken with respect to Africa to spur social and economic development, security, and in particular, investment. And I'll come on to that in a minute.\n\nWe believe the G7 will -- the statement will reflect the Nairobi-Washington Vision that President Biden signed with President Ruto on debt relief for low- and middle-income countries. And that's going to be an important outcome today.\n\nSecond, we'll have a session on the Middle East. This will be an opportunity for the leaders to get an update from President Biden on the negotiations with respect to the ceasefire and hostage deal, to talk about G7 support for bringing that deal to closure so that we can get a ceasefire in place and the hostages home.\n\nThey'll also talk about Lebanon and the increasing tension along that border, including the increasing intensity, scope -- intensity and scope of the strikes by Hezbollah deeper into Israel and including into civilian areas. President Biden will talk about the links between getting a ceasefire in Gaza and getting calm on the border between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nAnd of course, they'll compare notes on the continuing threat posed by Iran, both with respect to its support for proxy forces and with respect to the Iranian nuclear program, where we continue to have grave concerns and where the IAEA spoke last week.\n\nNext, the President will participate in a session with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and the G7 leaders on G7 support for Ukraine across the board. And that will be an opportunity to talk about coordination on sanctions, which the United States announced yesterday and other G7 partners will be announcing over the coming days. Of course, to talk about many of your favorite subject and mine: the mobilization of the proceeds from Russian sovereign assets to help Ukraine with respect to its resilience and economic needs.\n\nAs I told some of you guys on the plane yesterday, there's been very good progress in the discussions among the G7 delegations here to reach an agreement for how to make that happen. And hopefully by the time the leaders meet today, we will have a common vision for the way forward, and the Italian presidency will be able to announce that there is a path forward. But we'll all just have to wait and see what happens here in a few hours' time.\n\nThis has been something that the United States has put a lot of energy and effort into because we see the proceeds from these assets as being a valuable source of resources for Ukraine at a moment when Russia continues to brutalize the country, not just through military action on the front, but through the attempted destruction of its energy grid and its economic vitality.\n\nOne more thing I'll just note today coming in is we believe that, entering our fourth G7 -- President Biden's fourth G7, G7 leaders are more unified, really, than they've ever been, at least in modern memory, on the major issues across the board, whether that's geopolitical crises or its challenges related to the global economy, including issues like Chinese overcapacity.\n\nAnd as we've come into this G7, the European Union has taken what we believe is an important step with respect to the imposition of tariffs on electric vehicles from China. We welcome that action, which they implemented after a thorough investigation, to address China's unfair trade practices and the electric vehicle sector. And as we head into our first sessions here in Italy, we think this kind of alignment is what we're looking to build upon to create a level playing field for our workers and our firms.\n\nAnd then, the last thing I wanted to talk about is: Later today, the President will participate in and help lead a side event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, PGI. He'll co-host it with the Prime Minister of Italy. It will bring together leaders of the G7 and private sector executives, including the CEO and chairman of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, and the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, to identify incentives and methods to mobilize infrastructure investment with a particular focus on leveraging private capital.\n\nAnd so, the President will showcase how we're scaling the G7's flagship infrastructure initiative to attract major investors so that we can not just generate -- because the demand is there -- but channel the demand for high-quality infrastructure financing and make a connection between sources of private capital and the needs across the developing world.\n\nSo at this event, the President is going to announce that since the launch of PGI in 2022, we've initiated investments that will mobilize over $60 billion in support of PGI. And we're going to, in the next few months and years, accelerate investments so that we will hit the President's $200 billion mobilization goal by 2027.\n\nAnd he'll also highlight game-changing investments that we've unlocked in partnership with multilateral institutions in the private sector over the past year that advance our own supply chains and national security and our work to outcompete China. There'll be some more specific announcements that come out of that session later today.\n\nAnd then, just to close out the day, of course, as I mentioned yesterday, the President will be signing a bilateral security agreement with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. We think this is a big deal, a milestone moment in the partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine and a real marker of our commitment not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead, as we will continue to support Ukraine both in defending against Russian aggression and in deterring future aggression so that Ukraine can be a sovereign, viable, thriving democracy rooted and anchored in its partnership with the West and in the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\nSo, sorry to go on for so long, but that's where we are this morning, and I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nQ Jake, according to European Union sources, every reference to abortion and reproductive rights have been cancelled from the final declaration at the request of the Italian presidency. This is, of course, also a matter of international rights. Does the President know? Does he agree with that? Is he going to raise the issue of reproductive rights and general rights, LGBTQ rights, during the bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Meloni?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: The President always talks about human rights in all of his interactions, both with friends and with competitors and adversaries. And I don't expect the next two days will be any different.\n\nI can't speak to the specific assertion. I have not heard that with respect to discussions over the communiqu\u00e9 itself.\n\nBut from the President's point of view, he doesn't change up his message based on who he's talking to, and nothing about that will change today.\n\nQ On a ceasefire, Jake, can you update us based on what's the latest? I understand you spoke yesterday and there's really not much that you can say. But for people who are confused about the state of play at this point, would it be fair to characterize that Hamas has not agreed in private but say publicly that they have agreed, and Israel is the opposite of that in private, agreeing, but in public not agreeing?\n\nAnd then, if you could, just update my question yesterday, which was the U.N. inquiry that has called out both Hamas and Israel for violating international law and committing war crimes. If you've had a chance to look at that.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Look, we've made our position clear on the second issue in the report that emerged from National Security Memorandum 20. That's the U.S. position with respect to these questions of international humanitarian law. And I'll let that speak for itself. The U.N. is going to speak for itself through multiple voices and multiple channels. And I'm not going to give it further comment today.\n\nI don't entirely agree with your characterization. Israel has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back. To this day, they stand behind the proposal that was put on the table in late May that President Biden described in his May 31st speech. So I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position.\n\nI do think Hamas's assertion that they've accepted that proposal, to the extent that they are saying that publicly, is not correct. What they have done is responded to that proposal with an amended proposal. And as I said yesterday, some of those amendments are modest or minor. They're not unanticipated. We can work through them. Others are not consistent with what President Biden laid out or what the U.N. Security Council embraced.\n\nBut our goal is to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal. So we're going to work with Qatar and Egypt. Qatar and Egypt will work with Hamas. Qatar, Egypt, and the United States will work with Israel. And the goal is to try to bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible.\n\nNow, I can't give you a timetable for that. I would have to say that in complex negotiations like this, especially indirect negotiations, things don't happen necessarily instantly. And so, I may not have an update for you 12 hours from now any more than I do from 12 hours ago, but I can tell you that we are working actively to generate a path forward based on what Hamas has come in with that gets us to a result that's consistent with what the U.N. Security Council laid out and consistent with what President Biden laid out. We believe that is possible.\n\nWe still believe that it is important for the world to continue to train the focus on Hamas, who has said on behalf of the Palestinian -- on behalf of, you know, its leadership and, you know, its view of what is happening in Gaza, that it wants to get to a ceasefire. If, in fact, it does, there's a ceasefire on the table. They should take it and not try to push this thing in a direction where we just get to stalemate.\n\nAnd so, I think continuing to encourage Hamas to step up and do its part will be an important thing for the rest of the world.\n\nQ Just to put a finer point on that, Jake. So the Israelis have not agreed, at least publicly, to commit to a permanent peace path, the first phase, because that's essentially, you know, what Hamas is saying that they need in writing, or at least that's what we're hearing. Has the Israeli -- I mean, can you confirm that Israel will commit to a permanent ceasefire, despite the fact that we haven't heard it from them publicly?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: What I can confirm is that the Israelis have agreed to the proposal that the President laid out in detail, step by step. If you go back and read his May 31st text, everything in that is completely faithful to a document that Israel itself put forward and has not walked away from.\n\nQ Despite everything that they say publicly?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I don't think it's despite everything they say publicly. I think if you look at the document as laid out -- or, excuse me, the President's speech as laid out, that is something the Israelis have committed to, remain committed to. And I haven't heard any Israeli leader right now contradict that they stand behind the proposal put forward in late May.\n\nQ Jake, can you say a little bit more about the Washington-Nairobi Vision and what that means specifically? As I understand it, there's a lot of concern about China's slow progress in agreeing to debt restructuring. So will there be language that specifically calls out China, or will it be more broad? And, you know, what changes as a result of what you're expecting to happen?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, first, there are elements of the Nairobi-Washington declaration, or Washington-Nairobi declaration, that are really about increasing the capacity of countries bearing significant debt burdens to be able to pay those off, getting them access to lower-cost financing so that they're not just stuck with the high-cost financing that is like an albatross around their neck. And we've taken a number of steps through the multilateral development banks, the international financial institutions to make that available.\n\nSecond, it's about coordination and effectively getting the major private and public creditors together around a common vision.\n\nAnd that leads to this third point that you're raising, which is China is a significant creditor to a lot of countries who are saddled by debt burdens.\n\nThe G7 communiqu\u00e9 is not singling out or focusing on a single country. It's talking about a common approach every country, including China, should sign up to. But in the discussion the leaders have, they will all very much squarely face the reality that so much of the crushing debt burden facing countries around the world comes from China, and China needs to be a constructive actor in that.\n\nAnd I think you'll hear a common voice from the G7 about what the right path forward is. We'll be aligned on that. And that, I think, will set these developing countries up to have a more constructive conversation with China than they've been able to have to date.\n\nQ Can you talk a little bit about the migration aspect of the G7? I wondered -- a lot of the nations who are here are grappling with migration challenges, in particular the U.S. And I wonder what is -- you guys hope to glean from those discussions.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, as you know -- it's kind of amazing to say this -- but two years ago, more than two years ago, the President hosted the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles. And as part of that, he pulled more than 20 countries together around the Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection. And that basic vision for how to do effective, humane, and orderly migration management has remained at the core of his approach. And it has three elements to it.\n\nThe first is humane and effective enforcement. The second is investing in root causes so that people do not feel compelled to leave in the first place. And the third is expanding legal pathways so that we can have regular migration that can replenish the vitality of our nation and other nations across the hemisphere.\n\nSo to put a fine point on it, the goal of the President here at the G7 on migration is to take the Los Angeles Declaration and make it more than a regional compact but something that becomes a global vision. And we believe that the outcome of the G7 will reflect those core pillars of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. And it will build upon the actions that the President has taken, including the recent actions on border enforcement, as well as the steps he's taken to open up more legal pathways and to invest in root causes, not just in the Americas but in other parts of the world.\n\nAnd other G7 members are particularly focused on root cause investments in Africa and what I've just laid out with respect to PGI and the first session that will unfold today on Africa, climate, and development. That's all consistent with that pillar of the LA Declaration and that element of what the G7 approach will be when it's adopted today.\n\nQ As part of the discussion the President had over migration, he talked with, I think it's Spain and Canada -- right? -- to discuss, like, moving migrants over in Europe?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yeah, as part of lawful pathways.\n\nQ Yeah. Is there any discussion to broaden that to other G7 nations?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: It's not going to be a formal agenda item today, but it is a subject of some discussion with other countries as well, who are looking for regular, lawful migration for their economies, for their economic growth.\n\nAnd so, the President has always made clear that if other countries want to be partners with us in that regard, as Spain and Canada, then he would welcome that. And those discussions are ongoing.\n\nQ Hey, Jake. The President has often talked about, coming out of the first G7 in England, the conversations he had with Scholz and other then-world leaders about America being back, America's commitment to the world stage. Obviously, this could be his last G7.\n\nAnd I'm wondering if you can read us into how he's thinking about having some of those conversations, how your counterparts have talked with you about the possibility that there's a different American president next year (inaudible), and how you may put in place things to try to bridge any gaps between American administrations. I mean, just sort of how that might be hanging over some of the conversations, especially on the heels of the European elections, where a number of -- Macron, Scholz, their parties suffered some serious defeats.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Look, one of the great things about the G7 is we're all democracies, so the leaders here don't get to pick and choose how things go in their countries politically day in, day out. They leave that to the people of their countries.\n\nBut at the same time, I think the President, like the other G7 leaders who have just come off elections, they're going to be focused on the task at hand. And from his perspective, the real work to be done here is work that is going to put the United States in the best possible position to protect our interests and reflect our values.\n\nSo whether it's Russian sovereign assets or it's alignment about Chinese overcapacity, support for Ukraine, coordination on the ongoing crisis in Gaza, he's going to set kind of the broader election context aside and really focus in on the work that needs to get done here. And he's going to measure a successful G7 by whether or not we've made tangible progress on those issues. I think we're teed up for success in that regard, but we'll have to see how the next two days unfold.\n\nAnd then, you know, he's in -- every day subsequent to this summit, his goal is going to be to do as much as possible to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if we are closely aligned with our democratic allies and partners; that we are more likely to accomplish our objectives, more likely to protect the interests of our workers and businesses, more likely to produce security and stability when we are aligned, as opposed to in conflict, with the leading democracies of the world. That's going to be on display today.\n\nAnd the difference between past times when the U.S. has not been aligned and what you're going to see here in Puglia is something that can actually be measured, from my perspective, in an improved American standing in the world and the improved capacity of the United States to deliver for its people.\n\nQ Very quickly, on the state of the talks for unlocking the assets, (inaudible) to get this done or individual countries getting loans? Is the U.S. giving more loans? How does that stand?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, as a fellow member of the Air Force One plane team flying over here -- (laughter) -- I must have repeated like six time --\n\nQ Are you (inaudible) again?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- that I wouldn't get ahead of -- look, the Italian presidency, I think, has done a really good job of bringing everyone together around the table to try to deal with what's, you know, both a simple and a complex proposition. The simple proposition is we got to put these assets to work. The complex proposition is how you do that specifically.\n\nAnd so, I think we are on the verge of a good outcome here. I will wait until we have the session on Ukraine and let the Italians describe where we are.\n\nAs I said on the plane yesterday, I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable. That's how I anticipate this will all play out, to include how things will unfold on the vehicle and the range of countries that may step up on issues related to the loan.", "source": {"uri":

June 13 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday announced 5 billion Canadian dollars (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) in funding as the country's contribution to G7 Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans, an initiative of using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.\n\nAt the G7 (Group of Seven) summit in Apulia, Italy, the G7 reached consensus to launch G7 ERA Loans for Ukraine in order to make approximately 69 billion Canadian dollars (50 billion U.S. dollars) in additional funding available to Ukraine by the end of the year, Trudeau said in a press release.\n\n\"Canada has long advocated for new and innovative ways to support Ukraine,\" said Trudeau. \"Through this initiative, G7 countries would intend to bring forward the future revenues from frozen Russian sovereign assets.\"\n\nAccording to the release, the G7 intends to provide financing that will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian sovereign assets held in the European Union and other jurisdictions.\n\nTrudeau first proposed freezing the assets of Russia's central bank at the G7 leaders' meeting on Feb. 24, 2022, and in Budget 2022, Canada introduced the world's first legislation to allow the seizure and forfeiture of sanctioned Russian assets.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the Canadian police has frozen 140 million Canadian dollars (102 million U.S. dollars) in Russian assets in Canada since February 2022, and Global Affairs Canada said it ordered the seizure of a Russian plane and a company believed to be tied to a Russian oligarch. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Macron is followed by U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak with 25%. As for U.S. President Joe Biden, his approval ratings recently hit an all-time low of 37%.\n\nThroughout the duration of the summit, which is expected to last until Jun. 15, Trudeau will be flanked by his more popular and often adversarial colleagues. Italian Prime Minister and G7 host Giorgia Meloni enjoys a modest 42% approval rating, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a 70% approval rating at home.\n\nThe summit kicked off on Thursday with the announcement of a $5 billion deal to seize Russian assets abroad for the Ukrainian war effort. It was Canada's idea to appropriate Russian property in the first place, with Prime Minister Trudeau pitching the idea to his colleagues in February.\n\nYet things won't likely be smooth sailing for Trudeau, who has to navigate tense relations with India over the arrests of four Indian nationals believed to be involved in the assassination of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil.\n\nModi's government has denied any involvement in the killings, leading to a tense diplomatic row between the two administrations.\n\nThere's also Trudeau's habit of using the global summit to dig at Meloni and other Conservative politicians. During last year's iteration of the G7 meeting in Japan, Trudeau took the opportunity to lecture the Italian prime minister on her country's LGBTQ record.\n\nDifferences between the two leaders could rear their head again as Meloni pushes to remove mention of \"safe and legal abortion\" from the final statement to be put out by the Group of Seven at the summit's completion.\n\nWith the meeting being hosted by Italy, G7 leaders can also expect the participation of Pope Francis who is expected to attend bilateral meetings with heads of state on Friday, including with Trudeau.", "source":

All but Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni face tough elections, domestic crisis, or political peril - in some cases all of the above.\n\nThe G7 meeting comes less than a week after far-right parties dominated in European Parliamentary elections, indicating next year's gathering could face an entire new crop of leaders standing with Meloni.\n\nThat doesn't bode well for their agenda over the next two days, which includes the war in the Ukraine, the battle in the Middle East and China's push for global dominance. Some leaders will be reluctant to make commitments when they face angry voters back home.\n\n'With the exception of Meloni, the leaders at the G7 summit are all pretty weak,' Ivo Daalder, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO under former President Barack Obama, told Politico.\n\n'Trudeau is probably not going to win the next election. Biden has a tough election race. Scholz is weakened. Macron is weakened. Sunak is a 'dead man walking,' and Kishida has serious issues at home as well.'\n\nIn fact, although the G7 is scheduled to go through Saturday, most of the leaders, including Biden, are leaving Friday night.\n\nFrom left : President of the European Council Charles Michel, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen pose for a family photo at the G7\n\nHere's a look at where things stand back at home for the G7 leaders:\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\n\nNervous world leaders are watching the upcoming American election carefully and wondering if it will be Joe Biden or Biden Trump who will join them at next year's G7 meeting in Canada.\n\nTrump is leading in the key battleground states that will decide the next inhabitant of the White House. The former president has been a critic of world alliances like NATO and the G7. And world leaders don't see him as a reliable ally on the Ukraine, the Middle East, or, well, anything.\n\nThe 81-year-old Biden faces his first presidential debate with Trump less than two weeks after he returns from Italy. And he arrived at the G7 the day after his son Hunter Biden was convicted of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun.\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, in a briefing with reporters on Thursday, downplayed political concerns.\n\n'The great thing about the G7 is we're all democracies, so the leaders here don't get to pick and choose how things go in their countries politically, day in day out, they leave that to the people of their countries,' he said.\n\n'But at the same time, I think the President like the other G7 leaders who have just come off elections to get them focused on the task at hand.'\n\nSullivan added that Biden is 'going to set kind of the broader election context aside and really focus on the work that needs to get done here and he's going to measure a successful G7 by whether or not we made tangible progress on those issues.'\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\n\nBritish PM Rishi Sunak is battling a snap election campaign he called in an attempt to reverse his sagging political fortune.\n\nBut he's made a series of major public relation mistakes - including leaving last week's D-Day ceremony early to conduct at TV interview - that have caused him to sink lower and lower.\n\nPolls indicate the July 4 election will result in a center-left landslide for opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer.\n\nSunak's conservative party has been struggling in the UK as it dealt with fallout from Brexit.\n\nThe prime minister had to call the election before the end of this year and there seemed to be no good time to do it but every campaign move he's tried seemed to backfire, leading most pundits to predict a massive loss for him.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\n\nJustin Trudeau, who has been prime minister for nine years in Canada, is in danger of losing the upcoming election to his main challenger, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\n\nTrudeau, who faces low approval ratings back home, must call an election within the next year.\n\nHe is expected to go for a fourth term but his polling is worse than Biden's - he has trailed rivals by double digits for nearly a year.\n\nHe has lamented the rising political tide on the right.\n\n'We have seen around the world a rise of populist right-wing forces in just about every democracy,' Trudeau said on Monday. 'It is of concern to see political parties choosing to instrumentalize anger, fear, division, anxiety.'\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called for snap elections after his rival Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) crushed his party in the European elections.\n\nLe Pen's party won twice the number of Parliament seats as Macron's. She, like Trump, pushes nationalist, anti-immigration as her agenda.\n\nMany French voters used the EU election to express dissatisfaction with Macron\u00b4s management of the economy, farming rules, or security.\n\nMacron dissolved the French National Assembly and the election will be held in two rounds: June 30 and July 7.\n\nHe said his decision was a last-ditch attempt to keep the far right out of power.\n\n'Everybody sees the flood waters of the far right rising. Everybody is saying [Macron] will hand them the keys of power. I don't want to give them the keys to power in 2027,' he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, like Macron, was slammed by far-right nationalists in last weekend's European Parliament election.\n\nThere are concerns he could soon be toppled himself.\n\nHe has presided over the most unpopular government in modern German history.\n\nProjections showed support for Scholz\u00b4s center-left Social Democrats at 14%, their worst post-World War II result in a nationwide vote.\n\nHis party came in third and, while he has not called for new elections, he is under political pressure to do so.\n\nAlso of concern, the far-right Alternative for Germany made good gains despite a string of scandals surrounding its top two candidates for the EU legislature.\n\nThat's especially sobering to many, given Germany's Nazi past.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida faces his lowest personal approval ratings ahead of a leadership contest later this year.\n\nHe has faced calls to step down after a political funds scandal damaged his Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nBut he has refused, thus far, to do so.\n\nHurting him is the fact that members of his own party, in down-ballot contests, are losing. And, in April, his party lost all three seats in parliament.\n\nHis Cabinet faces record-low approval ratings.\n\nHe had reportedly considering calling a snap election, with a win by the ruling bloc buoying him ahead of September's ruling party leadership race. The head of the ruling party concurrently serves as prime minister.\n\nBut he has not yet called for elections and it's unclear when he will do so.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is the most politically secure of all the leaders she is hosting.\n\nHer party did well in last week's election, even improving its performance from the 26% it won in the 2022 general elections.\n\nShe is positioning herself as one of the most powerful leaders in the European Union, but Italy is not considered a world superpower, which calls into question the limits of her influence.\n\nA massive fan of 'The Lord of the Rings' and other works by the British writer J.R.R. Tolkien, Meloni used to dress as a hobbit.\n\n'I think that Tolkien could say better than us what conservatives believe in,' Melon, said shortly after her election.\n\nShe sees the books as sacred text.\n\n'I don't consider 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy,' she said.\n\nHer party did well in last week's European election, further cementing her power.\n\nShe has expanded this year's G7 meeting, inviting leaders of several other countries, including Ukraine, Turkey, India, Argentina, Brazil, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a first-time participant at a G7 summit.\n\nPope Francis, who will lead the discussion on AI, is guest of honour.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Most of the assets are being held in Belgium.\n\nUnder international law, countries cannot confiscate those assets from Russia and give them to Ukraine.\n\nBut the pot is generating a lot of interest - about $3bn a year - so the idea is to use that interest in a creative way.\n\nThe plan is to take out a loan on the international markets, give about $50bn to the Ukrainians each year, and use the $3bn to pay off the interest on that loan each year.\n\nBut there are still lots of technicalities to sort out.\n\nPresident Biden's security adviser Jake Sullivan says the \"major tentpoles\" of the plan have been decided and that a good outcome is likely.\n\nIn recent weeks Russian officials have spoken about the idea of taking the interest from seized assets as \"theft\", threatening to retaliate.\n\nWith Mr Biden in the middle of a close election contest, and several other Western leaders lagging in the polls, there is pressure to deliver support to Ukraine while they still can.\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who faces an upward struggle ahead of next month's general elections, is set to announce up to $309m in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs.\n\nAlso facing voters soon is the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, who called a snap parliamentary election after a resounding loss to the far-right National Rally in last weekend's elections to the EU's parliament.\n\nItaly's Giorgia Meloni has boasted that her country was heading into this summit with \"the strongest government of all\", after a strong performance in the European elections last weekend.\n\nClick on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:

Common challenges require common solutions and, together with its international partners, Canada is working to build a better, more equitable future where security, stability and prosperity reign.\n\nAt the G7 Summit, Prime Minister Trudeau participated in working sessions aimed at improving security and stability in the world, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East. During his meetings with G7 partners, the Prime Minister stressed the importance of the whole world supporting Ukraine in defending its freedom.\n\nThe Prime Minister announced significant measures, including $5 billion in funding, to support Ukraine's fight for freedom.\n\nThese measures include the following:\n\nCanada's contribution to G7 loans for accelerating the use of extraordinary revenues for the benefit of Ukraine. Canada has long advocated using new and innovative ways to support Ukraine and impose costs on Russia for its illegal and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine. As the G7 finalizes the delivery of extraordinary revenue-funded loans, Canada stands ready to provide $5 billion in financing. As part of this initiative, G7 countries would intend to anticipate possible revenues from frozen Russian sovereign assets. Ukraine would therefore receive approximately $69 billion (US$50 billion) to continue its fight to defend its freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity. A new set of sanctions targeting the Russian military-industrial complex. Canada imposes sanctions on 11 individuals and 16 entities that provide important electrical technologies and components in support of Russia's war of aggression, entities involved in sanctions evasion that help Russia to access sanctioned goods or oil revenues sold at a price above the ceiling set by the G7, as well as to individuals and entities involved in disinformation and propaganda operations. The sending to Europe of the first four armored tactical support vehicles, among the fifty that will be built in Canada, to support the armed forces of Ukraine. The Prime Minister noted that the dispatch of these first armored medical evacuation vehicles further strengthens Canada's practical support to Ukraine, in line with the $650 million package announced by Canada last September .\n\nIn Puglia, G7 leaders reaffirmed their support for the comprehensive agreement proposed by President Biden, which would result in an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of remaining hostages, a significant and sustained increase humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza and a lasting end to the crisis, ensuring Israel's security interests and the safety of civilians in Gaza. The leaders reaffirmed their support for a two-state solution and stressed the need to continue working with governments in the region to avoid the conflict spilling over into neighboring territories, which could further undermine stability and security in the region. Prime Minister Trudeau reiterated his deep concern about the impact of the conflict on the lives of civilians, including remaining hostages, and highlighted the $165 million spent so far in aid funding to support the provision food, water, emergency medical aid, protective services and other forms of life-saving assistance to civilians.\n\nIn addition to helping build a secure and stable world, Canada is also taking the lead in fostering the growth of global economies centered on the well-being of all citizens and future generations.\n\nAs part of the Summit, the Prime Minister participated in a G7 working session on Africa, climate change and development as well as a parallel activity on the G7 Global Infrastructure and Investment Partnership, during which he highlighted a series of measures totaling more than $1.6 billion aimed at promoting inclusive and dynamic growth anchored in the global transition to clean energy.\n\nThese measures include:\n\n$720 million in funding over five years to support a new concessional financing mechanism managed by FinDev Canada. This mechanism will expand the range of investments to mobilize additional capital in support of sustainable development, including from the private sector. Following the $750 million in additional capital announced by the federal government in 2022 to support the institution's global mandate and add the Indo-Pacific region to the program, the funding announced today will further strengthen the box Canada's development tools. It also includes $20 million to provide technical assistance to provide greater support to FinDev Canada's clients so they can fill the knowledge gap and promote sustainable investing. the purchase of $274 million (US$200 million) of hybrid equity issued by the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This will enable Canada to provide additional loans of up to $1.8 billion to developing countries so that they can advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including improving education and health and the reduction of food insecurity and the carbon footprint. providing $510 million in repayable contributions and technical assistance grants to the Inter-American Development Bank Group to establish the Net Zero Acceleration and Climate Resilience Fund. This contribution will encourage the private sector to invest in projects that will help Latin American and Caribbean economies reduce their carbon intensity, better resist the effects of climate change and become more inclusive. agreeing a $120 million sovereign loan and $6.5 million technical assistance grant to South Africa under the Just Energy Transition Partnership. In line with the sovereign loan agreement signed last March, Canada supports South Africa-led efforts to transition to clean, secure and affordable energy, while closing gaps in economic inclusion. the granting of a repayable loan of $45 million to the Private Infrastructure Development Group. This measure, which aims to mobilize private sector investment, will increase financing opportunities for sustainable infrastructure that better promotes gender equality in Africa and Asia.\n\n\"We are working with our G7 partners to address the most pressing challenges of our time and build a world of stability and security. Today, at the G7 Summit, we announced support for Ukraine in its defense of freedom, steps to hold Russia accountable for its war of aggression, and joint efforts to foster the growth of inclusive, equitable and dynamic global economies. \"\n\nToday, in Puglia, Prime Minister Trudeau held bilateral meetings with the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz.

In Budget 2022, Canada introduced the world's first legislation enabling the seizure and confiscation of Russian assets subject to sanctions. During the G7 leaders' conference call held on February 24, 2024, Prime Minister Trudeau, who was on an official visit to Ukraine, was the first to address the subject of the Russian Central Bank's assets, and proposed seizing the assets now frozen. In Budget 2024, Canada presented a detailed proposal to work with G7 allies to fully utilize Russian assets currently tied up in their respective territories, including possible expansion of the windfall utilization mechanism, in the aim of anticipating payments for the coming years to Ukraine under this system.

The mechanism will contribute to the fight against climate change, gender equality and the development of local markets. The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) helps increase financing for sustainable infrastructure that better promotes gender equality in Africa and Asia.

Canada is committed to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at home and abroad. Over the past decade, Canada has been at the forefront of discussions on financing for development at the United Nations. Since 2016, Canada has co-chaired the UN Group of Friends on financing the SDGs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau co-chairs the UN SDG Advocates Group and the SDG Stimulus Leaders Group, which help drive collective action toward the SDGs, including efforts to improve access financing from emerging economies and developing countries. Canada's National Strategy for the 2030 Agenda aims to drive progress on the SDGs through collective action and engagement. The objective is to ensure that all partners contribute in their own way and in collaboration with others to achieving the SDGs.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

Meanwhile, Western countries have supplied battle tanks and fighter jets.\n\nKishida and Zelenskyy met on the sidelines of a three-day Group of Seven summit in Fasano in southern Italy through Saturday. It is the second consecutive year that Zelenskyy has been invited to attend the G7 summit in person as a guest.\n\nThe agreement between Japan and Ukraine would follow a joint declaration by the G7 leaders issued in July 2023, in which they promised to work with Ukraine \"on specific, bilateral, long-term security commitments\" and other supportive measures.\n\nSince Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Japan has condemned the aggression along with other G7 members and like-minded nations while boosting support for Kyiv and imposing strict economic sanctions on Moscow.\n\nIn February, Japan hosted a conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine in Tokyo, pledging 15.8 billion yen ($100 million) in grant aid to assist with the restoration of electricity and other energy infrastructure, among other recovery projects.\n\nAfterward, Japan and Ukraine signed 56 memorandums of cooperation in seven areas, including agriculture and digitalization. Kishida and Zelenskyy last held in-person bilateral talks in May 2023 on the fringes of the G7 summit in Hiroshima, western Japan.", "source": {"uri": "english.kyodonews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kyodo News+"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumio_Kishida", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fumio Kishida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/b2c52e95f3678adb2d4f568adf89f30b/photo_l.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644998", "eventUri": "eng-9644998", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

(AP)\n\nThere are two contrasting narratives about this year's G7 summit. On the one hand, the group has seen a return to prominence since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the G7 in many ways becoming the steering committee for the West in its efforts to counter what it believes are the biggest threats to the international order -- namely, Russia and China.\n\nOn the other hand, nearly all of the leaders attending this year's summit have been significantly weakened domestically since last year's gathering:\n\nIt is essentially unprecedented for both the French and German governments, historically seen as the engine of European integration, to be so feeble at the same time, which could mean a reconfiguration of power centers within the European Union. That's especially true following this past weekend's European Parliament elections, which resulted in the EU's balance of power shifting right. The biggest winner of that vote may well be far-right Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, whose strength at home and prominence in the EU has only risen over the past year.\n\nAnd of course, looming over all of this is the possibility of a second term for Trump, which would shake up the entire trans-Atlantic alliance and throw the West's response to Russia into uncertainty.\n\nTo be sure, the state of uncertainty and the weakness of the G7's leaders has not prevented the group from achieving some of its goals. Already today, the group has agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using interest earned from frozen Russian assets as collateral. But there is also a sense at this year's summit that these leaders are under pressure to get more done while the status quo lasts -- and before the G7 once again fades from prominence.\n\nThe G7's obituary has been written before, and the group has each time shown more resilience than its doubters expected. But looking back in a few years time, it would not be surprising if this year's summit marks the end of the G7's current moment of glory.\n\nNadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a Palestinian professor at a prominent Israeli university, was detained in April and is being investigated for incitement to terrorism after speaking out against the war in Gaza and calling Israel's assault on the territory a genocide.\n\nShalhoub-Kevorkian's story is not uncommon. Since the war in Gaza began, Israel's Arab citizens have faced censorship and retaliation for opposing the war, while Palestinian members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, have been sanctioned for expressing their objections to Israel's conduct in Gaza.\n\nHowever, one positive outcome of the past eight months has been the ability of Arab political parties and their leaders to skillfully manage the challenging situation in order to prevent tensions from escalating between Israel's Arab and Jewish citizens, as Anwar Mhajne wrote in May.\n\nIn Uganda, a man campaigning against the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, or EACOP, is recovering in the hospital after having allegedly been beaten by members of Uganda's armed forces. It's the latest incident in what appears to be a growing crackdown on opposition to the pipeline in the country.\n\nEACOP, a planned pipeline that would ferry petroleum nearly 900 miles to the Tanzanian coast, has been in the works for more than a decade. But it has faced growing opposition from both environmentalists and the farmers whose land is being acquired for the project. As Sophie Neiman reported last year, in response, many of those farmers have faced intimidation from authorities and the oil companies behind the pipeline.\n\nA fleet of Russian warships reached Cuban waters yesterday ahead of planned military exercises, which will also involve Venezuela. As James Bosworth wrote Monday, while the U.S. and the Caribbean region should remain calmly vigilant about any Russian antics during the drills, they should also be careful to avoid hyperbole.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron announced that he has suspended a controversial constitutional amendment process that would have altered voting rights in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia. The measure, and Macron's heavy-handed approach to it, was the catalyst for deadly riots on the island last month, but as we explained in a Daily Review at the time, the roots of the unrest go much further back.", "source": {"uri": "worldpoliticsreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Politics Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip",

But also leaders in crisis at the first high-level international summit right after the European elections, the host Giorgia Meloni tempted to visibly bring home the new political success at the european elections, the hot dossier on the management of assets frozen to Russia, concerning stances from China, and the final joint declaration in the hands of the sherpas.\n\nArticolo precedentemente pubblicato su The Watcher Post e qui consultabile.\n\nInaugural dinner and jazz music with Mattarella\n\nThe G7 at Borgo Egnazia in Puglia, under the Italian Presidency, kicks off a summer full of crucial diplomatic appointments for the fate of international crises. And it does so with style. Starting from the evocative and iconic Puglia region location, to tomorrow's inaugural dinner in three rooms of the noble floor of the Castello Svevo in Brindisi, the only event attended by the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella. The closed-door banquet will include a brief welcoming speech by the President of the Republic, followed by four courses of Puglia tradition: scorpion fish with sun-dried tomatoes and aromatic herbs with barattieri and Torre Guaceto fiaschetto tomatoes, tortelli stuffed with gurnard with julienne of smoked kingfish, dentex fillet with almonds from Toritto, and ending with a burrata cream with sweet tarallo crumble and ferrovia cherries. This will be followed by Carduus bitter and Fadi coffee. All catered by Pierangelo Argentieri, president of Federalberghi and director of Tenuta Moreno. Accompanying the dinner with Mattarella will be a mini jazz concert by saxophonist Stefano Di Battista, who will perform five pieces.\n\nMeloni sails forward, others in difficulty or term expiration\n\nStarting Friday, the program includes two days of dense discussion sessions. At the G7, the only European leader strengthened by the EU vote is Giorgia Meloni. The political moment is dark for Macron and Scholz, joined by the Japanese Kishida, who swims in the same waters. Carrying expiring mandates are leaders of the stature of Biden, Sunak, and Trudeau. And there are even those too busy saving the national government to attend the Italian G7 Summit: such is the case for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, grappling with negotiations to form a coalition government after a bitter electoral defeat. That the host and current G7 President Giorgia Meloni is the only leader with political wind in her sails is certainly a more than positive starting point for the summit. Her challenge will be to convince the present colleagues in difficulty or nearing term expiration not to hesitate, to dare. And for the G7 tradition, this is no easy challenge. 'Supported by the elections, Meloni enjoys the spotlight while Italy hosts the G7,' writes the New York Times. 'She has the chance to demonstrate her influence on an even larger stage.'\n\nThe Commitment of the Holy Father\n\n'At the G7 we will talk about artificial intelligence and also about peace. I will have bilateral meetings, there are requests from seven heads of state. I will meet them all.' So said Pope Francis, demonstrating the maximum commitment of the Holy Father to peace and the ethical issue of the moment: Artificial Intelligence. 'The Pope at the G7 will talk about ethical attention,' anticipated Father Paolo Benanti, advisor to Pope Francis on AI and ethics of technology. He added: 'The entire pontificate of Pope Francis is played out on these frontier issues. Think of how he started in Lampedusa with migrants, and how he continued with the encyclical 'Laudato Si' on the environment, and now on Artificial Intelligence. The Pope shows he has antennae that perceive where humanity is moving at this moment, and I think this will be one of the focuses of his speech at the G7, which will stimulate the greats of the Earth.'\n\nThe issue of the management of Russia's assets\n\n'We will discuss how Ukraine can more quickly benefit from the proceeds of immobilized Russian assets. Russia must be held accountable for its crimes. And now we are making Russia pay,' said Ursula Von der Leyen at the Berlin Conference for the Reconstruction of Ukraine. According to Biden and Macron, an agreement on the management of Russian assets is close, but in Europe, caution prevails and the knot is still to be untied. On the table are approximately 300 billion euros in value of Russian assets frozen in the West. Which alone generate interest of over 3.5 billion euros, theoretically not due to Russia. The USA is pushing for this money to act as a guarantee for a loan of up to 50 billion to be raised on the market (common bonds?), to be spent 90% on military aid and 10% on reconstruction. But Europeans have doubts in terms of legal and juridical coverage of the operation. And they fear that it could preclude future Russian investments in the Old Continent. The Bank of Italy governor, Fabio Panetta has already called for 'wisdom and prudence, because there may be repercussions on the functioning of the international monetary system.' While China on potential limits on Chinese financial institutions in transactions with Russia has warned: 'The normal economic and commercial cooperation between China and Russia will not be interrupted by any third party.'\n\nRumors on the contents of the final joint declaration\n\nThe condemnation of the increasingly close relations between Russia and North Korea. This is the first preview by Kyodo news agency on what the final joint declaration of the Puglian Summit will include. In particular, the 'military cooperation' between Moscow and Pyongyang will be mentioned. In the draft in the hands of the sherpas, as leaks reveal, also a firm commitment to support Ukraine and concerns over the growing military assertiveness of China. But the next 24/48 hours could make a difference. Hopefully for the better.", "source": {"uri": "geopolitica.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "Geopolitica.info"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgo_Egnazia",

Their countries are major trading partners, and even if their share of global trade has declined, they account for about half of the world economy. They also share broadly similar views on trade, security and human rights, giving them enormous influence when they act in concert.Every year, as the leaders of the major industrialized nations gather for a summit, the same questions arise: What exactly is the summit for, and why does the group matter?\n\nThe heads of the Group of 7 nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- started their annual summit Thursday at a luxury hotel in Puglia on the southern Italian coast, overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip and the threats posed by China's economic rise are high on the agenda.\n\nThe leaders, along with representatives of the European Union and selected guests, meet to discuss economic issues and major international policies. This year the summit's host, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, has also invited other figures including Pope Francis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.\n\nWhatever the leaders' disagreements on the issues, one feature of the summits tends to be a shared overall outlook. Their countries are major trading partners, and even if their share of global trade has declined, they account for about half of the world economy. They also share broadly similar views on trade, security and human rights, giving them enormous influence when they act in concert.\n\nA recent example of that is the war in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose defense against the Russian invasion of his country has been a rallying point for the G7, is attending again this year.\n\nBy the same token, President Vladimir Putin of Russia is one of the group's most notable absentees. Russia was a member of the group from 1997 until it was excluded in 2014, the year that its forces entered eastern Ukraine and seized Crimea.\n\nThe group's origins go back to the 1973 oil crisis. It grew out of an informal gathering of finance ministers from Britain, France, Japan, the United States and what was then West Germany -- initially known as the Big Five -- as they tried to agree on a way forward.\n\nSince then, the group and its added members have met dozens of times to work on major issues that affect the international economy, security, trade, equality and climate change. In 2015, the summit paved the way for the Paris Agreement to limit global carbon emissions, which was adopted later that year.\n\nThe summits are often defined by the most pressing issues of the day: The Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, the financial crisis of 2008 and the coronavirus pandemic that began in 2019 have all dominated the meetings.\n\nThey are also a showcase for cultural diplomacy, as each year's host country offers examples of the best of its cuisine.\n\nFor all the aura of diplomacy at the summit, however, each leader has an eye on domestic politics as well. A leader fresh from an election victory can sometimes arrive with a swagger. For a leader about to face an angry electorate, the reverse can be true. Several of the leaders in Italy this week are in the latter category.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news",

There are still lots of technicalities to sort out.President Biden's security adviser Jake Sullivan says the \"major tentpoles\" of the plan have been decided and that a good outcome is likely.In recent weeks Russian officials have spoken about the idea of taking the interest from seized assets as \"theft\".

( Image Source :X/@AmbasciataUSA )\n\nUS President Joe Biden faced criticism for an awkward salute to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni upon his arrival at the G7 Summit on Thursday. The incident, captured on camera, sparked a flurry of reactions on social media, with some questioning Biden's awareness and others defending his gestures. Biden, 81, arrived in Italy amidst ongoing scrutiny over his mental and physical acuity, heightened during his re-election campaign. The G7 Summit, gathering leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US, focuses on global security and economic issues.\n\nAs Biden approached the stage where Meloni awaited, he was the last foreign leader to arrive at the venue in southern Puglia. Following a brief exchange of words, Meloni directed Biden's attention to a frame bearing the G7 logo, which all leaders had signed.\n\nIn a moment captured by cameras, Biden raised his right hand towards his eye in a salute gesture towards Meloni before stepping away from the platform.\n\nMeloni, visibly unfazed by the incident, continued engaging with other international leaders throughout the summit, which also addressed pressing global issues including the Ukraine crisis.\n\nSocial media quickly amplified the moment, with videos of the salute circulating widely. While some criticised Biden's gesture as inappropriate or out of touch, others interpreted it as a sign of respect towards the Italian PM.\n\nA user joked, \"Did Girogia Meloni join the US Military and no one told us? Why did Biden just salute her?\" In response, one user defended Biden's gesture, suggesting it was informal and akin to a thumbs-up gesture.\n\nOthers, however, expressed more critical views, with one commenter noting, \"He doesn't know where he is\".", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Conferences", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 6}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/06/13/3e20831bda3b8b0e5f63a9eb5bf059fa1718288329123556_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644998", "eventUri": "eng-9644998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

[+] (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Business leaders should be ready to respond to people who publicly criticize or question their handling of a crisis. Otherwise, their allegations could make a bad situation worse\u2014and damage careers and reputations. Dr. Anthony Fauci has more experience dealing with criticism over the course of a decades-long career than most corporate executives. His recent appearance before a House committee is the latest example of how he has handled critics. Fauci was unequivocal in his response to the latest round of criticism. The former government scientist who is \u201cboth celebrated and despised for his work on Covid, on Monday forcefully denied Republican allegations that he had helped fund research that sparked the pandemic or had covered up the possibility it originated in a laboratory, calling the accusations \u2018absolutely false and simply preposterous,\u2019\u201d the New York Times reported. Criticism can lead to the resignation of executives who don\u2019t do or say enough in response to their critics. Harvard University president Claudine Gay resigned after weeks of calling for her to step down over her response to antisemitism on campus\u2014and her testimony on the topic at a fiery House hearing last December. In response to questions by a Republican committee member, Gay said that calling for genocide of Jews may or may not have violated university rules on bullying and harassment \u201cdepending on the context.\u201d Though Gay later apologized, these comments sparked sharp criticism from Congress, the Harvard community and the public, and fueled calls for her resignation.

Respond Quickly The sooner you respond to criticism, the better. Otherwise, unanswered allegations or aspersions could lead people to assume that the charges are true. Monitor social media and news organization for how they are covering your response to the crisis, and what critics are saying about your management of the situation. Set The Record Straight Cite facts, figures, and other relevant information that effectively counters the charges others make. Be Consistent Ensure that what you say and how you say it are consistent with the messaging and information that was originally shared about the crisis. Creating an element of doubt or giving new reasons for others to question your management of the crisis could deepen or extend it. Seek Allies Ask others who have the appropriate and relevant expertise to speak up on your behalf. Their voices could help bolster your credibility, put critics on the defensive, and help make the criticism a non-issue. Keep It Short Don\u2019t say anything more than necessary to refute the allegations. Brevity is critical, and can ensure that others\u2014including news organizations\u2014will quote or repeat your response. Admit Mistakes If criticism for how a crisis was managed is justified, immediately own up to the mistake and explain the steps that will be taken to ensure it is not repeated. Practice When testing crisis management plans, include scenarios in which the decisions, actions, and judgement of those who managed the crisis are publicly called into question. Be Proactive When a crisis strikes, consider how others will react to your management of the situation. Then prepare a list of the worst accusations that could be made for how the matter was handled\u2014and how your organization would respond to those charges. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

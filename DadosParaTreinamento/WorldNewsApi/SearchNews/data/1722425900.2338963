Vitale announced Friday that a biopsy of a lymph node in his network showed cancer. He is scheduled to have surgery Tuesday. \u201cWith all the (prayers) I have received & the loving support of my family, friends and ESPN colleagues, I will win this battle,\u201d Vitale said on on X, formerly Twitter. The 85-year-old Vitale has previously been treated for melanoma and lymphoma. He also had six weeks of radiation treatments last year when tests revealed he had vocal cord cancer. Vitale has been with ESPN since 1979, the year the network launched. The former coach called ESPN\u2019s first college basketball broadcast. He\u2019s also a longtime fundraiser for cancer research. Vitale helped friend Jim Valvano to the stage at the 1993 ESPYs, where Valvano delivered his famous \u201cDon\u2019t give up\u201d speech. Valvano died of adenocarcinoma less than two months later. ___ AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "summary": "Longtime ESPN college basketball analyst Dick Vitale said on social media he has been diagnosed with cancer for a fourth time", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-espn-bristol-twitter-b2570980.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/29/01/ESPN_Vitale_Basketball_76074.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:09:27", "author": "Via AP news wire", "authors": ["Via AP news wire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.259}

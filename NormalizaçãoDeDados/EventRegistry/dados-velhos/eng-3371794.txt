Mr McConnell may prefer to think he acted in self-defence. I believe his judgement was totally clouded by drugs and alcohol.'\n\nLove of their lives: After many attempts at creating a family for Caben, the duo remain at loggerheads to this day much to their respective chagrin\n\nDuring her testament in court on Monday, Stephanie described the assault 'like something out of a horror movie', adding that the Irish model threatened to smash a bottle over his head.\n\nThe prosecution said the assault took place as Stephanie held Caben in her arms, a claim that was denied by Jeremy.\n\nThe former Hollyoaks actress said: 'He's completely destroyed my life, it's been the worst 18 months of my life.'

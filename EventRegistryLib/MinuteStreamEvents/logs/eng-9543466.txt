However, after Saboor left WWE and joined Full Sail University, plans changed, leading to the current decision in favor of Las Vegas.\n\nDespite Minneapolis initially looking like the likely choice, WWE's change of ownership swayed the decision toward Las Vegas, given its association with UFC and the overall prestige of the market.

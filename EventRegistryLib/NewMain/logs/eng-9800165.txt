The rapid growth in cruise holidays and increase in cruise ship sizes comes at a significant environmental cost, says T&E.\n\nThe global cruise industry has boomed over the past half a century, with the number of ships rising twentyfold from only 21 in 1970 to 515 today. A combination of more and bigger cruise ships means that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were nearly 20% higher in 2022 than they were in 2019 before the pandemic.\n\nToday's cruisezillas make the Titanic look like a small fishing boat. How much bigger can these giants get? The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\n\n... said Inesa Ulichina, sustainable shipping officer at T&E\n\nIn the face of backlash, many cruise operators are switching to liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative to traditional shipping fuels like heavy fuel oil. LNG-powered ships make up 38% of global cruise ship orders today. While LNG emits less pollutants and CO2 when burned, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than CO2, T&E notes.\n\nInesa Ulichina, added: \"The only green and scalable solution for decarbonising maritime activities is e-fuels. Cruising is a luxury business and operators must take responsibility for their climate impact. If they want to avoid becoming increasingly unwanted visitors, they must clean up their act.\"\n\nGreen e-fuels could power almost 4% of European shipping in 2030, a recent T&E study shows. The limited availability of e-fuels and their bunkering infrastructure should be less of an issue for the cruise ships, says T&E, as they sail on the same routes with clear schedules, making their fuel refuelling needs and timings predictable and relatively easy to plan.\n\nIt can also be financially beneficial for cruise operators to switch to green fuels, the latest study shows. Due to the EU's carbon price on ships which took effect from the beginning of this year, and progressively increasing FuelEU Maritime penalties for using the dirtiest shipping fuels from 2025, sailing only on fossil fuel will become 13% more expensive than blending 4% of e-methanol into the fuel mix in 2030. The cost increase when sailing on fossil fuel compared to blending e-fuels could reach more than 30% in 2040 and over 80% in 2050.\n\nCruise ships are currently exempt from fuel duties, corporate taxes and most of the consumer taxes that other modes of transport are subject to. A \u20ac50 ticket tax on a typical cruise ticket would bring in \u20ac1.6 billion globally, according to the analysis. This could provide crucial climate finance and ensure that luxury forms of travel are taxed, says T&E.", "source": {"uri": "safety4sea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SAFETY4SEA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anastasia_kypriotaki@safety4sea.com", "name": "Anastasia Kypriotaki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross tonnage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruising_(maritime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruising (maritime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuel oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunkering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online_Grocery_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online Grocery Stores", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shutterstock_2325256347.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800165", "eventUri": "eng-9800165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

Across 20 decks, it features seven pools, a waterpark and more than 40 bars and restaurants spread across eight 'neighbourhoods'.\n\nBy 2050, if cruises keep growing at the rate of the past 20 years, T&E predicts that the largest ships could carry 10,500 passengers with a GT of 345,000.\n\nThe number of ships at sea has also increased exponentially in recent decades, growing by 20 times from 22 ships in 1970 to 521 today.\n\nBigger ships, and more of them, mean higher emissions: despite the pandemic, the CO2 output from cruises in Europe grew by 17 per cent between 2019 and 2022, while methane emissions rocketed by 500 per cent.\n\nGrassroots campaigns have sprouted in Europe and beyond to stem the tide of cruising, and some port cities have introduced their own restrictions.\n\nIn 2021, Venice, Italy, barred large cruise ships from anchoring in its historic centre, while Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona in Spain have capped the number of cruise ships allowed in daily. Amsterdam, too, recently announced plans to ban cruise ships from its city centre by 2035.\n\nBut are these restrictions enough?\n\n\"The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control,\" says Inesa Ulichina, sustainable shipping officer at T&E.\n\n\"Cruising is a luxury business and operators must take responsibility for their climate impact.

This forces companies to buy allowances to emit CO2, with heavy fines issued if they do not have enough of these to cover their output. The allowances are capped across industries.\n\nFrom 2026, it will also apply to methane and nitrous oxide emissions, with the caps gradually lowered over time.\n\nPenalties for using dirty marine fuels will also progressively increase from 2025 under the FuelEU Maritime scheme.\n\nThanks to these measures, T&E estimates that by 2030 a seven-day cruise sailing on fossil fuels would pay almost \u20ac144,000 more in fuel and penalty costs than those blending small amounts of e-methanol made from renewable hydrogen into their fuel mix.\n\nAs regulations tighten, this could rise to nearly

The group also found that the number of cruise ships has risen 20-fold since 1970.\n\n\"Today's cruisezillas make the Titanic look like a small fishing boat,\" said Inesa Ulichina, a sustainable shipping analyst at T&E.\n\nIndustry projections suggest about 35 million passengers will travel the seas on cruise ships this year - a 6% increase from pre-pandemic levels which analysts attribute to rising wealth. Research published by JP Morgan in June found that demand for cruises \"remains robust\" and noted that the cruise industry had moved beyond its core market of baby boomers to increasingly attract millennials.\n\nBut the sector has a large carbon footprint, and experts struggling to clean up the industry reacted with alarm to the T&E report. Cruise ships pumped out 17% more carbon dioxide in 2022 than they did in 2019, the report found, and methane emissions rose 500% over the same time period.\n\nStefan G\u00f6ssling, a professor at Linnaeus University in Sweden who studies tourism and the climate crisis, said cruise ships played a minor role in global tourism but that \"hardly any form of tourism is more energy-intensive than cruises - specifically in combination with a flight to the point of departure\".\n\nThe report was published as European ports deal with an influx of cruise ships during a summer marred by scorching heatwaves exacerbated by the climate crisis. As residents have complained about pollution and what they see as \"overtourism\", a handful of ports have cracked down on cruise ships. Barcelona has announced plans to join Amsterdam in taxing cruise visitors, who often only spend a few hours in the city, while Amsterdam has voted to close its central cruise terminal, as Barcelona did in October. Venice has banned big cruise ships from entering its damaged lagoon.\n\nBut the industry continues to boom. The world's largest cruise ship, the Icon of the Seas, was built in Turku, Finland, and launched in January this year by Royal Caribbean. Spread across its 20 decks are 40 restaurants, seven swimming pools, a theatre and a park. The 365-metre-long vessel can carry nearly 10,000 people and is powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) - a fuel that emits less carbon dioxide than regular marine fuel but can heat the planet more through the release of methane.\n\n\"This study demonstrates the risks of a growing cruise entertainment industry,\" said Bryan Comer, who runs the marine programme at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).\n\nCruise ships face few engineering restrictions on their size beyond the limits of the ports in which they berth. As demand for luxury travel has boomed, operators have chased economies of scale and built bigger boats.\n\nThe total lifetime revenue that can be generated by adding extra passengers is greater than the expense of building a bigger ship and hiring more crew, said Comer. \"Plus, everyone wants to have the biggest ship.\"\n\nThe biggest ship in 2000 was Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, with a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276. Since then, the average size of the 10 largest ships has doubled from 103,000 GT to 205,000 GT.\n\nThe Cruise Lines International Association (Clia), the world's largest cruise ship trade body, said the global cruise ship fleet was \"more energy efficient than ever\", with average emissions per ship having fallen 16% in the last five years. \"The vast majority of cruise ships sailing today - and scheduled to be in service well into the next decade as new ships come on line - are small to mid-size ships.\"\n\nLike planes, big ships that travel long distances cannot run on electricity because the batteries would be too heavy to carry. Experts have instead recommended they switch from burning fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives that can be synthetically produced with renewable energy.\n\nIn its roadmap for reaching net zero emissions by 2050, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects 44% of the energy needed for international shipping to come from ammonia, followed by hydrogen (19%), biofuels (19%) and methanol (3%). These currently stand at 0% today.\n\nWith green \"e-fuels\" in desperately short supply, activists have criticised cruise ships and superyachts as wasteful luxuries that should be banned outright - with some staging protests at ports in Spain, France and the UK. Others have argued that the industries are so rich they should take the lead, by spurring sorely needed investment.\n\nAlthough cruise lines have limited options to build fuel plants themselves, they could commit to buying the products made there, said G\u00f6ssling. \"But we are talking very large amounts that also require a corresponding expansion of renewable power.\"\n\nT&E called on policymakers to set up no-cruise zones in waters with fragile ecosystems and establish stricter rules for decarbonising cruise ships than non-luxury vessels. It also suggested a global tax on cruise tickets to help fund poor countries struggling to clean their economies.\n\nRoyal Caribbean did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source":

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible 50 euros (about $54) tax on a \"typical cruise journey ticket\" could potentially bring in 1.6 billion euros (around $1.75 billion) globally.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, has committed its members to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).\n\nCNN has asked CLIA for comment on the report and has also reached out to Royal Caribbean Group for comment.\n\n___\n\n7 tips for avoiding food poisoning while traveling 7 tips for avoiding food poisoning

The ship, which launched in January 2024, is longer than 15 blue whales and is five times the size of the Titanic.\n\nThe number of cruise ships has also risen 20-fold from just 21 in 1970 to more than 500 today, according to the study.\n\nT&E warned that a combination of more and bigger vessels means that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20 per cent higher in 2022 than they were in 2019 before the pandemic.\n\nIt also highlighted how industry growth has also contributed to air pollution issues on land. For example, Southampton - the UK's busiest cruise ship port - ranks seventh for the most sulphur oxide air pollution coming from cruise ships in Europe and suffers the highest levels of ship-produced emissions of both nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter of any port in the UK.\n\nThe think tank is urging cruise ship operators to invest in green technologies to reduce their environmental impact and curb their impact on local air pollution.\n\n\"With today's cruise ships making the Titanic look like somebody's private yacht, the question is - how much bigger can these giants get?\" said Jonathan Hood, UK sustainable shipping manager at T&E. \"The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are spiralling out of control.\"\n\nIn the face of backlash over their emissions, some cruise operators are switching to liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative to traditional shipping fuels like heavy fuel oil. According to T&E, LNG-powered ships make up 38 per cent of global cruise ship orders today.\n\nBut while LNG emits fewer pollutants and CO2 when burned, it still results in carbon emissions and can also release methane, which has been found to have warming impacts over 80 times more potent than CO2.\n\n\"The only solution for decarbonising maritime activities that's both sustainable and scalable is zero-emission, hydrogen-based fuels,\" said Hood. \"The UK needs to make switching away from filthy fossil fuels an absolute priority by setting binding targets for the use of clean fuels as well as for ports to support zero-emission technologies.\n\n\"That also includes shore side electricity, which allows cruise ships to plug in at berth and to switch off their polluting engines, allowing the residents of ports like Southampton to breathe easy.\"\n\nThe think tank is also urging policymakers to explore implementing a ticket tax to raise climate finance for emissions reduction projects. It argues new levies on cruise ships are justified, especially given cruise ships are currently exempt from fuel duties and most corporate and consumer taxes.\n\nT&E calculated that a \u00a342 ticket tax - less than half of UK air passenger duty for a long-haul economy-class seat - on a typical cruise ticket worth around \u00a31,180, would bring in \u00a31.37bn globally.\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest green business news by signing up to the free Daily and Weekly BusinessGreen Newsletters.", "source": {"uri": "businessgreen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessGreen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stuart_stone@businessgreen.com", "name": "Stuart Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross tonnage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Caribbean_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Caribbean International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming pool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sulfur oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_emission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zero emission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online_Grocery_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online Grocery Stores", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/cf55bf3/bbcfbd1c-25c0-4c88-80e3-a3aa673c041d/5/iStock-2033280799-600x315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800165", "eventUri": "eng-9800165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

LNG-powered ships make up 38% of global cruise ship orders today.\n\nHowever, T&E said: \"While LNG emits less pollutants and CO2 when burned, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than CO2. Methane slips from LNG engines can make these ships more harmful to the climate than traditional shipping fuels.\"\n\nT&E estimated that green e-fuels could power almost 4% of European shipping in 2030.\n\nThe limited availability of e-fuels and their refuelling infrastructure should be less of an issue for the cruise ships, as they sail on the same routes with clear schedules, making their refuelling needs and timings predictable and relatively easy to plan, according to the organisation.\n\n\"Cruise ships are currently exempt from fuel duties, corporate taxes and most of the consumer taxes that other modes of transport are subject to,\" T&E said.\n\n\"A \u20ac50 ticket tax on a typical cruise ticket would bring in \u20ac1.6 billion globally, according to the analysis.

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible 50 euros (about $54) tax on a \"typical cruise journey ticket\" could potentially bring in 1.6 billion euros (around $1.75 billion) globally.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, has committed its members to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).\n\nCNN has asked CLIA for comment on the report and has also reached out to Royal Caribbean Group for comment.\n\n___\n\n7 tips for avoiding food poisoning while traveling 7 tips for avoiding food poisoning while traveling Wash hands with soap and water Limit raw food consumption Pack some loperamide

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible 50 euros (about $54) tax on a \"typical cruise journey ticket\" could potentially bring in 1.6 billion euros (around $1.75 billion) globally.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, has committed its members to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).\n\nCNN has asked CLIA for comment on the report and has also reached out to Royal Caribbean Group for comment.\n\n___\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis

The group cites the rapid growth of the cruise industry while forecasting the introduction of \"cruisezilla\" 345,000 gross ton cruise ship carrying nearly 11,000 passengers by 2050.\n\nThe NGO released a report highlighting that with cruise vacations increasingly becoming a mainstream vacation option, particularly in developed countries, the number and size of cruise ships have risen dramatically. The result, the report asserts is an exponential increase in cruise ships' carbon emissions.\n\nThe report dubbed \"Cruisezillas\": How much bigger can cruise ships get?, highlights that cruise ships are currently exempt from fuel duties, corporate taxes, and most of the consumer taxes that other modes of transport pay. As such, the NGO calls for imposing a \u20ac50 ($55) tax on a typical cruise ticket calculating that it would generate \u20ac1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) globally. They point out that \u20ac410 million ($450 million) would be raised in Europe which could be applied to the efforts to expand the supply of green fuels. The amounts could grow to $3.3 billion with a \u20ac100 per ticket fee or $6.8 billion with \u20ac200 per ticket fee.\n\nT&E asserts that the rapid growth in the cruise industry has contributed to a dramatic increase in CO2 emissions. \"A combination of more and bigger cruise ships,\" T&E contends, \"means that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were nearly 20 percent higher in 2022 than they were in 2019.\n\nThe report calculates that in Europe, CO2 emissions from cruise ships grew by 17 percent despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and methane emissions surged by 500 percent between 2019 and 2022. Other pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and fine particles increased by nine percent, 18 percent, and 25 percent respectively around European ports during the period.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the trade group for the cruise industry, strongly contests those figures. In a statement, they cited EU data that they said shows \"cruise lines have reduced emissions by 16 percent on average per ship over the past five years.\"\n\n\"Today's cruisezillas make the Titanic look like a small fishing boat,\" said Inesa Ulichina, sustainable shipping officer at T&E. \"How much bigger can these giants get? The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nT&E highlights the transformation of the industry using data from Clarkson contending that the number of ships rose from 21 in 1970 to 515 today. They also assert that the average size of the ten largest cruise ships is double what it was 24 years ago, averaging 205,000 gross tons. The group says nearly 36 million travelers are projected to take a cruise voyage this year.\n\nIllustrating the growth, T&E points to Royal Caribbean International's Icon of the Seas, which was introduced at the start of the year as the world's biggest cruise ship. With a capacity of 7,600 passengers, the Icon of the Seas they said not only dwarfs the 2005-built Voyager of the Sea (then the largest cruise ship in the world) that has a capacity of 3,938 passengers, and they compared it to the Titanic (46,000 gross tons) which had a capacity of 2,500 passengers. Going by the current trend, T&E projects the trend will continue to \"cruisezillas\" in the range of 345,000 gross tons and nearly 11,000 passengers by 2050.\n\nThe trade group CLIA says it has concerns over \"multiple claims\" in the report. For example, they report that the majority (60 percent) of cruise ships sailing today and scheduled for service in the next decade are small-to-midsize and more energy efficient. CLIA also points to the investments being made by the industry to increase the use of sustainable fuels and new technologies.\n\nT&E acknowledges that many cruise operators are switching to LNG as an alternative to traditional shipping fuels like heavy fuel oil. They recognize that LNG-powered ships make up 38 percent of today's global cruise ship orders, but raise the concerns of methane slip.\n\nCruise ships, T&E highlights, are good candidates for green fuels despite the limited availability and challenges in bunkering for the new fuels. The NGO highlights the concerns over supply and bunkering would be less for cruise ships that sail on the same routes with clear schedules versus commercial shipping.\n\nThe report concludes by saying converting cruise ships to green fuels would also be financially beneficial for the lines. T&E points to the increasing scale of financial penalties associated with fossil fuel under the Fuel EU Maritime scheme and the financial benefits for cruise ships to lead in the green fuel transition.", "source": {"uri": "maritime-executive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maritime Executive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gross tonnage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_of_the_Seas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Icon of the Seas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_Lines_International_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise Lines International Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sulfur oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methane emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunkering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Caribbean_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Caribbean International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Consolidators", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Cruise_Ships/PortMiami-2024-cruise-ships.5e8cdb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800165", "eventUri": "eng-9800165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible 50 euros (about $54) tax on a \"typical cruise journey ticket\" could potentially bring in 1.6 billion euros (around $1.75 billion) globally.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, has committed its members to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).\n\nCNN has asked CLIA for comment on the report and has also reached out to Royal Caribbean Group for comment.\n\n___\n\n7 tips for avoiding food poisoning while traveling 7 tips for avoiding food poisoning

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible 50 euros (about $54) tax on a \"typical cruise journey ticket\" could potentially bring in 1.6 billion euros (around $1.75 billion) globally.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, has committed its members to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).\n\nCNN has

Modern Cruise Ships Now Dwarf the Titanic", "body": "The number and size of cruise ships globally has doubled since the start of the millennium, T&E's new 'Cruisezillas: How much bigger can cruise ships get?' report reveals. If they continue to grow at this rate, the biggest cruise ships in 2050 could be a staggering 345,000 gross tonnage, making them almost eight times bigger than the Titanic.\n\nIn January 2024, the world's largest cruise ship to date, the Icon of the Seas, was launched. The floating city contains 40 restaurants, seven swimming pools and can carry 7,600 passengers. It is longer than 15 blue whales and five times bigger than the Titanic.\n\nThe largest ship built before 2005, Voyager of the Sea, was able to carry 3,938 passengers.\n\nToday, the average size of the 10 largest cruise ships is double what it was 24 years ago, averaging 205,000 GT. Additionally, the global cruise industry has boomed over the past half a century, with the number of ships rising 20-fold from only 21 in 1970 to 515 today.\n\nA combination of more and bigger cruise ships means that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were nearly 20% higher in 2022 than they were in 2019 before the pandemic, and T&E calls on cruise liners to invest in green technologies to reduce their impact on the planet and local air pollution.\n\nMany cruise operators are switching to LNG, and LNG-powered ships make up 38% of global cruise ship orders today. While LNG emits less pollutants and CO2 when burned, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than CO2.\n\nGreen e-fuels could power almost 4% of European shipping in 2030, a recent T&E study shows. The limited availability of e-fuels and their bunkering infrastructure should be less of an issue for the cruise ships, says T&E, as they sail on the same routes with clear schedules, making their fuel refueling needs and timings predictable and relatively easy to plan.\n\nIt can also be financially beneficial for cruise operators to switch to green fuels, the latest study shows. Due to the EU's carbon price on ships which took effect from the beginning of this year, and progressively increasing FuelEU Maritime penalties for using the dirtiest shipping fuels from 2025, sailing only on fossil fuel will become 13% more expensive than blending 4% of e-methanol into the fuel mix in 2030. The cost increase when sailing on fossil fuel compared to blending e-fuels could reach more than 30% in 2040 and over 80% in 2050.\n\nCruise ships are currently exempt from fuel duties, corporate taxes and most of the consumer taxes that other modes of transport are subject to. A \u20ac50 ticket tax on a typical cruise ticket would bring in \u20ac1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) globally, according to the analysis. This could provide crucial climate finance and ensure that luxury forms of travel are taxed, says T&E.", "source": {"uri": "marinelink.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarineLink"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_tonnage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gross tonnage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_of_the_Seas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon of the Seas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HarperCollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming pool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrofuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrofuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunkering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online_Grocery_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online Grocery Stores", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Nautical", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Nautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-te-152278.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800165", "eventUri": "eng-9800165", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible 50 euros (about $54) tax on a \"typical cruise journey ticket\" could potentially bring in 1.6 billion euros (around $1.75 billion) globally.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, has committed its members to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).\n\nCNN has asked CLIA for comment on the report and has also reached out to Royal Caribbean Group for comment.\n\n7 tips for avoiding food poisoning while traveling 7 tips for avoiding food poisoning while

How much bigger can these giants get?\"\n\nWhile it's not certain the ships will grow so large, there are few technical reasons why they can't, other than perhaps port sizes.\n\nIn January this year the world's largest cruise ship, the gargantuan Icon Of The Seas, set sail.\n\nThe hulking vessel is five times bigger than the Titanic and carries 40 restaurants, seven swimming pools, and 7,600 passengers.\n\nTourists from the UK and Ireland love a cruise, taking 2.3 million luxury cruise holidays last year, well up from the 1.7 million in 2022.

The cruise business is the fastest growing tourism sector and its emissions are quickly getting out of control.\"\n\nThe number of cruise ships in existence has increased by 20-fold from 21 in 1970 to 515 today, according to T&E.\n\nOn its launch in 1999, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, which has a gross tonnage (GT) of 137,276, was the biggest cruise ship in the world.\n\nThe cruise line brand's 1,198-foot Icon of the Seas, which has seven swimming pools and a record-breaking 17,000-square-foot water park, became the world's biggest cruise ship -- with a gross tonnage of 248,663 -- when it launched in January 2024.\n\nBut the speed at which the cruising industry has boomed in recent years has come at a price, T&E says in its report.\n\nIt notes that CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe were almost 20% higher in 2022 than in 2019.\n\nCruise ships and other maritime vessels are thought to be responsible for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the International Maritime Organization.\n\nWhile cruise ships are exempt from fuel duties, along with most corporate and consumer taxes, at present, the report points out that a possible 50 euros (about $54) tax on a \"typical cruise journey ticket\" could potentially bring in 1.6 billion euros (around $1.75 billion) globally.\n\nCruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest cruise industry trade association, has committed its members to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and to reducing carbon rates by 40% by 2030 (as compared to 2008 levels).\n\nCNN has asked CLIA for comment on the report and has also reached out to Royal Caribbean Group for comment.\n\n___\n\n7 tips for avoiding food poisoning while traveling Wash hands with soap and water Avoid

A recent report released by climate advocacy group Transport & Environment projects the world's largest cruise ship will be eight times larger than the Titanic by 2050. Admittedly, we're already past the halfway point. Royal Caribbean launched Icon of The Seas in January and the behemoth vessel is five times heavier than the sunken 1910s ocean liner.\n\nThe 2050 projection is based on the astronomic growth that the cruise industry has seen in the 21st century. In 2000, there were 222 cruise ships on the seas. Today, that figure is now 515 ships. The demand to sail on cruises has shown no sign of ceasing. Over the same time period, the number of passengers has risen from 7.5 million to 30 million, according to Cruise Market Watch. The T&E report summarized what kind of impact this would have on the environment:\n\n\"As a result of such rapid growth, these floating cities will emit more greenhouse gases and pollutants than ever before. Between 2019 and 2022, CO2 emissions from cruise ships in Europe grew by 17% despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and methane emissions surged by 500 percent.\"\n\nThe report also notes that over half of the cruise industry's passenger capacity is on these mega-ships, vessels that can carry more than 3,500 passengers. The Icon of the Seas can carry 7,500 paying customers and the hypothetical 2050 behemoth would be able to hold 10,500 passengers.\n\nT&E suggests that the cruise industry should be incentivized to use cleaner fuels to reduce emissions and prohibited from sailing into environmentally vulnerable areas. The group also wants a tax on cruise tickets to fund climate projects, a respectable method to create some good off of stern-suspended infinity pools and endless margarita bars.\n\nHowever, the policy proposals don't impact all the areas where cruises aren't sustainable, like when all of its passengers swarm seaside tourist destinations. In Europe, Amsterdam and Venice have already imposed restrictions on cruise operators.

LNG-powered ships make up 38% of global cruise ship orders today. While LNG emits less pollutants and CO2 when burned, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than CO2. Methane slips from LNG engines can make these ships more harmful to the climate than traditional shipping fuels.\n\nInesa Ulichina, added: \"The only green and scalable solution for decarbonising maritime activities is e-fuels. Cruising is a luxury business and operators must take responsibility for their climate impact. If they want to avoid becoming increasingly unwanted visitors, they must clean up their act.\"\n\nGreen e-fuels could power almost 4% of European shipping in 2030, a recent T&E study shows. The limited availability of e-fuels and their bunkering infrastructure should be less of an issue for the cruise ships, says T&E, as they sail on the same routes with clear schedules, making their fuel refuelling needs and timings predictable and relatively easy to plan.\n\nIt can also be financially beneficial for cruise operators to switch to green fuels, the latest study shows. Due to the EU's carbon price on ships which took effect from the beginning of this year, and progressively increasing FuelEU Maritime penalties for using the dirtiest shipping fuels from 2025, sailing only on fossil fuel will become 13% more expensive than blending 4% of e-methanol into the fuel mix in 2030. The cost increase when sailing on fossil fuel compared to blending e-fuels could reach more than 30% in 2040 and over 80% in 2050.\n\nCruise ships are currently exempt from fuel duties, corporate taxes and most of the consumer taxes that other modes of transport are subject to. A \u20ac50 ticket tax on a typical cruise ticket would bring in \u20ac1.6 billion globally, according to the analysis.

Green travel lobby group Transport & Environment (T&E) compiled the study based on data from shipping consultants Clarksons.\n\nCruising is already the fastest-expanding tourism industry, with enthusiasm for luxury trips on the water accelerating since Covid as passengers splurge on so-called experiential travel.\n\nJonathan Hood, T&E's UK manager for sustainable shipping, said: \"With today's cruise ships making the Titanic look like somebody's private yacht, the question is, how much much bigger can these giants get?\"\n\nThe global cruise ship fleet has already increased 20-fold since 1970, when the industry emerged from an ocean liner trade largely killed off by the advent of large passenger jets.\n\nThe Icon of the Seas, operated by Royal Caribbean and the largest vessel to date, made its maiden voyage from Miami in January and is five times the size of the Titanic. It features 20 decks, 40 restaurants, seven swimming pools and can carry 7,600 passengers.\n\nModern cruising offers far more variety than the early days of the industry, when hours lounging in deckchairs were the order of the day, punctuated by whistle-stop tours ashore. Evenings meant buffets, a cabaret and perhaps a place at the captain's table.\n\nSmaller vessels now offer cultural itineraries and wildlife-viewing expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic, accompanied by scientists and natural history experts. Virgin Voyages, launched in 2021, is targeting a less elderly clientele with adults-only cruises advertised as a \"playground for your inner child\".\n\nT&E said that carbon emissions from cruise ships are becoming an increasing issue and are already 20pc higher than in 2019.

Their predictions included to expect more legal protections for AI with a new government report coming this summer, harder-to-spot deepfakes and more. Ghaith Mahmood, a partner at law firm Latham & Watkins, explained the intricacies of what can be copyrighted and what can\u2019t \u2014 and how quickly that\u2019s likely to change. \u201cTo be copyrightable [content] must be authored by a human,\u201d Mahmood said. \u201cBut I do think we\u2019re on shifting sands,\u201d ahead of the U.S. Copyright Office issuing a new report this summer. Mahmood showed the sold-out crowd an elaborate AI-generated \u201cspace opera\u201d drawing created by Jason M. Allen, using at least 624 prompts. Allen applied for a copyright in 2022 and was turned down, as the Copyright Office determined that it did not fit the \u201chuman authorship requirement.\u201d \u201cThe words you wrote for the prompts, that\u2019s copyrightable, but the picture itself is not,\u201d Mahmood explained of the current standard. Deepfakes are getting harder to spot Lori McCreary cofounded Revelations Entertainment with Morgan Freeman and said she\u2019s always been able to spot deepfakes of the Oscar-winning actor and his inimitable voice \u2014 until recently. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much the arbiter of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not,\u201d the CEO said of a video shared with her three weeks ago, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t tell you whether we shot it or didn\u2019t shoot it.\u201d She checked with Freeman and the makeup artist, both of whom said they had no idea it existed. \u201cThat\u2019s where we are now\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t even have known it wasn\u2019t Morgan if I wasn\u2019t working with Morgan,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really scary, because it\u2019s this age of disinformation, the age of putting words in anyone\u2019s mouth \u2014 it makes me frightened.\u201d Expect more legal AI protections Mahmood pointed out that currently, there is no federal AI act as there is in Europe. However, he said to expect more laws like the Elvis Act, which just passed in Tennessee. That law makes it illegal to create a highly similar likeness to, specifically, Elvis Presley. Blockchain technology might be used to track original content Renard T. Jenkins \u2014 a former Warner Bros. Discovery exec who\u2019s now president and CEO of I2A2 Technologies, Labs and Studios \u2014 said his company is working to help create an infrastructure to help with authenticating content. \u201cBack in the old days, you had watermarks,\u201d he said, noting that file-based content can be altered to remove information about the original creator. \u201cWhat we are attempting to do is create an infrastructure and ecosystem that would allow us to track every single iteration of a piece of content from its origins all the way through the distribution.\u201d For that to happen, the PGA and other organizations would have to agree to a new standard. \u201cIt\u2019s a very heavy lift,\u201d he said, comparing the necessary level of cooperation to a cross-mafia agreement, describing it as the \u201cfive families of Hollywood coming together.\u201d He also suggested that blockchain technology could be used to \u201caudit and track\u201d every change to a piece of content. It\u2019s the same tech used for Bitcoin and the much-maligned NFT digital assets. Humans still need to be in the mix Jenkins said that when he asked ChatGPT to write a resume for him, it did a great job \u2014 except for the part where it credited him with a nonexistent Oscar win. \u201cWhile I was happy to hear that,\u201d he joked, \u201cit was totally wrong.\u201d He also shared anecdotes about AI citing books that don\u2019t exist. After discussing how AI translations into other languages don\u2019t take into account localization, Jenkins added that people need to act as AI editors. \u201cA human needs to be in the loop to make sure it\u2019s right.\u201d Prompt engineers will be the \u201cEnglish major\u2019s revenge\u201d \u201cI like to say, because I\u2019m married to an English major, that [prompt engineers will be the] English major\u2019s\u2019 revenge,\u201d Jenkins said of the term for those with deeper experience and skill in crafting specific language to give to generative AI tools. \u201cThey are going to be the ones who really understand how to use this language.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Renard T.

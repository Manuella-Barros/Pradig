Why, then, does reaching out to someone you don\u2019t know, making platonic connections in the modern world, feel like such a bold, even brave thing to do? Let me tell you about my friend, Pauline. Like all good friends, we make a point of catching up at least once a week, talking for hours about everything and nothing at all. But Pauline and I, while always there for each other, are unlike more conventional companions because, as well as being born 50-odd years apart, and living several hundred miles from each other, we\u2019ve never actually met. We\u2019re telephone friends. It was the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and I was watching cat videos on YouTube. An advert popped up \u2013 an older-person charity seeking to combat social isolation through weekly telephone calls. Thirty minutes a week was the commitment. A simple chat could change an older person\u2019s life, so they said. There were rules, of course. You were only to speak on the phone, only to know each other\u2019s first names, never to meet in real life. Now I volunteer for several elderly charities, but back then I hadn\u2019t given much thought to it. Yet the idea immediately appealed. Perhaps it was an age thing. I had just turned 30, a milestone no one can fail to ignore, and I was beginning to wonder what mark I was leaving on the world, what my future held, who I was. And then there was Covid, of course. It\u2019s no coincidence that this all started in 2020. Was it a sense of privilege I felt during the pandemic that drove me to sign up for these calls? Was I trying to cleanse my own conscience? A young man in a nice flat with a nice boyfriend, never going without food, or employment or, for that matter, company. I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only one who found myself pondering those big existential questions during those difficult weeks, months (years, wasn\u2019t it?). It was around that time that I\u2019d taken a break from my work in television to finish writing my novel, as indulgent as that sounds, and I had some time on my hands, to put it lightly. And so, after completing various vetting procedures, security checks and training programmes, the calls began. of television?\u201d I ask. \u201cOf course!\u201d Pauline answers. \u201cI never have the telly off! It\u2019s become a kind of friend. What do you watch?\u201d She\u2019d beaten me to it. I\u2019d built a mental crib sheet of shows I assumed she would watch in preparation for the call: Countryfile; Cash in the Attic; Countdown. I\u2019d watched them all the previous week in case the conversation dried up. \u201cI watch reality TV.\u201d Pauline announces. \u201c I like Made in Chelsea.\u201d I spit my coffee out. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cOf course. I watch it on E4. And that other one in Essex. Haven\u2019t missed an ep of that.\u201d On paper it shouldn\u2019t really work, of course. Our lives are poles apart. And yet, despite all our apparent differences, there is more that unites Pauline and me than divides us. Somehow it does work. A few months in and there\u2019s little we haven\u2019t discussed. And not just what we\u2019re watching on the telly, but memories from our past, dreams for our future. With every call we get to know each other a little better, become more comfortable revealing a little more of ourselves. But how sad, I think, that it took a national pandemic for this to happen. This friendship, and countless others across the country, would never have blossomed without it. \u201cMy cat, Muriel,\u201d I say, one day, \u201cshe turned five yesterday. We threw her a party. She tried some Pawsecco. It\u2019s nettle and ginseng, lightly carbonated. I sound mad, don\u2019t I?\u201d There is a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear you sounding more yourself,\u201d she cuts in, out of nowhere. \u201cIs it the tablets?\u201d \u201cSorry?\u201d \u201cThe tablets you told me about \u2013 are you feeling better? Happier?\u201d It was a few weeks earlier that I found myself divulging my mental health struggles to Pauline over the phone. I\u2019m usually quite reluctant to talk about such things, even with my closest friends, but perhaps that\u2019s one of the perks of a telephone friendship, not having to look another person in the eye. \u201cI think so,\u201d I reply, tentatively, though I know it is true, I am feeling much more myself, but there is something about the fact that it is coming from Pauline that floors me somehow. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve noticed, Pauline. I\u2019m feeling much better. Thank you.\u201d There is a straightforwardness to our relationship, I realise, a connection deeper than I could have imagined when I first signed up for these calls. I guess sometimes in life we\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re looking for until it presents itself right under our eyes or, in my case, ears. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Pauline says, \u201cbut the other day I was talking to a man from the electricity board and I got on to you. I called you my friend. Is that OK?\u201d \u201cOf course you\u2019re my friend,\u201d I reply, but it is only as I say the words that I realise it is true. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t take comfort in knowing that someone is there for me, as much as I am for them. Someone who is always at the other end of the phone. Real friendships aren\u2019t transactional or philanthropic. They are mutually beneficial. Life enriching. Pauline sighs deeply and I hear her shake her head. \u201cIf only I had more gays in my life.\u201d I start to laugh. She is forever extolling the virtues of homosexuals. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019ve always had an affinity with gay people. Men, and women.\u201d I smile into the phone. \u201cThere\u2019s another name for someone like you, Pauline.\u201d \u201cThere is?\u201d \u201cYes, and it rhymes with bag nag.\u201d There have been many moments that have been anything but sweet. Thinking about her situation one day, during one of our chats, I am overwhelmed by her confinement, the cruelty of it all, and a thought enters my head, one that I\u2019ve yet to fully consider. What happens when Pauline is no longer with us? When I ring and there is no answer? \u201cAre you still there?\u201d \u201cSam?\u201d \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d There is an ugly guttural cry that comes out of me that I can\u2019t control. I grab the pillow I am leaning against and press my face into it, suppressing all the rage, the sadness, the shame of it all. It is a sickness in our society, I think. Where older people are invisible and neighbours are nuisances and no one cares for anyone but themselves. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something a bit cheerier,\u201d Pauline suggests, and suddenly it is her comforting me. \u201cHow\u2019s Tom?\u201d At the mention of my partner, a smile appears on my face. I smile. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lovely accent, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cHe has,\u201d I reply. \u201cAren\u2019t I lucky?\u201d The previous week she\u2019d overheard Tom on the phone to his mum, while we sat together on the sofa. \u201cAnd am I allowed to say that there is something very attractive about an Irish accent?\u201d \u201cYou are,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd there is. It\u2019s like butter, Pauline. You should hear the things he whispers in my ear.\u201d There is a naughty cackle down the phone. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not just me then.\u201d \u201cWhat do you look like, Pauline? I\u2019ve never seen you, have I? We only know each other\u2019s voices.\u201d I regret the question immediately. In all the hundreds of hours we\u2019ve been speaking, I had unconsciously painted an image of Pauline in my mind and I was reluctant to have that image shattered. \u201cI know what,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I used to look like.\u201d I feel myself exhale. \u201cI had long blond hair, reddish blonde, really, and a heart-shaped face. Hazel eyes, a dainty little nose, and a cupid\u2019s bow mouth. Everyone used to comment on my neck \u2013 it was long, like a swan\u2019s. And I used to wear a lot of jewellery \u2013 no point now, of course.\u201d I beam into the receiver, closing my eyes to try to imagine her. \u201cI should let you get on,\u201d I add, realising what a ridiculous thing it is to say. \u201cYou will ring again when you get a moment?\u201d \u201cI will! Why would I stop calling?\u201d This has gone beyond volunteering, I realise. It\u2019s been almost four years. Hundreds of hours of conversation. Countless stories. Laughter. Secrets. And now tears. It\u2019s no longer charity, if it ever was. We\u2019re friends, simple as that. I will keep calling Pauline, of course I will. I will keep calling until she doesn\u2019t pick up.

What you need to know about the symptoms.", "body": "Dengue fever is a potentially deadly viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes that is currently spreading across Europe.\n\nAustin and Travis County already have had five cases of dengue fever this summer, according to Austin Public Health.\n\nThat might surprise you. While Central Texas is used to hearing about the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, dengue fever is not typically on our radar.\n\nAustin Public Health has notified the medical community to be on the lookout for these viruses this summer. This notification follows a warning from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the world and the U.S. are seeing a high number of cases. In the U.S., 2,559 cases of dengue fever in 45 states or territories have been detected this year. Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are all seeing cases that were contracted locally, not from travel.\n\nLearn more: More mosquitoes test positive for West Nile virus in Austin. Find out where.\n\nWhat causes dengue fever?\n\nDengue fever is a collection of viruses that are spread by the bite of an Aedes mosquito. These mosquitoes also spread Zika and Chikungunya, but they are different than the ones that spread West Nile or the ones that spread malaria.\n\nWe do have the Aedes mosquitoes in Texas, as well as the mosquitoes that can carry West Nile virus. Already this summer, Florida has reported nine cases of dengue in people who had not traveled outside the country.\n\nThe United States typically does not have the mosquitoes that cause malaria, but with warmer temperatures, malaria mosquitoes are starting to move into the country. Last summer, Brownsville had a case of malaria that wasn't from travel, and Florida had this type of malaria case as well.\n\nRead more: Avian flu, H5N1, has been found in Austin wastewater. How can you protect yourself?\n\nWhere are people getting dengue from?\n\nSo far, all five cases of dengue in Travis County have come from people who have traveled, said Heather Cooks-Sinclair, the manager of epidemiology and disease surveillance at Austin Public Health. She said they had visited areas where dengue is endemic, such as Central and South America, India and Asia.\n\nOnce a patient with dengue is identified in Travis County, Austin Public Health does an investigation to make sure the patient did not got dengue from being bitten by a mosquito locally.\n\nIs Austin Public Health looking for dengue?\n\nCurrently, Texas and Austin Public Health are testing mosquito pools for West Nile virus.\n\nThey have not added dengue fever to the tests yet, but Cooks-Sinclair said there is a plan in place to switch into more active surveillance if a locally acquired case is discovered in Travis County.\n\nRead more: How to avoid mosquito, ant bites, bee stings and how to treat them when they happen\n\nCould dengue start being spread by mosquitoes in Texas?\n\nBecause we do have the Aedes mosquitoes here, Cooks-Sinclair said, dengue could be spread locally. If a person who contracted a dengue virus while traveling was then bitten by an Aedes mosquito here, that mosquito could then spread that virus to another person it bites.\n\nBrownsville has had occasional outbreaks of locally acquired dengue in recent years, Cooks-Sinclair said, because of that scenario.\n\nMost people get dengue from a mosquito bite. It is also possible for a mother to spread dengue to her baby during pregnancy. Dengue has been associated with low birth weight, premature birth and the death of the fetus.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of dengue?\n\nMost people, as much as 80%, who have dengue have no symptoms, Cooks-Sinclair said.\n\nThose who do have nonspecific symptoms such as a fever, a headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, aches and pains in the joints, eyes, muscles or bones.\n\nDoctors typically run a blood test for dengue after no other cause can explain the symptoms and if they know someone has traveled recently.\n\nOnly about 5% of the people with dengue symptoms have severe symptoms -- frequent vomiting, vomiting blood, bloody stool, belly pain, bleeding from the nose or gums, or extreme fatigue -- that are a medical emergency and require hospitalization.\n\nHow is dengue treated?\n\nThere is not a specific treatment for dengue fever, but doctors manage the symptoms by using fever reducers and encouraging fluids. Most symptoms begin within two weeks of being bitten and last two to seven days.\n\nThere is a vaccine, but it is typically given to people who live in an area with a lot of dengue cases.\n\nHow can I avoid dengue if I'm traveling?\n\nWhether traveling or staying at home, practice all the same precautions as with West Nile virus:", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Last year, dengue situation turned so severe that several members of a family got infected at a time. This would not have happened if necessary measures had been taken. There are fears this year as well. So, if timely measures are taken, the risk of dengue will be reduced.\"\n\nMunni Akhter's daughter Mantasha is 10 years old. Last year, she was severely affected by dengue.\n\nPlatelets came down to 10,000 and her liver was affected. Although she somehow survived, the doctors said to be careful for the rest of his life. If she gets dengue for a second time, she may not be saved.\n\n\"We got afraid when she caught a fever. Because, last year I saw the horror of dengue,\" said Munni.\n\nThis raises question as to how well preared the authorities are to tackle another possible outbreak.\n\nDengue cases, fatalities in last five years:\n\nAccording to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), the number of dengue patients was 10,148 in 2018 with fatalities reported at 26.\n\nIn 2019, dengue cases increased to 1,01,354 with 179 deaths. In 2020 1,405 cases and 7 deaths were recorded. There were 28,429 cases and 105 deaths in 2021 while the cases climbed to 62,382 in 2022 with deaths 281.\n\nIn 2023, considered as the deadliest year, the number of cases soared to 321,179 with 1,705 people deaths.\n\nUntil July 7 this year, DGHS recorded 3978 cases and 46 deaths, raising concern about another possible outbreak.\n\nDGHS's preparations to cope with Dengue:\n\nAccording to the DGHS, it has taken an action plan for 2024 based on the National Dengue Prevention & Control Strategy (2024-2030).\n\nInstructions for prevention and control of dengue have been shared with all government hospitals before the start of the season and the hospitals are well prepared, it said.\n\nIt said it has strengthened surveillance by introducing Dengue Tracker for real time data collection (with actual address and avoid duplication).\n\nFocal points for secondary and tertiary hospitals were identified and WhatsApp group was opened for quick communication and actions.\n\nTrained doctors and paramedics are in place for proper patient management in the hospitals, it said.\n\nDengue test kits are available in all government hospital (12 lakh kits distributed).\n\nHealth and Family Welfare Minister Samanta Lal Sen has given necessary instructions to all government hospitals for procurement of adequate fluid.\n\nAn awareness and community engagement campaign was launched (formation of RCCE platform messages from the health minister, the state minister and the health secretary).\n\nHow prepared the health authorities are to tackle the upcoming dengue season\n\nWhat officials concerned and experts say:\n\nDhaka South City Corporation's Chief Health Officer Fazle Shamsul Kabir said this week, \"We are in a much better position this year than the previous year. In June last year, there were 1,713 dengue patients in Dhaka South City and in June ,2024, we have 97 dengue patients.\n\n\"We carry out larviciding in the morning to destroy breeding grounds and conduct fogging activities in the afternoon. It continues all the year round except on Fridays.\"\n\nAsked if the dengue cases may spike during the monsoon, he said, \"Yes, it may increase. As part of preparations, we are trying to make people aware of it through miking, distributing leaflets, holding public awareness meetings in the wards. Most of the places where Aedes mosquitoes breed are in people's homes. So people have to be aware. It is not possible for the city corporation alone to enter every person's house. So we are working to make people aware. Besides, our mayor held meetings with government, semi-government and autonomous bodies. He instructed them how to prevent dengue. Those who do not abide by the government instructions even after warning, we fine them through mobile courts.\"\n\nEntomologist and Researcher of Jahangirnagar University Professor Dr. Kabirul Bashar Bashar said earlier it was thought that Aedes mosquitoes do not breed in drain water but some recent studies and laboratory research say that Aedes mosquitoes also breed in stagnant gutter water.\n\n\"I didn't agree to this study until the World Health Organization said so,\" he said. However, \"we spray pesticides in drains, sinks, canals and waterbodies. '\n\nDr Kabirul Bashar said this year, dengue has not yet taken a serious turn but the cases may spike from the end of July.\n\n\"What we need to do is using pesticides to destroy Adese mosquitoes' breeding ground in both DNCC and DSCC areas.\"\n\nDengue is spreading to other districts including Barguna, Barisal, Pirojpur, Cox's Bazar and so preparations should be taken at district level to prevent the disease.\n\nBrigadier General Md Asaduzzaman, director of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, told UNB that hospitals mainly focus on treatment.\n\n\"As preparation, we have a dedicated dengue ward. We have enough saline in stock as there was a severe saline crisis last year. Mosquito nets have been provided in the dengue ward. Besides, fogging and larveciding are being done in the surrounding areas so that mosquitoes cannot breed.\"\n\nHealth Minister Dr Samanta Lal Sen told parliament on June 25 that 'Dengue Focal Person' has been appointed in all Government Medical College Hospitals and District Headquarters Hospitals of the country, through whom stock and demand of dengue test kits, IV fluid (saline) and other logistics are being collected regularly for the treatment of dengue patients across the country.\n\nTo ensure the treatment of dengue patients, some 2,15,752 liters of IV fluid (saline), 8,87,569 saline sets, 26,135 mosquito nets and 1,01,159 dengue test kits were kept in 54 hospitals of different districts of the country.\n\nBesides, he said that Dengue Test Kit (NS-1) of 8,51,514, Combo IgG & IgM Test kit -1600 and Dengue RNA Diagnostic Kit 1100 provided by the Chinese government were stored in CMSD.\n\nBesides, some 55,000 bags of Ringer's Lactate Saline were stocked at CMSD with the help of WHO.

What you need to know about the symptoms.", "body": "Austin and Travis County already have had five cases of dengue fever this summer, according to Austin Public Health.\n\nThat might surprise you. While Central Texas is used to hearing about the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, dengue fever is not typically on our radar.\n\nAustin Public Health has notified the medical community to be on the lookout for these viruses this summer. This notification follows a warning from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the world and the U.S. are seeing a high number of cases. In the U.S., 2,559 cases of dengue fever in 45 states or territories have been detected this year. Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are all seeing cases that were contracted locally, not from travel.\n\nLearn more: More mosquitoes test positive for West Nile virus in Austin. Find out where.\n\nDengue fever is a collection of viruses that are spread by the bite of an Aedes mosquito. These mosquitoes also spread Zika and Chikungunya, but they are different than the ones that spread West Nile or the ones that spread malaria.\n\nWe do have the Aedes mosquitoes in Texas, as well as the mosquitoes that can carry West Nile virus. Already this summer, Florida has reported nine cases of dengue in people who had not traveled outside the country.\n\nThe United States typically does not have the mosquitoes that cause malaria, but with warmer temperatures, malaria mosquitoes are starting to move into the country. Last summer, Brownsville had a case of malaria that wasn't from travel, and Florida had this type of malaria case as well.\n\nRead more: Avian flu, H5N1, has been found in Austin wastewater. How can you protect yourself?\n\nSo far, all five cases of dengue in Travis County have come from people who have traveled, said Heather Cooks-Sinclair, the manager of epidemiology and disease surveillance at Austin Public Health. She said they had visited areas where dengue is endemic, such as Central and South America, India and Asia.\n\nOnce a patient with dengue is identified in Travis County, Austin Public Health does an investigation to make sure the patient did not got dengue from being bitten by a mosquito locally.\n\nCurrently, Texas and Austin Public Health are testing mosquito pools for West Nile virus.\n\nThey have not added dengue fever to the tests yet, but Cooks-Sinclair said there is a plan in place to switch into more active surveillance if a locally acquired case is discovered in Travis County.\n\nRead more: How to avoid mosquito, ant bites, bee stings and how to treat them when they happen\n\nBecause we do have the Aedes mosquitoes here, Cooks-Sinclair said, dengue could be spread locally. If a person who contracted a dengue virus while traveling was then bitten by an Aedes mosquito here, that mosquito could then spread that virus to another person it bites.\n\nBrownsville has had occasional outbreaks of locally acquired dengue in recent years, Cooks-Sinclair said, because of that scenario.\n\nMost people get dengue from a mosquito bite. It is also possible for a mother to spread dengue to her baby during pregnancy. Dengue has been associated with low birth weight, premature birth and the death of the fetus.\n\nMost people, as much as 80%, who have dengue have no symptoms, Cooks-Sinclair said.\n\nThose who do have nonspecific symptoms such as a fever, a headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, aches and pains in the joints, eyes, muscles or bones.\n\nDoctors typically run a blood test for dengue after no other cause can explain the symptoms and if they know someone has traveled recently.\n\nOnly about 5% of the people with dengue symptoms have severe symptoms -- frequent vomiting, vomiting blood, bloody stool, belly pain, bleeding from the nose or gums, or extreme fatigue -- that are a medical emergency and require hospitalization.\n\nThere is not a specific treatment for dengue fever, but doctors manage the symptoms by using fever reducers and encouraging fluids. Most symptoms begin within two weeks of being bitten and last two to seven days.\n\nThere is a vaccine, but it is typically given to people who live in an area with a lot of dengue cases.\n\nWhether traveling or staying at home, practice all the same precautions as with West Nile virus:", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As of July 6, Delhi recorded over 256 dengue cases, which is nearly double of the 136 cases recorded in the corresponding period in 2023 and the highest since 2020, according to the report's data. In previous years, the number of dengue cases stood at 153 in 2022, 38 in 2021, and 22 in 2020.\n\nAlso Read: Delhi Health Minister Chairs Meeting Over Preparedness Against Dengue, Malaria\n\nThe highest number of dengue cases were recorded in the Najafgarh Zone, the report said. No deaths due to the vector-borne disease have been reported so far this year.\n\nLast year, 19 deaths occurred due to dengue, the second-highest since 2020.\n\nA senior civic body official said,\n\nThe rise in the number of cases this year is because more testing centres have started collecting samples and reporting the dengue cases to the civic body. Until last year, there were about 36 testing centres. Now, this number has increased to 900 because of which the numbers appear to be inflated.\n\nThe peak season for dengue is yet to arrive in Delhi and the situation will call for urgent attention when the monsoon advances, providing a suitable atmosphere for mosquito breeding to increase significantly, the official said.\n\nUsually, it takes about 10-15 days for a larva to become an adult mosquito that spreads dengue. The MCD is taking various measures to curb breeding at the source, another official said.\n\nAccording to the report, in areas under the jurisdiction of other agencies like New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), Delhi Cantt and Railways, around 10 dengue cases were reported as of July 6.\n\nThe report also shows data on other vector-borne diseases. The number of malaria cases reported until the end of last week stood at 90, while chikungunya cases were logged at 22.\n\nThe MCD conducted over 1.8 crore house visits to check for domestic mosquito breeding and found breeding in over 43,000 houses, the report said. It has issued nearly 40,000 legal notices and challans for violating the Malaria and other Vector Borne Diseases Bye-Laws 1975 Act, it added.\n\nAlso Read: Prevent Breeding Of Aedes Mosquitoes: Tamil Nadu Health Department To District Health Officers On National Dengue Day\n\nFree Testing and Treatment\n\nThe Karnataka government has said that all testing and treatment will be provided free for Dengue fever cases at all healthcare centres under the Department of Health and Family Welfare. Setting up of 'Dengue war room' both at state and district level, constituting district level task force, identification of hotspots, activation of fever clinics, distribution of mosquito repellents, are among the instructions given by the department in a circular, to district administrations for strict compliance.\n\nThe circular read,\n\nConsidering the current Dengue situation in the state during the current monsoon season, it is crucial that measures implemented with regard to treatment and management of Dengue cases are result-oriented. In this regard, instructions are being issued for strict compliance.\n\nAs per health department data, Karnataka has till Wednesday recorded 7,840 dengue positive cases since January this year, with areas coming under the city civic body, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) accounting for the largest at 2,292 .\n\nOn Wednesday, the state reported 293 fresh dengue infection cases, including 118 in BBMP areas.\n\nThe circular said,\n\nAll testing and treatment facilities (including ICU if needed) shall be provided free of cost for all Dengue fever cases (irrespective of BPL/APL status of patient) in all health care facilities which are under Department of Health & Family Welfare.\n\nNoting that all the houses should be covered for source reduction once in a fortnight through ASHA and health staff, it said, the health staff can be supplemented by volunteers, especially in urban areas.\n\nThe volunteers are to be engaged by Urban Local Bodies at Rs 200 per day.\n\nIt also said, the campaign for source reduction with appropriate IEC (Information,Education and Communication) on dengue fever prevention and treatment would be undertaken with active involvement of elected representatives, citizens and other allied departments in the forenoon on every Friday (or any other day as decided by the District Task Force) wherein the public would be motivated to take up cleanliness drive inside and outside of their houses as well as empty and scrub clean water storage containers.\n\nAlso Read: Sea Surface Temperatures Of Indian Ocean Could Help Predict Dengue Outbreaks Globally: Study\n\nDistrict administrations and BBMP should identify hotspots (an area with a radius of about 100 meters within which two or more dengue positive cases have been reported).\n\nThe health department said efforts should be to reduce the number of hotspots through intensification of source reduction activity in such areas, through mass spraying of larvicide in outdoor areas where water stagnation points are noticed, and fogging in indoors.\n\nEnsure activation of fever clinics in such areas, it said, and asked authorities to ensure distribution of mosquito repellent neem oil or suitable alternatives in such areas for external application on exposed body parts like hands, legs, neck, face, etc to the poor households.\n\nIt also called for monitoring positive cases daily for 14 days from onset of symptoms, and to educate them about early warning signs of the mild dengue disease progressing to moderate/severe stage.\n\nA minimum of five beds in taluk hospitals and 8-10 beds in district hospitals shall be earmarked for Dengue fever cases, it said.\n\nHowever, these beds could be utilised for other patients in case they are not fully used for dengue patients.\n\nTesting kits, essential drugs and IV fluids for treatment and management of dengue cases shall be kept well stocked in all Health care facilities, the circular further said, adding that it shall be ensured that platelets, fresh frozen plasma and other blood components are available in sufficient quantity in both public and private blood banks.\n\nAlso Read: Climate Change Pushes Dengue Into New Frontiers Across India\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nNDTV - Dettol have been working towards a clean and healthy India since 2014 via the Banega Swachh India initiative, which in its Season 10 is helmed by Campaign Ambassador Ayushmann Khurrana. The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment, and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health, One Planet, One Future - Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone's health in India - especially vulnerable communities - the LGBTQ population, indigenous people, India's different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In a world post COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition, mental well-being, self-care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival - climate change. It has now been described as a \"code red for humanity.\" The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution, waste management, plastic ban, manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene. Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat, the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.", "source": {"uri":

Many patients might show negative dengue results but may still need close monitoring,\" Gurgaon chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said. He stressed that dengue can progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever, which can ultimately lead to haemorrhage, organ failure, and potentially death.\n\n\"Although early symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, and joint pain may appear manageable, they can swiftly worsen without adequate medical supervision,\" he added.\n\n\"We're observing a significant increase in various viral and bacterial infections, which can mimic dengue symptoms. It's crucial to understand that, The NS1 antigen test, which detects the dengue virus directly, is most effective within the first 5 days of illness. The IgM antibody test, which identifies the body's immune response to the virus, typically becomes reliable from Day 5 onwards. False negatives are a real concern. A patient may test negative for dengue initially but develop symptoms later, or may have another infection entirely.

It is common in tropical and subtropical regions. Most people infected with dengue won't show symptoms, but if they do, they might experience high fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and a rash. Fortunately, most recover within one to two weeks. Dengue fever is on the rise and, as we reported earlier this week, Orange Walk, Cayo and Toledo districts recorded over three hundred cases since the beginning of the season. News Five's Isani Cayetano reports.\n\nRecognized by white markings on its legs, the Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that can spread a number of viruses and other disease agents. These illnesses include dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. The vector comes from Africa, but is now present in various tropical, subtropical and temperate regions across the world.\n\n\"That is the variety of the mosquito that, and the females, for the eggs, they need the blood and then they deposit the eggs and then in these good climate conditions, especially flooding.\"\n\nIt's dengue season and the swarms of mosquitoes that come alive at sunset are voracious. Males thrive on fruit, while their female counterparts are bloodsuckers. They need it to mature their eggs. These small biting flies are attracted to chemical substances produced by mammals, including ammonia and carbon dioxide. Hosts include horses and humans.\n\n\"The mosquitoes have developed abilities to become more resistant as with everything else. The mosquitoes create especially the virus because dengue is a virus disease with the mosquitoes ability to survive in urban and suburban regions and the perfect conditions. What are the perfect conditions? Right now, it's rainy season, it's hurricane season. We have flooding and we have water contained in different areas that are essentially the perfect space for the mosquito, for their eggs to hatch and we have more.\"\n\nDengue fever is frequently asymptomatic; if symptoms appear they typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. In mild cases, treatment is focused on treating pain symptoms. Severe cases of dengue require hospitalization.\n\nKim Bautista, Chief of Vector Control Operations\n\n\"As a country, we have reported eight hundred and sixty-five dengue cases, three hundred and eighty-three lab-confirmed cases, and four hundred and eighty-two clinical confirmed cases. Seventy-five percent of those cases come from the Orange Walk, Cayo and Toledo districts. The Toledo District, majority of their cases are from Punta Gorda Town and, of course, Bella Vista.\"\n\nBack in March, the Pan American Health Organization warned of an increase in dengue cases in the Americas. At the time, over three point five million cases and more than one thousand deaths had been reported in the region.\n\n\"In 2019, a record was set for the highest incidents of dengue in the region. At that time, the region saw three point one-eight million dengue cases. That record was broken in 2023 where the region saw four point five million cases. We're at week twenty-seven, but the most recent report from PAHO shows that at week twenty-four of this year, there has been a reported ten point one million cases. So you could see where, in the past five years, the region has seen three records set for the highest incidents of dengue ever.\"\n\nSeveral environmental and social factors contribute to the spread of dengue, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the El Nino phenomenon. Rapid population growth and unplanned urbanization also play a crucial role, including poor housing conditions and inadequate water and sanitation services create mosquito breeding sites through discarded objects that can collect water.\n\n\"Most of the time, the classic signs of dengue is the patients, after they are bitten by the mosquito, we have an incubation period that can vary between three to fourteen days and an average of seven days. In that moment then the patient starts to develop initially fever and this fever can last up to five days. This fever with associated symptoms, most commonly the patients are going to complain about having pain behind the eyes, muscle ache or, in some other areas, we call it breaking bone fever because it's a lot of pain in the muscles and also it's like arthritis type of pain.\"\n\nPAHO Director Jarbas Barbosa calls for action, advising strongly for heightened efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites and protect against mosquito bites. There is also a need for increased readiness in health services for early diagnosis and timely clinical management, and continuous work to educate the population about dengue symptoms and when to seek prompt medication.

These findings highlight the potential impact of dengue infection on mental health and underscore the importance of further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these associations,\" the authors wrote in the study. \"Proposed mechanisms suggested that brain inflammation can alter serotonin neurotransmitter levels, potentially leading to the development of mood disorders.\"\n\n\"Reports from Sri Lanka and India have highlighted dengue patients had higher depressive scores, anxiety scores, and stress scores than controls and about 15% prevalence of depression in the dengue group during a 6 to 24-month follow-up after dengue infection; the anxiety and depressive symptoms correlated with the dengue infection severity,\" the authors added. \"In addition, long-term follow-up studies indicate that certain individuals may experience enduring symptoms, including headache, skin rash, and chronic fatigue, well beyond the acute phase of dengue infection.\"\n\nLead author Hsin-I Shih and team at the National Cheng Kung University and National Health Research Institutes in Taiwan analyzed the medical records of 45,334 patients who were diagnosed with dengue from 2002 to 2015. The team compared those patients's mental health status after recovering with 226,670 people who had never been infected by the dengue virus.\n\nThey observed that the dengue patients were far more likely to develop depressive disorders more than 12 months post-infection. \"Moreover, there was a mild elevation in the risk of sleep disorders within three to twelve months after a dengue infection, while no heightened risk of anxiety disorders was reported during the study period,\" the authors noted. \"Dengue virus-induced encephalopathy, occurring during the acute phase of the disease, may present as decreased sensitivity, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, and personality disorders, including sudden mania, depression, anxiety, psychosis, and agoraphobia.\"\n\n\"The neurotoxic inflammation induced by cytokines has been found to decrease tryptophan levels, the amino acid precursor for serotonin, which positively correlates with the severity of depressive symptoms in patients,\" they explained.\n\nAnother reason why mental health issues could manifest after a severe viral infection like dengue is that patients tend to experience unexpected life disruptions, particularly if they are hospitalized. \"Hospitalization, inherently, can profoundly disrupt one's daily routines. Amidst such upheavals, individuals confront exceptional stresses and might succumb to debilitating psychological issues like depression, anxiety, and insomnia,\" the authors added. \"Within Taiwan's universal healthcare system, dengue patients receive comprehensive care designed to manage their condition throughout and after the infection, often at minimal cost. However, despite the high standard of care provided, these individuals may still encounter significant psychological stress, potentially leading to an elevated risk of developing mental health disorders subsequent to their infection.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mood disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dengue virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglected_tropical_diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neglected tropical diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurotransmitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serotonin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Encephalitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sleep disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_stress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological stress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_System_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive System Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6688395bf353ad305c1e6aac/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723200", "eventUri": "eng-9723200", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Health (M.O.H.) has yet again emphasised the practice of preventative measures following 10 new lab-confirmed dengue cases, according to reports from the Samoa Observer.\n\nThe declaration of the new confirmed cases was published in its most recent surveillance report issue No. 18 from June 24-30.\n\nAccording to the release, the majority of cases involved people between the ages of 20 and 29, and given that the trend indicates a decrease, it was strongly encouraged to keep practicing preventative measures.\n\nSince November of last year, a total of 456 lab-confirmed dengue cases have been recorded and there have been no dengue related deaths so far.\n\nThe Ministry of Health stressed that there was no significant improvement in the growing number of dengue-like cases nationwide despite the national clean-up campaign, and they cautioned the public to comply with proactive precautions.\n\nHealthcare professionals have emphasised the significance of taking preventative action to stop the infection from spreading, such as removing stagnant water sources from residential areas to prevent mosquito breeding grounds.\n\nTo reduce the chance of mosquito bites, people are also urged to use safeguards such as repellants, mosquito nets, and proper clothes.\n\nRead more at The Observer\n\nThese findings could potentially lessen the effect of future outbreaks by strengthening early warning systems and improving outbreak response tactics.\n\nA recent study on climate indicators and global dengue incidence spanning from 1990 to 2019 has shed light on critical associations.\n\nResearchers identified the Indian Ocean basin-wide (IOBW) index as a significant indicator closely linked to dengue epidemics in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nAccording to the study published in the journal Science, the IOBW index serves as a reliable predictor of dengue incidence due to its influence on local temperature anomalies through teleconnections.\n\nThese findings hold promise in bolstering early warning systems and enhancing outbreak response strategies, potentially mitigating the impact of future outbreaks.\n\nAdditionally, there are still significant discrepancies in what is known about the mechanisms driving dengue transmission that are driven by climate change, despite progress in this area.\n\nThe study emphasises the necessity for comprehensive strategies that take into account the various environmental factors seen in different places in order to accurately predict and contain dengue outbreaks around the globe.\n\nMeanwhile, the North West of Upolu (NWU) and Apia Urban Area (AUA) regions have a high concentration of dengue cases.", "source": {"uri": "samoanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Samoa

Some cases can progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever, which can be life-threatening, especially upon repeat infection with different virus types (serotypes) such as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4.\n\nIn 2023, Bangladesh faced its most severe dengue outbreak in two decades, resulting in 1,705 deaths -- making it the deadliest globally that year. A recent icddr,b study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene indicates that the outbreak could be primarily driven by the resurgence of the DENV-2 strain, responsible for about 74% of cases. Tests on blood samples from dengue patients confirmed DENV-2 as the predominant strain, followed by DENV-1 (20%) and DENV-3 (6%). Notably, DENV-1 is found to be more prevalent in rural areas like Cox's Bazar.\n\nSeveral factors exacerbated the outbreak, including high urban population density, climate change impacts more specifically intermittent rainfall, rapid urbanisation without adequate planning, insufficient mosquito control measures, and increased travel.\n\nBangladesh reported a staggering 321,179 hospitalised dengue cases in 2023 -- significantly higher than previous years, causing widespread concern. The actual number of cases could be much higher.\n\nHistorically, different dengue strains have caused outbreaks at different times. From 2000 to 2002, DENV-3 led to numerous hospitalisations, while DENV-2 dominated from 2013 to 2018, followed by a resurgence of DENV-3 from 2019 to 2022. In 2023, DENV-2 once again caused the highest number of cases and fatalities.\n\nDiscussing the implications of the findings, Dr Mohammad Shafiul Alam, Scientist in the Programme for Enteric Infections and Vaccines, Infectious Diseases Division at icddr,b and Senior Author of the article, indicated that historical data shows when a particular dengue strain emerges or re-emerges, it tends to remain dominant for the next few years. Reinfection with the same strain is less likely. The resurgence of DENV-2 in 2023 suggests that the prevalence of dengue in Dhaka, where most of the cases were reported, may decrease in the coming years; however, we must remain vigilant. However, reinfection with a different serotype can be severe, making individual-level prevention and Aedes aegypti mosquito control critical priorities.\n\nThe study, conducted between July and December 2023, analysed 354 blood samples collected from patients aged between 5 and 65 years with clinical symptoms of dengue (e.g., onset of fever between 2 and 5 days and/or other symptoms, such as rash, myalgia, bone pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea). These samples were collected from Alikadam (Bandarban), Shyamnagar (Shatkhira), Ramu, Teknaf, and Ukhiya (Cox's Bazar), representing rural areas, and from the districts of Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, and Cox's Bazar, representing urban areas.\n\nThis shift in predominant dengue strains underscores the critical need for effective mosquito control strategies and the development of a universal dengue vaccine capable of combating all serotypes.", "source": {"uri": "reliefweb.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReliefWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The internal data analysis highlights a significant increase in dengue testing, raising concerns about the spread of this mosquito-borne disease during the monsoon season. Examining recent data from the user base, MediBuddy found that out of all dengue tests conducted across cities, a staggering 71% of requests originated from Bengaluru alone, while Hyderabad accounted for 14%. Other cities also showed noteworthy percentages of dengue test requests: Pune at 4%, Kolkata, Mumbai, Marunji, and Noida each at 2%, and Thane, Nagpur, and Delhi each at 1%.\n\nThe rising trend in dengue tests coincides with the monsoon season, a period known for increased mosquito breeding. This correlation emphasises the need for heightened vigilance and preventive measures among the public. The concentration of test requests in just two cities highlighted the heightened risk and awareness of dengue in these urban areas.\n\nDr. Gowri Kulkarni, Head of Medical Operations, MediBuddy said, \"The sharp rise in dengue test requests, especially in urban centers like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, is a clear indicator of the growing health concern. It's imperative that residents in these areas remain extra vigilant, and that local health authorities ramp up mosquito control efforts and public awareness campaigns. Early detection and timely medical intervention are key to managing dengue effectively.\"\n\nThe analysis uncovered significant variations in test request patterns across cities. Bangalore experienced a notable surge during the third week of June, with test requests increasing by 150% compared to the second week of May , coinciding with the start of the monsoon season. Hyderabad followed a similar trend, peaking in the fourth week of June with a 50% increase in test requests from its initial phase. These temporal patterns offer valuable insights for healthcare providers and local authorities, enabling more effective resource allocation and targeted preventive measures.\n\nEarly symptoms of dengue include sudden high fever (up to 104\u00b0F), acute headaches, and severe pain behind the eyes.

On Wednesday, the survey was conducted in Bhanwarkuan and Vishnupuri areas, uncovering numerous mosquito breeding sites. District Malaria Officer Dr Daulat Patel reported that open tanks, tyres and other sources of stagnant water conducive to larva generation were identified at 198 locations.\n\nIn response to these findings, health department teams will urge residents to cover tanks and eliminate stagnant water. Following this, drones will be deployed to spray chemicals to eradicate larvae at these sites. 'Drones will be used to prevent the rapidly increasing dengue infection in the city and eliminate dengue mosquitoes,' Dr Patel stated.\n\nCurrently, the number of dengue patients in Indore has reached 113 and no new case was found on Wednesday. To address this, high-tech drones have been provided to the health department for the first time, marking a significant step in dengue control efforts. Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) Dr BS Saitya explained that drones will help identify mosquito hotspots throughout the state.\n\n'With the help of drones, areas for mosquitoes breeding will be defined. There are large buildings, open water tanks, tyres and many other places where larvae can develop due to rainwater, which are inaccessible to our staff. In such situations, using high-tech drones to spray larva-killing chemicals will help eliminate the larvae,' Dr Saitya said.\n\nThe rainy season has exacerbated mosquito infestation in the city, leading to a surge in patients suffering from diseases like malaria and dengue. Dr Saitya mentioned that currently, drones are deployed only in Indore, but if a reduction in dengue cases is observed, the number of drones may be increased. The arrival of these high-tech drones has been met with enthusiasm by district health department employees and officers, as it significantly reduces manual effort required to destroy dengue larvae.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stagnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water stagnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Larva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wet season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-07/7380a23b-3099-499e-9b53-3d65dde08d78/drone 1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723200", "eventUri": "eng-9723200", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Spread by the Aedes mosquito, particularly Aedes aegypti, it is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nSymptoms range from mild fever to incapacitating high fever, with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash.\n\nDespite the rising numbers, the province remains below both the epidemic and alert thresholds. Current data shows that for the 27th morbidity week of June 29 to July 6, the province recorded 245 cases, significantly below the alert threshold of 862 cases.\n\nThe epidemic threshold, set at 1,415 cases for the same period, saw only 128 cases reporting signs and symptoms within that week.\n\nLabis emphasized that while the province is far from a dengue outbreak, the anticipated rise in July and August necessitates stronger preventive measures and early detection strategies to manage the anticipated surge and prevent fatalities.\n\nThe focus is on averting an increase in deaths during these months, which can be achieved by enhancing early detection of dengue cases in the community and ensuring timely referral to appropriate health facilities, he said.\n\nAt the municipal level, the gravity of the situation is more palpable with Badiangan, Lemery, and Passi City reaching the alert threshold for dengue cases. In response, IPHO is concentrating on municipalities with high dengue cases to provide timely intervention and assistance, including medicines, IV fluids, and manpower.\n\nPublic behavior plays a significant role in managing dengue cases, Dr. Labis noted. A noticeable trend is the public's complacency during dips in case numbers, followed by reactive measures when cases rise. This cyclical behavior is what IPHO aims to change by advocating for year-round vigilance, particularly practicing the 4S strategy against dengue: search and destroy breeding places; self-protection measures; seek early treatment; and say yes to fogging during outbreaks.\n\nGov. Arthur Defensor Jr. has previously issued an executive order mandating all 43 municipalities and Passi City to conduct the \"4 o'clock habit\", a routine cleanup activity aimed at eliminating potential breeding grounds.\n\nFrom January 1 to July 6 of this year, the province registered 1,708 dengue cases with five fatalities, marking a 106 percent increase from the same period in 2023, which recorded only 829 cases. The municipalities with the highest incidences include Lambunao, with 121 cases and one death, followed by Passi City (97), Badiangan (87 cases with two death), Calinog (81), Oton (74), Miag-ao (59 cases with two deaths), Lemery (56), Dumangas (55), Janiuay (53), and Dingle (54).\n\nMoreover, a clustering of cases was noted in 46 barangays across 23 municipalities, indicating localized outbreaks.\n\nClustering means three or more dengue cases in four consecutive reporting week period.\n\n* Ajuy - Poblacion (four), Progreso (three), and San Antonio (three)\n\n* Anilao - Mostro

The concentration of test requests in just two cities highlighted the heightened risk and awareness of dengue in these urban areas, it stated.\n\nDr. Gowri Kulkarni, Head of Medical Operations, MediBuddy said, \"The sharp rise in dengue test requests, especially in urban centers like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, is a clear indicator of the growing health concern. It's imperative that residents in these areas remain extra vigilant, and that local health authorities ramp up mosquito control efforts and public awareness campaigns. Early detection and timely medical intervention are key to managing dengue effectively.\"\n\nThe analysis uncovered significant variations in test request patterns across cities, it said Bangalore experienced a notable surge during the third week of June, with test requests increasing by 150 per cent compared to the second week of May , coinciding with the start of the monsoon season.\n\nA similar trend in Hyderabad , peaking in the fourth week of June with a 50 per cent increase in test requests from its initial phase. These temporal patterns offer valuable insights for healthcare providers and local authorities, enabling more effective resource allocation and targeted preventive measures.\n\nEarly symptoms of dengue include sudden high fever (up to 104\u00b0F), acute headaches, and severe pain behind the eyes. It is advised to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur, especially after being in a dengue-prone area. If the condition persists beyond 72 hours, seek medical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests, it added.\n\nUNI KNR SY", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_News_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United News of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nagpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.uniindia.com/cms/gall_content/2024/7/2024_7$largeimg11_Jul_2024_135642250.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723200", "eventUri": "eng-9723200", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

A District Task Force for Dengue, led by the Deputy Commissioner, has to be formed in each district. This task force will include officials from various departments, medical professionals, and NGOs, and will review dengue control measures weekly to suggest necessary containment steps.\n\nOne of the vital directives is to cover all houses for source reduction every fortnight through ASHA and health staff, supplemented by volunteers in urban areas. A public campaign for source reduction will be conducted every Friday or on another designated day, involving elected representatives, citizens, and other departments to promote cleanliness and proper water storage practices.\n\nThe circular emphasizes the identification of dengue hotspots -- an area with a radius of about 100 meters where two or more dengue cases have been reported. Detailed information about these hotspots has to be shared with the state war room.\n\nOfficials are instructed to monitor every dengue-positive case daily for 14 days from the onset of symptoms and update the state war room on their medical condition. Positive cases will be educated about the early warning signs of the disease progressing to moderate or severe stages.\n\nThis activity shall be done for all dengue-positive cases even if these are outside the hotspot areas.\n\nA minimum of five beds should be reserved in Taluk Hospitals and 8-10 beds in District Hospitals for dengue cases, which can be used for other patients if not fully utilized by dengue patients. All testing and treatment facilities, including ICU care if necessary, will be provided free of cost to all dengue patients, regardless of their BPL/APL status in all healthcare facilities that are under the Department of Health and Family Welfare.\n\nHealthcare facilities are instructed to maintain a sufficient stock of testing kits, essential drugs, and IV fluids. Additionally, Platelets, Fresh Frozen Plasma, and other blood components must be available in both public and private blood banks, with stock levels regularly updated on e-Rakt Kosh.\n\nThe Dengue fever update on Thursday stated that 381 new cases were reported in Karnataka in the past 24 hours.

Over the last few weeks, there has been a significant increase in dengue cases, with some patients requiring hospital admission and specialised care. Thus, it is crucial to recognise early symptoms and take precautions.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nDengue fever, caused by the dengue virus, is spread by the vector Aedes Aegypti mosquito. It usually appears in three phases: the febrile phase, the critical phase, and the recovery phase. Patients develop symptoms within 8-12 days after the mosquito bite, which is during the febrile phase. These include high-grade fever, severe myalgia, backache, headache, and rash. These symptoms are common among both children and adults and may last for three to five days.\n\nChildren may additionally have abdominal pain, vomiting, nosebleeds, and gum bleeding.

Hospitals and nursing homes are witnessing a steady influx of patients, highlighting the urgency of the situation. Several suspected cases of Dengue are on the rise.\n\nRecent reports from the health department reveal that ten dengue cases have been confirmed at the sole vector test lab of Kolhan, located in MGM Medical College, Dimna. The affected patients, whose samples were sent from Tata Main Hospital (Bistupur) and Mercy Hospital (Baridih), underscore the widespread nature of the outbreak.\n\nThe rise in dengue and viral fever cases, particularly in the fringe areas of Jamshedpur, has been alarming over the past week. The heavy concentration of vectors in these regions has been identified as a primary factor. Local doctors attribute the surge in cases to deteriorating hygiene conditions in the city, warning that if civic bodies fail to take immediate action, the situation could escalate uncontrollably.\n\nIn response to this health crisis, District Magistrate cum Deputy Commissioner Ananya Mittal has issued stringent directives for large-scale fogging, anti-larvae treatment, and the spraying of bleaching powder across urban areas. The Municipal Corporation, following these instructions, has commenced these preventive measures on a war footing. Efforts are being concentrated on waterlogged areas, known breeding grounds for mosquitoes, where anti-larvae chemicals and fogging are being deployed intensively.\n\nTo combat the potential dengue threat, personnel have been assigned to spray larvicide and other anti-mosquito chemicals in every ward, particularly targeting waterlogged and contaminated sites. These workers have been equipped with spray machines and necessary chemicals to ensure effective coverage.\n\nThe health department, too, is on high alert. Preparations have been completed at various levels to handle the situation, ensuring a coordinated response to the threat. This proactive approach by the district administration and health department aims to curb the spread of dengue and mitigate the impact on public health.\n\nHowever, the fight against dengue requires the collective effort of the community. Residents are urged to maintain cleanliness in their surroundings, avoid water stagnation, and use mosquito repellents to protect themselves from bites. Public awareness campaigns are essential to educate citizens about preventive measures and the importance of seeking timely medical attention if symptoms arise.\n\nAs Jamshedpur braces for the continued onslaught of dengue and viral fever, the concerted actions of the administration, health department, and community members will be crucial in overcoming this public health challenge.", "source": {"uri": "avenuemail.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Avenue Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshedpur", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamshedpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jamshedpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolhan_division", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolhan division"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistupur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bistupur"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tata Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_hypochlorite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calcium hypochlorite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipal corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(electoral_subdivision)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ward (electoral subdivision)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larvicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larvicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stagnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water stagnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_repellent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insect repellent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://avenuemail.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dengue.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723200", "eventUri": "eng-9723200", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jamshedpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Thimmaiah has cautioned people with dengue against consuming paracetamol tablets without consulting a doctor.\n\nWhen a person is down with dengue the count of the white blood cells in the body declines. Consuming a painkiller tablet (paracetamol) in such a condition without the recommendation of the doctor is dangerous to one's health. It may lead to serious side effects or sometimes even death, he said.\n\nDr. Thimmaiah was speaking at an emergency meeting in the office of the Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner on Wednesday. The meeting was called in connection with creating awareness among people on precautions to be taken to prevent the spread of dengue.\n\nThe DHO said that many people have the habit of consuming paracetamol on their own to get rid of the fever. They should be cautious against doing so.\n\nHe said that some people drink juice made from the leaves of a papaya tree to get cured of dengue. This is also dangerous to the health. People should not resort to self medication, the DHO said.\n\nDistrict Vector-Borne Disease Control Officer Naveenchandra Kulal said that there is no medicine specifically prescribed to get rid of dengue, the spread of which can be controlled only by destroying breeding spots of dengue-causing mosquitoes, which breed in fresh water.\n\nDr. Kulal said that having severe fever, body and joint pain for more than three days, severe headache, eye pain, vomiting, and bleeding from the mouth and the nose are symptoms of dengue. He said that people should drink boiled water.\n\nAdditional Deputy Commissioner G. Santhosh Kumar asked taluk-level officials to identify breeding spots and destroy the larvae within two days. Mr. Kumar asked officials to create awareness on the spread of dengue in schools and colleges. If possible, children should be asked to wear full-sleeve clothes to protect themselves from mosquitoes, he added.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paracetamol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_(pharmacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet (pharmacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkin_Thimmaiah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikkin Thimmaiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshina_Kannada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dakshina Kannada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dakshina Kannada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White blood cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analgesic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Papaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthralgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/1dk2hz/article68393087.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/10505_29-7-2019_21-27-50_2_IMG-20190729-WA0052.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723200", "eventUri": "eng-9723200", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The Home Secretary spoke after Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett was among the 22 killed in the 2017 blast at the Ariana Grande concert and has been campaigning to get the law passed, said she felt \u201cmisled\u201d by Rishi Sunak this week. Ms Murray said she felt \u201clet down\u201d after the Prime Minister told her on Wednesday, just hours before he called the election, that he would introduce the legislation before the parliamentary summer break. Martyn\u2019s Law would require venues and local authorities in the UK to have training requirements and preventative plans against terror attacks. Asked whether the Government would apologise to Ms Murray, Mr Cleverly told Sky News\u2019s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme: \u201cOf course we\u2019re sorry that not all the legislation has passed, and I\u2019m particularly sorry that we weren\u2019t able to get Martyn\u2019s Law on the statute books before the General Election. \u201cBut when I discussed with the family and the campaign group that it might straddle a General Election, that if we re-entered government we would prioritise this to get it on because it has taken longer than we would have wanted. \u201cAnd I said there is cross-party support, and I said I cannot envisage a world where this is not enacted, even if it is delayed because of a General Election.\u201d Ms Murray met Mr Sunak for closed-doors talks about the legislation on Wednesday, the seventh anniversary of her son\u2019s death, after completing a 200-mile walk to Downing Street as part of her campaign. Speaking to Adam Boulton on Times Radio on Sunday, she said the Prime Minister had \u201chesitated\u201d before shaking hands with her at their meeting as he promised to introduce the law change before summer. With Parliament prorogued and campaigning for the July 4 General Election under way, Ms Murray said she felt \u201cmisled\u201d and that the election announcement put everything they had discussed \u201cinto question\u201d. She said: \u201cSo the meeting was an interesting one because the Prime Minister promised me that he will bring Martyn\u2019s Law \u2013 introduce it into Parliament before summer recess \u2013 and I actually repeated \u2018you promise?\u2019 and he said, \u2018yes, I promise\u2019, so I actually reached my hand out and said, \u2018can we shake on this?\u2019 and there was this split second of hesitation, which I found a bit puzzling. \u201cIt was only a very short moment, but I was a bit confused about that sort of hesitation.\u201d She continued: \u201cI don\u2019t feel he lied to me. I feel he misled me. \u201cHe could have maybe worded it slightly different so that I would have left the meeting a little disappointed, but not misled.\u201d Mr Sunak said on Friday he had not deceived Ms Murray because he could still honour the commitment, telling journalists accompanying him on his whistlestop two-day tour of the four nations: \u201cI said by summer recess and that will still be possible. \u201cThe election is in the first week of July. Parliament will reconvene immediately after that, so there will still be time to bring that law in before summer recess, and that\u2019s what I remain committed to doing.\u201d Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer avoided making a guarantee that his party would bring it to Parliament ahead of the summer recess, but said he would introduce the law \u201cas a priority\u201d should he replace Mr Sunak in Number 10. Ms Murray told Times Radio she does not want an apology from the Prime Minister, but hopes the party that wins the election sticks to the pledges on passing the legislation.", "summary": "The Home Secretary apologised to the mother of a Manchester Arena attack victim for the legislation not being passed before the election.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-james-cleverly-home-secretary-martyns-law-law-b1160303.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/26/11/467501f41cbd1e6de47bdf724b1f583cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE2ODA0MjQx-2.76290675.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:18:35", "author": "Rosie Shead", "authors": ["Rosie Shead"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.176}

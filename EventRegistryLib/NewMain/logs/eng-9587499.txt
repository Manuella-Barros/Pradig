Gavin Newsom subsequently asked the full parole board to review the parole grant for Lazarus, who is now 64 and serving a 27-year-to-life state prison sentence. The board is expected to issue a ruling Tuesday.\n\nAt a hearing last Nov. 16, Lazarus publicly admitted that she had killed the 29-year-old Glendale Adventist Medical Center nursing supervisor.\n\nRasmussen was shot three times in the Balboa Boulevard condominium she shared with her husband. Rasmussen had married Ruetten, Lazarus' one-time love interest, three months before her death.\n\n\"It makes me sick to this day that I took an oath to protect and serve people, and I took Sherri Rasmussen's life from her, a nurse,\" Lazarus said, according to a transcript of the parole hearing last November. \"All I could think about was getting out of there before the police showed up.\"\n\nShe said she subsequently threw the gun into a bushy area off the freeway and reported her gun stolen to the Santa Monica Police Department, according to the transcript.\n\nLazarus did not appear before the parole board at its hearing Monday.\n\nBut a transcript from her parole hearing last November quotes her as saying, \"I never got comfortable thinking I got away with this. ... I didn't do the right thing because I didn't want to face the consequences of my actions. I didn't want to go to prison.\"\n\n\"... I will never, ever harm an individual like I did on February 24, 1986, when I murdered, callously murdered and heinously murdered Sherri Rasmussen,\" the transcript quotes Lazarus as saying at the parole hearing.\n\nTwo of the victim's sisters and two of her nieces joined Los Angeles police Det. Greg Stearns, former prosecutor Paul Nunez, two of the victim's friends and an attorney representing the victim's family Monday in opposing the parole grant.\n\nThe victim's sister, Connie, said she didn't believe that Lazarus met the intent of the state's youthful offender statute under which she is now eligible for parole, saying that Lazarus had a college degree from UCLA and had undergone an extensive psychological examination at the police academy.\n\nStearns told the parole board that Lazarus \"stalked\" her victim, chose a time and place where she would be alone, shot her to death, staged a burglary and made a false report to explain the absence of her gun.\n\n\"Those are not the hallmarks of a youthful offender. Those are the hallmarks of criminal sophistication,\" the detective said, urging the board to consider a letter sent by the Los Angeles Police Department \"in opposition.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Lazarus' supporters, who have dealt with her since she's been in prison, told the parole board that they believed she is remorseful and that her release on parole should go forward.\n\nOne called her a \"healed and transformed person\" who has \"worked tirelessly to improve herself,\" and another called her a \"community builder\" and cited her \"warmth, friendliness and outgoing nature.\"\n\nA former state prison inmate said that Lazarus has been a \"personal mentor\" to her, saying that she enrolled in and graduated from college because of Lazarus, whom she said should be allowed to \"reintegrate back into society.\"\n\nLazarus retired from the LAPD after being arrested by Robbery-Homicide Division detectives at the department's downtown headquarters, largely as a result of DNA evidence taken from a bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm.\n\nLAPD detectives had trailed Lazarus to surreptitiously get a DNA sample from her in May 2009 by collecting a drink cup and straw she had thrown in a trash can outside a Costco store.\n\nRasmussen's father, Nels, had insisted shortly after his daughter's killing that police investigate Lazarus, who had been an officer for two years at the time of Rasmussen's death. But the case went cold until 2004, when investigators with the LAPD's Cold Case Unit reopened the case and asked the coroner's office to locate the bite mark tissue sample, which had been stored in a freezer in an evidence room since 1986, according to a 2015 ruling by a three-justice panel from California's 2nd District Court of Appeal that upheld Lazarus' conviction.\n\nDNA testing determined that the major profile was from a female, and investigators turned their attention toward specific women who might have had reason to harm Rasmussen, according to the ruling.\n\nThe appellate court panel noted in its ruling that Lazarus' DNA profile \"precisely matched the profile of the person who bit Rasmussen shortly before her death.\"\n\nLazarus had a \"compelling motive to kill Rasmussen\" because she had been abruptly dropped by Ruetten when he met his future wife, and Lazarus had confronted Rasmussen at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where the 29-year- old woman worked as a nursing supervisor, the justices noted in the 2015 ruling.\n\nRuetten and Rasmussen were married in November 1985, a few months after Lazarus wrote Ruetten's mother that she was \"truly in love with John,\" the appellate court panel noted.\n\n\"The evidence of motive and the circumstantial evidence, combined with the presence of appellant's DNA on a wound inflicted on the victim during her struggles with her assailant, provided convincing evidence of appellant's guilt,\" Associate Justice Nora Manella wrote on behalf of the panel in its 2015 ruling.\n\nThe California Supreme Court refused in October 2015 to review the case against Lazarus.\n\nAfter the verdict, then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called the case \"a tragedy on every level\" and apologized for how long it took to \"solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe decision came one day after the victim's family members objected to a parole board panel's earlier recommendation of parole for Stephanie Ilene Lazarus, who confessed at a parole hearing in November that she had murdered her ex-lover's new wife, Sherri Rasmussen.\n\nA hearing is expected to be scheduled within four months, and a panel will review new information to determine whether there is good cause to rescind the parole grant for Lazarus or whether the prior hearing panel made a fundamental error and improperly granted parole, according to Mary Xjimenez of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nAt Monday's hearing in Sacramento, Rasmussen's widower, John Ruetten, told the parole board that Lazarus -- whom he referred to as \"the inmate\" -- \"lied for decades until her only option was to pursue parole.\"\n\nSpeaking to the board remotely, Ruetten said his slain wife's parents lost a child and her sisters lost a dear friend and confidante \"because Sherri loved and married me.\"\n\n\"For me, this reality and pain never subside,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"I respectfully request you revoke her grant for parole.\"\n\nA state parole board panel recommended parole Nov. 16 for Lazarus, an art theft investigator and 25-year LAPD veteran who was convicted in March 2012 of first-degree murder for the Feb. 24, 1986, killing of Sherri Rasmussen.\n\nAt that hearing last November, Lazarus publicly admitted that she had killed the 29-year-old Glendale Adventist Medical Center nursing supervisor.\n\nRasmussen was shot three times in the Balboa Boulevard condominium she shared with her husband. Rasmussen had married Ruetten, Lazarus' one-time love interest, three months before her death.\n\n\"It makes me sick to this day that I took an oath to protect and serve people, and I took Sherri Rasmussen's life from her, a nurse,\" Lazarus said, according to a transcript of the November parole hearing. \"All I could think about was getting out of there before the police showed up.\"\n\nShe said she subsequently threw the gun into a bushy area off the freeway and reported her gun stolen to the Santa Monica Police Department, according to the transcript.\n\nLazarus did not appear before the parole board at its hearing Monday.\n\nBut the transcript from her parole hearing last November quotes her as saying, \"I never got comfortable thinking I got away with this. ... I didn't do the right thing because I didn't want to face the consequences of my actions. I didn't want to go to prison.\"\n\n\"... I will never, ever harm an individual like I did on February 24, 1986, when I murdered, callously murdered and heinously murdered Sherri Rasmussen,\" the transcript quotes Lazarus as saying.\n\nNewsom subsequently asked the full parole board to review the parole grant for Lazarus, who is now 64 and serving a 27-year-to-life state prison sentence.\n\nIn his April 4 request to the state parole board, the governor wrote, \"I commend her for her efforts in rehabilitation and encourage her to continue on this positive path. However, I find that this case warrants the consideration of the full Board of Parole Hearings to determine whether Ms. Lazarus can be safely released at this time. ... I ask the full board to determine whether her rehabilitative progress is sufficient to support her safe release.\"\n\nThe governor noted that she had \"evaded justice for more than two decades and did not appear to begin taking full accountability for the murder until she was finally caught,\" while noting that she \"has desisted from violent conduct\" since the crime and \"participated in and internalized targeted rehabilitative programming, signs that she has made progress in mitigating her risk factors.\"\n\nAt the hearing Monday, two of the victim's sisters and two of her nieces joined Los Angeles police Detective Greg Stearns, former prosecutor Paul Nunez, two of the victim's friends and an attorney representing the victim's family in opposing the parole grant.\n\nThe victim's sister, Connie, said she didn't believe that Lazarus met the intent of the state's youthful offender statute under which she is now eligible for parole, saying that Lazarus had a college degree from UCLA and had undergone an extensive psychological examination at the police academy.\n\nStearns told the parole board that Lazarus \"stalked\" her victim, chose a time and place where she would be alone, shot her to death, staged a burglary and made a false report to explain the absence of her gun.\n\n\"Those are not the hallmarks of a youthful offender. Those are the hallmarks of criminal sophistication,\" the detective said, urging the board to consider a letter sent by the Los Angeles Police Department \"in opposition\" to Lazarus' parole grant.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Lazarus' supporters, who have dealt with her since she's been in prison, told the parole board they believed she is remorseful and that her release on parole should go forward.\n\nOne called her a \"healed and transformed person\" who has \"worked tirelessly to improve herself,\" and another called her a \"community builder\" and cited her \"warmth, friendliness and outgoing nature.\"\n\nA former state prison inmate said Lazarus has been a \"personal mentor\" to her, saying that she enrolled in and graduated from college because of Lazarus, whom she said should be allowed to \"reintegrate back into society.\"\n\nLazarus retired from the LAPD after being arrested by Robbery-Homicide Division detectives at the department's downtown headquarters, largely as a result of DNA evidence taken from a bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm.\n\nLAPD detectives had trailed Lazarus to surreptitiously get a DNA sample from her in May 2009 by collecting a drink cup and straw she had thrown in a trash can outside a Costco store.\n\nRasmussen's father, Nels, had insisted shortly after his daughter's killing that police investigate Lazarus, who had been an officer for two years at the time of Rasmussen's death. But the case went cold until 2004, when investigators with the LAPD's Cold Case Unit reopened the case and asked the coroner's office to locate the bite mark tissue sample, which had been stored in a freezer in an evidence room since 1986, according to a 2015 ruling by a three-justice panel from California's 2nd District Court of Appeal that upheld Lazarus' conviction.\n\nDNA testing determined that the major profile was from a female, and investigators turned their attention toward specific women who might have had reason to harm Rasmussen, according to the ruling.\n\nThe appellate court panel noted in its ruling that Lazarus' DNA profile \"precisely matched the profile of the person who bit Rasmussen shortly before her death.\"\n\nLazarus had a \"compelling motive to kill Rasmussen\" because she had been abruptly dropped by Ruetten when he met his future wife, and Lazarus had confronted Rasmussen at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where the 29-year-old woman worked as a nursing supervisor, the justices noted in the 2015 ruling.\n\nRuetten and Rasmussen were married in November 1985, a few months after Lazarus wrote Ruetten's mother that she was \"truly in love with John,\" the appellate court panel noted.\n\n\"The evidence of motive and the circumstantial evidence, combined with the presence of appellant's DNA on a wound inflicted on the victim during her struggles with her assailant, provided convincing evidence of appellant's guilt,\" Associate Justice Nora Manella wrote on behalf of the panel in its 2015 ruling.\n\nThe California Supreme Court refused in October 2015 to review the case against Lazarus.\n\nAfter the verdict, then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called the case \"a tragedy on every level\" and apologized for how long it took to \"solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy.\"", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Victim's family fought back", "body": "Despite a campaign by justice reform advocates, the California Board of Parole Hearings has revoked plans to release former LAPD Det. Stephanie Lazarus from prison after hearing emotional testimony from family and friends who said she \"lied for decades\" and used her police training to cover up the 1986 murder of her ex-boyfriend's wife.\n\nThe decision marks another chapter in a notorious murder case that rocked the Los Angeles Police Department. It overturns a November recommendation by a parole panel that the 64-year-old should be set free after serving 15 years of her life sentence and a new hearing be held to examine evidence in the case. The governor's office had asked the board in April to review the plan to parole Lazarus.\n\nA tear ran down John Ruetten's cheek Monday as he recalled the \"brutal murder\" of his wife, Sherri Rasmussen, by a jealous Lazarus, who finally confessed to the crime last year at a parole panel.\n\n\"We're not here today -- 38 years after Sherri's brutal murder, reliving the horror -- because of an impulsive act. [It was] skillful deception and complete disregard for the suffering of others. The inmate used her police training to cover up the crime,\" Ruetten told the parole board, which was considering releasing Lazarus as early as July.\n\n\"She lied for decades until her only option was to pursue parole,\" he added, noting Lazarus' denial of the crime at her arrest in 2009, during her trial three years later and through repeated appeals.\n\nLazarus was a detective with 25 years on the force when homicide investigators reopened Rasmussen's cold case and tested DNA from a bite mark on the victim. The 2009 examination led to Lazarus' arrest in the death of the 29-year-old nursing director.\n\nThree years later, Lazarus was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 27 years to life in prison at the California Institution for Women in Chino.\n\nOn Monday, Rasmussen's friends and family -- including two sisters and two nieces -- begged the parole board to keep Lazarus locked up, saying she is a cold, calculating killer working the system she knows everything about as a former cop.\n\nConnie Rasmussen said far from being a \"youthful offender\" -- as justice reform advocates have described Lazurus, who was 25 at the time of the slaying -- her sister's killer was an educated cop who graduated from UCLA and committed a \"well-planned and executed murder.\"\n\nIn contrast, justice reform advocates, formerly incarcerated persons and a wrongly convicted inmate told tales of Lazarus' prison leadership and work in education programs, religious advocacy, comforting dying inmates and even buying books for others.\n\n\"Stephanie is kind, compassionate and a dedicated individual. She has taken full responsibility for her actions,\" said Jane Dorotik of the Los Angeles Innocence Project, who served 12 years alongside Lazarus before her own murder conviction was overturned. \"I saw many women who talked a big talk about giving back to the community. Stephanie actually accomplished it.\"\n\nA nun, two college professors and several formerly incarcerated people called Lazarus a \"transformed person\" who \"worked tirelessly to improve herself\" and others. One former inmate described how Lazarus helped her turn her life around in prison as her \"personal mentor,\" enabling her to graduate from college.\n\nLazarus did not appear before the board Monday, but spoke to the panel in November.\n\n\"It makes me sick to this day that I took an oath to protect and serve people, and I took Sherri Rasmussen's life from her, a nurse,\" Lazarus said, according to a transcript of the hearing. \"All I could think about was getting out of there before the police showed up.\"\n\nRuetten, however, told parole commissioners on Monday the \"inmate\" -- as he called Lazarus -- is a master of deception.\n\n\"Sherri's parents lost her child, and her sisters lost a dear friend and confidante because Sherri loved and married me,\" he said, his voice quivering. \"For me, the reality of the pain never subsides.\"\n\nRuetten and Lazarus met as students at UCLA in the 1970s. Though the two dated casually for a few years after graduating, Ruetten testified at trial that he never considered Lazarus his girlfriend.\n\nHe later met Rasmussen, and they became engaged. Soon after, Ruetten said, he was confronted by Lazarus, then an LAPD patrol officer, who pleaded with him not to get married. Ruetten and Rasmussen wed in 1985.\n\nThe following year, Ruetten returned home from work to find Rasmussen badly beaten and with three gunshot wounds to the chest. The initial investigation determined Rasmussen died during a robbery by two men at the home, but no arrests were made.\n\nThe case was reopened in 2009, and DNA was run on a saliva sample taken as evidence from a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm. The sample was found to have come from a woman. Undercover officers collected Lazarus' DNA, and after a match was made against the bite-mark evidence, she was arrested.\n\nGreg Stearns, a veteran LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division detective who made the arrest, told the parole board on Monday that Lazarus does not deserve to be released.\n\n\"Stephanie Lazarus stalked her victim, chose a time and place when she knew she would have the victim alone. Brought cordage to bind her, used an improvised suppressor to execute her, staged a burglary and then disposed of the murder weapon and filed a false police report with an outside agency to explain the absence of that weapon,\" he told the panel. \"Those are not the hallmarks of youthful offense. They are the hallmarks of criminal sophistication and maturity.\"\n\nHe said if someone comes between something Lazarus desires, \"she is capable of that level of savagery and violence\" again.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_winton@latimes.com", "name": "Richard Winton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sherri_Rasmussen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder of Sherri Rasmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_of_Bethany", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lazarus of Bethany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parole board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institution_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Institution for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot_wound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunshot wound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d16d743/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1350+0+204/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2Fe0%2F8228b5b44c0da5be07c48647ce71%2Fdetective-killing.JPEG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587499", "eventUri": "eng-9587499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

The full board took up her case on Monday and later voted to order a rescission hearing, referring the case to a lower panel to consider whether to rescind the earlier recommendation.\n\nRasmussen's sisters and widower gave emotional testimony during Monday's hearing about their pain and described Lazarus as a conniving criminal who used her police training to cover up the killing.\n\nRuetten told the board he doesn't believe that Lazarus -- whom he referred to only as \"the inmate\" -- feels remorse.

No arrests of any suspected killers were ever made.\n\nOn Monday, some of Rasmussen's friends and family, including her two sisters, asked the parole board to keep the killer behind bars.\n\nLazarus, they said, was anything but a 'youthful offender' at the time - she was 25 at the time of the killing - and according to her detractors was a highly skilled member of the police force who used her knowledge to plan and execute the murder.\n\nJohn Ruetten, pictured at Lazarus' mid-2000s sentencing hearing, delivering a victim impact statement\n\nSherri Rasmussen was just 29-years-old and had only been married for four months when she was murdered in her marital condo\n\nParents of shooting victim, Sherri Rasmussen, Neil Rasmussen, and his wife Loretta appear at news conference after a court hearing for Los Angeles Police detective Stephanie Lazarus, Tuesday June 9, 2009 in Los Angeles\n\nThough criminal justice reform groups have advocated for the release of Lazarus, a parole board decided against it on Tuesday\n\nCriminal justice reform groups have long-been focused on Lazarus' case and have argued in favor of her freedom due in part to the leadership she has shown during her time in prison.\n\nJane Dorotik of LA's Innocence Project, called Lazarus 'kind, compassionate and a dedicated individual. She has taken full responsibility for her actions.'\n\nDorotik previously served a dozen years before having her conviction overturned.\n\nOthers told the board that they believe Lazarus is a 'transformed person.'\n\nLazarus herself did not make an appearance before the board on Monday, but spoke to the panel in November about the murder:\n\n'It makes me sick to this day that I took an oath to protect and serve people, and I took Sherri Rasmussen's life from her, a nurse. All I could think about was getting out of there before the police showed up.'\n\nThe LAPD detective who arrested Lazarus a decade-and-a-half ago, Gregg Stearns, spoke against her release.\n\n'Stephanie Lazarus stalked her victim, chose a time and place when she knew she would have the victim alone.

It overturns a November recommendation by a parole panel that the 64-year-old should be set free after serving 15 years of her life sentence and a new hearing be held to examine evidence in the case. The governor's office had asked the board in April to review the plan to parole Lazarus.\n\nA tear ran down John Ruetten's cheek Monday as he recalled the \"brutal murder\" of his wife, Sherri Rasmussen, by a jealous Lazarus, who finally confessed to the crime last year at a parole panel.\n\n\"We're not here today -- 38 years after Sherri's brutal murder, reliving the horror -- because of an impulsive act. [It was] skillful deception and complete disregard for the suffering of others. The inmate used her police training to cover up the crime,\" Ruetten told the parole board, which was considering releasing Lazarus as early as July.\n\n\"She lied for decades until her only option was to pursue parole,\" he added, noting Lazarus' denial of the crime at her arrest in 2009, during her trial three years later and through repeated appeals.\n\nLazarus was a detective with 25 years on the force when homicide investigators reopened Rasmussen's cold case and tested DNA from a bite mark on the victim. The 2009 examination led to Lazarus' arrest in the death of the 29-year-old nursing director.\n\nThree years later, Lazarus was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 27 years to life in prison at the California Institution for Women in Chino.\n\nOn Monday, Rasmussen's friends and family -- including two sisters and two nieces -- begged the parole board to keep Lazarus locked up, saying she is a cold, calculating killer working the system she knows everything about as a former cop.\n\nConnie Rasmussen said far from being a \"youthful offender\" -- as justice reform advocates have described Lazurus, who was 25 at the time of the slaying -- her sister's killer was an educated cop who graduated from UCLA and committed a \"well-planned and executed murder.\"\n\nIn contrast, justice reform advocates, formerly incarcerated persons and a wrongly convicted inmate told tales of Lazarus' prison leadership and work in education programs, religious advocacy, comforting dying inmates and even buying books for others.\n\n\"Stephanie is kind, compassionate and a dedicated individual. She has taken full responsibility for her actions,\" said Jane Dorotik of the Los Angeles Innocence Project, who served 12 years alongside Lazarus before her own murder conviction was overturned. \"I saw many women who talked a big talk about giving back to the community. Stephanie actually accomplished it.\"\n\nA nun, two college professors and several formerly incarcerated people called Lazarus a \"transformed person\" who \"worked tirelessly to improve herself\" and others. One former inmate described how Lazarus helped her turn her life around in prison as her \"personal mentor,\" enabling her to graduate from college.\n\nLazarus did not appear before the board Monday, but spoke to the panel in November.\n\n\"It makes me sick to this day that I took an oath to protect and serve people, and I took Sherri Rasmussen's life from her, a nurse,\" Lazarus said, according to a transcript of the hearing. \"All I could think about was getting out of there before the police showed up.\"\n\nRuetten, however, told parole commissioners on Monday the \"inmate\" -- as he called Lazarus -- is a master of deception.\n\n\"Sherri's parents lost her child, and her sisters lost a dear friend and confidante because Sherri loved and married me,\" he said, his voice quivering. \"For me, the reality of the pain never subsides.\"\n\nRuetten and Lazarus met as students at UCLA in the 1970s. Though the two dated casually for a few years after graduating, Ruetten testified at trial that he never considered Lazarus his girlfriend.\n\nHe later met Rasmussen, and they became engaged. Soon after, Ruetten said, he was confronted by Lazarus, then an LAPD patrol officer, who pleaded with him not to get married. Ruetten and Rasmussen wed in 1985.\n\nThe following year, Ruetten returned home from work to find Rasmussen badly beaten and with three gunshot wounds to the chest. The initial investigation determined Rasmussen died during a robbery by two men at the home, but no arrests were made.\n\nThe case was reopened in 2009, and DNA was run on a saliva sample taken as evidence from a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm. The sample was found to have come from a woman. Undercover officers collected Lazarus' DNA, and after a match was made against the bite-mark evidence, she was arrested.\n\nGreg Stearns, a veteran LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division detective who made the arrest, told the parole board on Monday that Lazarus does not deserve to be released.\n\n\"Stephanie Lazarus stalked her victim, chose a time and place when she knew she would have the victim alone. Brought cordage to bind her, used an improvised suppressor to execute her, staged a burglary and then disposed of the murder weapon and filed a false police report with an outside agency to explain the absence of that weapon,\" he told the panel. \"Those are not the hallmarks of youthful offense. They are the hallmarks of criminal sophistication and maturity.\"\n\nHe said if someone comes between something Lazarus desires, \"she is capable of that level of savagery and violence\" again.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_of_Bethany", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lazarus of Bethany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parole board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sherri_Rasmussen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder of Sherri Rasmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institution_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Institution for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot_wound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunshot wound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i3.wp.com/todayheadline.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/urlhttps3A2F2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com2F652Fe02F8228b5b44c0da5be07c48647ce712Fdetective-killing-1024x538.jpeg?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587499", "eventUri": "eng-9587499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

I will never, ever harm an individual like I did on February 24, 1986, when I murdered, callously murdered and heinously murdered Sherri Rasmussen,\" the transcript quotes Lazarus as saying.\n\nNewsom subsequently asked the full parole board to review the parole grant for Lazarus, who is now 64 and serving a 27-years-to-life state prison sentence.\n\nIn his April 4 request to the state parole board, the governor wrote, \"I commend her for her efforts in rehabilitation and encourage her to continue on this positive path. However, I find that this case warrants the consideration of the full Board of Parole Hearings to determine whether Ms. Lazarus can be safely released at this time. ... I ask the full board to determine whether her rehabilitative progress is sufficient to support her safe release.\"\n\nThe governor noted that she had \"evaded justice for more than two decades and did not appear to begin taking full accountability for the murder until she was finally caught,\" while noting that she \"has desisted from violent conduct\" since the crime and \"participated in and internalized targeted rehabilitative programming, signs that she has made progress in mitigating her risk factors.\"\n\nAt the hearing Monday, two of the victim's sisters and two of her nieces joined Los Angeles police Detective Greg Stearns, former prosecutor Paul Nunez, two of the victim's friends and an attorney representing the victim's family in opposing the parole grant.\n\nThe victim's sister, Connie, said she didn't believe that Lazarus met the intent of the state's youthful offender statute under which she is now eligible for parole, saying that Lazarus had a college degree from UCLA and had undergone an extensive psychological examination at the police academy.\n\nStearns told the parole board that Lazarus \"stalked\" her victim, chose a time and place where she would be alone, shot her to death, staged a burglary and made a false report to explain the absence of her gun.\n\n\"Those are not the hallmarks of a youthful offender. Those are the hallmarks of criminal sophistication,\" the detective said, urging the board to consider a January letter sent by the Los Angeles Police Department \"in opposition\" to Lazarus' parole grant.\n\nIn the letter, then-LAPD Chief Michel Moore wrote that \"the LAPD adamantly opposes the parole of Stephanie Lazarus, as she represents an unreasonable threat to the public safety of the citizens of Los Angeles.\n\nMoore noted in the letter, \"With the identification of Lazarus as the person responsible for killing Sherri, it became apparent Lazarus utilized her police training to facilitate, commit, and ultimately obscure her involvement in the crime. For 23 years, Lazarus was free to live her life without facing the consequences of her horrific actions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Lazarus' supporters, who have dealt with her since she's been in prison, told the parole board they believed she is remorseful and that her release on parole should go forward.\n\nOne called her a \"healed and transformed person\" who has \"worked tirelessly to improve herself,\" and another called her a \"community builder\" and cited her \"warmth, friendliness and outgoing nature.\"\n\nA former state prison inmate said Lazarus has been a \"personal mentor\" to her, saying that she enrolled in and graduated from college because of Lazarus, whom she said should be allowed to \"reintegrate back into society.\"\n\nLazarus retired from the LAPD after being arrested by Robbery-Homicide Division detectives at the department's downtown headquarters, largely as a result of DNA evidence taken from a bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm.\n\nLAPD detectives had trailed Lazarus to surreptitiously get a DNA sample from her in May 2009 by collecting a drink cup and straw she had thrown in a trash can outside a Costco store.\n\nRasmussen's father, Nels, had insisted shortly after his daughter's killing that police investigate Lazarus, who had been an officer for two years at the time of Rasmussen's death. But the case went cold until 2004, when investigators with the LAPD's Cold Case Unit reopened the case and asked the coroner's office to locate the bite mark tissue sample, which had been stored in a freezer in an evidence room since 1986, according to a 2015 ruling by a three-justice panel from California's 2nd District Court of Appeal that upheld Lazarus' conviction.\n\nDNA testing determined that the major profile was from a female, and investigators turned their attention toward specific women who might have had reason to harm Rasmussen, according to the ruling.\n\nThe appellate court panel noted in its ruling that Lazarus' DNA profile \"precisely matched the profile of the person who bit Rasmussen shortly before her death.\"\n\nLazarus had a \"compelling motive to kill Rasmussen\" because she had been abruptly dropped by Ruetten when he met his future wife, and Lazarus had confronted Rasmussen at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where the 29-year-old woman worked as a nursing supervisor, the justices noted in the 2015 ruling.\n\nRuetten and Rasmussen were married in November 1985, a few months after Lazarus wrote Ruetten's mother that she was \"truly in love with John,\" the appellate court panel noted.\n\n\"The evidence of motive and the circumstantial evidence, combined with the presence of appellant's DNA on a wound inflicted on the victim during her struggles with her assailant, provided convincing evidence of appellant's guilt,\" Associate Justice Nora Manella wrote on behalf of the panel in its 2015 ruling.\n\nThe California Supreme Court refused in October 2015 to review the case against Lazarus.\n\nAfter the verdict, then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called the case \"a tragedy on every level\" and apologized for how long it took to \"solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy.\"", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gavin Newsom can still overrule the executive committee.\n\nThe extraordinary case of Stephanie Lazarus took another turn Monday, with the state parole board's executive committee upholding a recommendation for parole for the former Los Angeles police detective convicted of murdering her former boyfriend's wife in 1986.\n\nThe decision followed testimony from supporters that she had turned her life around behind bars, as well as pleas from the victim's friends and family that Lazarus is a master of manipulation and should remain locked up.\n\nThe case attracted national attention when police detectives used DNA to identify her as the killer 23 years after the murder. Lazarus was a 25-year-old patrol officer at the time of the killing. And she was a detective assigned to investigate high end art thefts at the time of her arrest in 2009.\n\nLazarus beat Sherri Rasmussen and shot her three times in the chest in the Van Nuys apartment Rasmussen shared with her husband John Ruetten, according to prosecutors. Lazarus had warned her ex-boyfriend not to marry Rasmussen, a 29-year-old hospital nursing director at the time.\n\nLazarus was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison.\n\nShe is eligible for early parole because she committed the crime when she was 24-years-old. Under the state's Youthful Offender Program, people who commit crimes before the age of 26 are considered to lack impulse control and an ability to fully understand consequences and therefore should be eligible for early parole.\n\nLazarus is now 64.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom can still overrule the executive committee.\n\nDuring a hearing, supporters and opponents of Lazarus' release painted a starkly different picture of the former police officer.\n\n\"Stephanie is a kind, compassionate and dedicated individual,\" said Jane Dorotik of the California Coalition for Women Prisoners. Dorotik served time in prison with Lazarus and has maintained contact with her since her own release.\n\n\"She has taken full responsibility for her actions many years ago. And she has complete and unending remorse,\" Dorotik said.\n\nAnother supporter pointed out how Lazarus had started a nonprofit to provide money for college books for fellow prisoners.\n\nA woman who identified herself as Lazarus' chaplain and spiritual advisor said Lazarus had committed her life to Jesus Christ.\n\n\"In the 15 years of being her chaplain, I've had few inmates delve into God's word as seriously and devotedly as Stephanie,\" said Gloria Burr. \"She is indeed a healed and transformed person.\"\n\nLazarus has earned a master's degree in divinity and is working on another in business administration, according to Erin Runions, a professor of religious studies at Pomona. Runions said she knows Lazarus through a prison writing project where students work with people who are incarcerated.\n\n\"I've seen a person who is remorseful, who is caring, and who is very ready to reenter society,\" she said.\n\nBut Rasmussen's husband maintained that Lazarus was engaged in \"skillful deception\" of her supporters and the board that recommended her release.\n\n\"I have come to believe that her basic nature is concealing her thoughts and feelings,\" Ruetten said.\n\nLazarus was not present at the hearing.\n\nPaul Nunez, the Ventura deputy district attorney who prosecuted her case, argued Lazarus has never shown complete remorse for her crime and remains a danger to the public.\n\n\"Commissioners, I ask that you protect the public,\" said Nunez. \"Require more time in custody for her to explore the insights of her crime.\"\n\nOne of the LAPD detectives who investigated Lazarus also urged the board to keep her locked up. Detective John Taylor said he believes Lazarus remains \"fully capable of the level of savagery and violence that she perpetrated on Sherri.\"\n\nThrough tears, Rasmussen's niece Jessica Pannell mourned the loss of her aunt.\n\n\"Sherri was a cherished member of our family and a pillar in her community,\" Pannell said. \"Her loss has left a void that can never be filled in our family and her friends and her career.\"\n\nShe pleaded with the board not to release Lazarus.\n\nThe board is required to base its decisions on whether the incarcerated person poses a current, unreasonable risk of danger to the public, according to its website. In making its decision, the board considers \"the incarcerated person's rehabilitative programming, behavior during their incarceration, criminal history, and other evidence-based risk factors.\"\n\nThe board may not base its decision solely on the commitment offense.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sherri_Rasmussen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder of Sherri Rasmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_of_Bethany", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lazarus of Bethany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Nuys", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Van Nuys"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Van Nuys"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Art theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chaplain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rehabilitation (penology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pomona, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pomona, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a1f5d8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/149x78+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fi%2Fdc151c4609e99c1a71da166ebbf01696%2F5b2c50b84488b3000927c691-original.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587499", "eventUri": "eng-9587499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe decision came one day after the victim's family members objected to a parole board panel's earlier recommendation of parole for Stephanie Ilene Lazarus, who confessed at a hearing in November that she had murdered her ex-lover's new wife, Sherri Rasmussen.\n\nAnother hearing is expected to be scheduled within four months, when a panel will review new information to determine whether there is good cause to rescind the parole grant for Lazarus or whether the prior hearing panel made a fundamental error and improperly granted parole, according to Mary Xjimenez of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nAt Monday's hearing in Sacramento, Rasmussen's widower, John Ruetten, told the parole board that Lazarus -- whom he referred to as \"the inmate\" -- \"lied for decades until her only option was to pursue parole.\"\n\nSpeaking to the board remotely, Ruetten said his slain wife's parents lost a child and her sisters lost a dear friend and confidante \"because Sherri loved and married me.\"\n\n\"For me, this reality and pain never subside,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"I respectfully request you revoke her grant for parole.\"\n\nA state parole board panel recommended parole Nov. 16 for Lazarus, an art theft investigator and 25-year LAPD veteran who was convicted in March 2012 of first-degree murder for the Feb. 24, 1986, killing of Sherri Rasmussen.\n\nAt that November hearing, Lazarus publicly admitted that she had killed the 29-year-old Glendale Adventist Medical Center nursing supervisor.\n\nRasmussen was shot three times in the Balboa Boulevard condominium she shared with her husband. Rasmussen had married Ruetten, Lazarus' one-time love interest, three months before her death.\n\n\"It makes me sick to this day that I took an oath to protect and serve people, and I took Sherri Rasmussen's life from her, a nurse,\" Lazarus said, according to a transcript of the November parole hearing. \"All I could think about was getting out of there before the police showed up.\"\n\nShe said she subsequently threw the gun into a bushy area off the freeway and reported her gun stolen to the Santa Monica Police Department, according to the transcript.\n\nLazarus did not appear before the parole board at its hearing Monday.\n\nBut the transcript from her parole hearing in November quotes her as saying, \"I never got comfortable thinking I got away with this. ...

I will never, ever harm an individual like I did on February 24, 1986, when I murdered, callously murdered and heinously murdered Sherri Rasmussen,\" the transcript quotes Lazarus as saying.\n\nNewsom subsequently asked the full parole board to review the parole grant for Lazarus, who is now 64 and serving a 27-year-to-life state prison sentence.\n\nIn his April 4 request to the state parole board, the governor wrote, \"I commend her for her efforts in rehabilitation and encourage her to continue on this positive path. However, I find that this case warrants the consideration of the full Board of Parole Hearings to determine whether Ms. Lazarus can be safely released at this time. ... I ask the full board to determine whether her rehabilitative progress is sufficient to support her safe release.\"\n\nThe governor noted that she had \"evaded justice for more than two decades and did not appear to begin taking full accountability for the murder until she was finally caught,\" while noting that she \"has desisted from violent conduct\" since the crime and \"participated in and internalized targeted rehabilitative programming, signs that she has made progress in mitigating her risk factors.\"\n\nAt the hearing Monday, two of the victim's sisters and two of her nieces joined Los Angeles police Detective Greg Stearns, former prosecutor Paul Nunez, two of the victim's friends and an attorney representing the victim's family in opposing the parole grant.\n\nThe victim's sister, Connie, said she didn't believe that Lazarus met the intent of the state's youthful offender statute under which she is now eligible for parole, saying that Lazarus had a college degree from UCLA and had undergone an extensive psychological examination at the police academy.\n\nStearns told the parole board that Lazarus \"stalked\" her victim, chose a time and place where she would be alone, shot her to death, staged a burglary and made a false report to explain the absence of her gun.\n\n\"Those are not the hallmarks of a youthful offender. Those are the hallmarks of criminal sophistication,\" the detective said, urging the board to consider a January letter sent by the Los Angeles Police Department \"in opposition\" to Lazarus' parole grant.\n\nIn the letter, then-LAPD Chief Michel Moore wrote that \"the LAPD adamantly opposes the parole of Stephanie Lazarus, as she represents an unreasonable threat to the public safety of the citizens of Los Angeles.\n\nMoore noted in the letter, \"With the identification of Lazarus as the person responsible for killing Sherri, it became apparent Lazarus utilized her police training to facilitate, commit, and ultimately obscure her involvement in the crime. For 23 years, Lazarus was free to live her life without facing the consequences of her horrific actions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Lazarus' supporters, who have dealt with her since she's been in prison, told the parole board they believed she is remorseful and that her release on parole should go forward.\n\nOne called her a \"healed and transformed person\" who has \"worked tirelessly to improve herself,\" and another called her a \"community builder\" and cited her \"warmth, friendliness and outgoing nature.\"\n\nA former state prison inmate said Lazarus has been a \"personal mentor\" to her, saying that she enrolled in and graduated from college because of Lazarus, whom she said should be allowed to \"reintegrate back into society.\"\n\nLazarus retired from the LAPD after being arrested by Robbery-Homicide Division detectives at the department's downtown headquarters, largely as a result of DNA evidence taken from a bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm.\n\nLAPD detectives had trailed Lazarus to surreptitiously get a DNA sample from her in May 2009 by collecting a drink cup and straw she had thrown in a trash can outside a Costco store.\n\nRasmussen's father, Nels, had insisted shortly after his daughter's killing that police investigate Lazarus, who had been an officer for two years at the time of Rasmussen's death. But the case went cold until 2004, when investigators with the LAPD's Cold Case Unit reopened the case and asked the coroner's office to locate the bite mark tissue sample, which had been stored in a freezer in an evidence room since 1986, according to a 2015 ruling by a three-justice panel from California's 2nd District Court of Appeal that upheld Lazarus' conviction.\n\nDNA testing determined that the major profile was from a female, and investigators turned their attention toward specific women who might have had reason to harm Rasmussen, according to the ruling.\n\nThe appellate court panel noted in its ruling that Lazarus' DNA profile \"precisely matched the profile of the person who bit Rasmussen shortly before her death.\"\n\nLazarus had a \"compelling motive to kill Rasmussen\" because she had been abruptly dropped by Ruetten when he met his future wife, and Lazarus had confronted Rasmussen at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, where the 29-year-old woman worked as a nursing supervisor, the justices noted in the 2015 ruling.\n\nRuetten and Rasmussen were married in November 1985, a few months after Lazarus wrote Ruetten's mother that she was \"truly in love with John,\" the appellate court panel noted.\n\n\"The evidence of motive and the circumstantial evidence, combined with the presence of appellant's DNA on a wound inflicted on the victim during her struggles with her assailant, provided convincing evidence of appellant's guilt,\" Associate Justice Nora Manella wrote on behalf of the panel in its 2015 ruling.\n\nThe California Supreme Court refused in October 2015 to review the case against Lazarus.\n\nAfter the verdict, then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called the case \"a tragedy on every level\" and apologized for how long it took to \"solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy.\"", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The full board took up her case on Monday and later voted to order a rescission hearing, referring the case to a lower panel to consider whether to rescind the earlier recommendation.\n\nRasmussen\u00b4s sisters and widower gave emotional testimony during Monday's hearing about their pain and described Lazarus as a conniving criminal who used her police training to cover up the killing.\n\nRuetten told the board he doesn't believe that Lazarus - whom he referred to only as \"the inmate\" - feels remorse. He said she engaged in \"skillful deception\" and only confessed to the crime during a hearing last year in order to gain parole.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t think she comprehends the breadth and depth of the suffering she has caused,\" a tearful Ruetten said.\n\nFILE - In this July 6, 2009 file photo, former Los Angeles detective Stephanie Lazarus appears in court in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Al Seib, Pool, File)\n\nAmong those speaking on behalf of Lazarus was Erin Runions, a college professor who co-facilitates a writing workshop for incarcerated people inside the California Institution for Women. She spoke to Lazarus' \"spiritual growth\" and commitment to earning advanced degrees while behind bars so that she'll be ready to find a job and contribute to the community if she's released.\n\n\"I\u00b4ve seen a person who is remorseful, who is caring, and who is very ready to reenter society,\" Runions said during the hearing.\n\nThe governor\u00b4s office had asked the board in April to review the plan to parole Lazarus. John Taylor, an attorney for Rasmussen's family, said he was relieved by Monday's decision.\n\n\"We look forward to participating in the rescission hearing and hope that the parole grant is rescinded,\" Taylor said Tuesday. He said he expected the hearing to be scheduled within about four months.\n\nLazarus did not appear before the board Monday.\n\nAt her trial 12 years ago, prosecutors focused on the romantic relationship between Lazarus and Ruetten after they graduated from college. They claimed Lazarus was consumed with jealousy when Ruetten decided to marry Rasmussen.\n\nThe case hinged on DNA from a bite mark prosecutors say Lazarus left on Rasmussen\u00b4s arm.\n\nLazarus was not a suspect in 1986 because detectives then believed two robbers who had attacked another woman in the area were to blame for Rasmussen\u00b4s death. The case file, however, did mention Lazarus because of her relationship with Ruetten.\n\nNo suspects were found and the case went cold until May 2009, when undercover officers followed Lazarus and obtained a sample of her saliva to compare with DNA left at the original crime scene, police said.\n\nProsecutors suggested Lazarus knew to avoid leaving other evidence, such as fingerprints. The idea that saliva from a bite mark could be her undoing was inconceivable in 1986 when DNA wasn\u00b4t used as a forensic tool.\n\nLazarus rose in the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department, becoming a detective in charge of art forgeries and thefts.\n\nFILE - Former Los Angeles detective Stephanie Lazarus appears in court July 29, 2009, in Los Angeles.

Rasmussen was shot to death inside her Van Nuys condominium by Lazarus, who was jealous of her ex-lover's new wife.\n\nRuetten told the board that Lazarus lied for decades until her only option was to pursue parole. He said his slain wife's parents lost a child and her sisters lost a dear friend and confidante \"because Sherri loved and married me.\"\n\nA state parole board panel recommended parole Nov. 16 for Lazarus, an art theft investigator and 25-year LAPD veteran.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom subsequently asked the full parole board to review the parole grant for Lazarus, who is now 64 and serving a 27-year-to-life state prison sentence. The board is expected to issue a ruling Tuesday.\n\nAt a hearing last Nov. 16, Lazarus publicly admitted that she had killed the Glendale Adventist Medical Center nursing supervisor.\n\nRasmussen was shot three times in the Balboa Boulevard condominium she shared with Ruetten, her husband. Rasmussen had married Ruetten, Lazarus' one-time love interest, three months before her death.\n\n\"It makes me sick to this day that I took an oath to protect and serve people, and I took Sherri Rasmussen's life from her, a nurse,\" Lazarus said, according to a transcript of the parole hearing last November.\n\n\"I didn't do the right thing because I didn't want to face the consequences of my actions. I didn't want to go to prison.\"\n\nShe said she subsequently threw the gun into a bushy area off the freeway and reported her gun stolen to the Santa Monica Police Department, according to the transcript.\n\nShe continued to say at last November's hearing that she will never harm another person like she did on Feb. 24, 1986, \"When I murdered, callously murdered and heinously murdered Sherri Rasmussen,\" the transcript read.\n\nTwo of the victim's sisters and two of her nieces joined Los Angeles police Det.

Put a value on the impact of our year-round coverage. Help us continue to highlight LA stories, hold the powerful accountable, and amplify community voices. Your support keeps our reporting free for all to use. Stand with us today.\n\nThe extraordinary case of Stephanie Lazarus took another turn Monday, with the state parole board's executive committee upholding a recommendation for parole for the former Los Angeles police detective convicted of murdering her former boyfriend's wife in 1986.\n\nThe decision followed testimony from supporters that she had turned her life around behind bars, as well as pleas from the victim's friends and family that Lazarus is a master of manipulation and should remain locked up.\n\nThe case attracted national attention when police detectives used DNA to identify her as the killer 23 years after the murder. Lazarus was a 25-year-old patrol officer at the time of the killing. And she was a detective assigned to investigate high end art thefts at the time of her arrest in 2009.\n\nLazarus beat Sherri Rasmussen and shot her three times in the chest in the Van Nuys apartment Rasmussen shared with her husband John Ruetten, according to prosecutors. Lazarus had warned her ex-boyfriend not to marry Rasmussen, a 29-year-old hospital nursing director at the time.\n\nLazarus was sentenced to 27 years to life in prison.\n\nShe is eligible for early parole because she committed the crime when she was 24-years-old. Under the state's Youthful Offender Program, people who commit crimes before the age of 26 are considered to lack impulse control and an ability to fully understand consequences and therefore should be eligible for early parole.\n\nLazarus is now 64.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom can still overrule the executive committee.\n\nDuring a hearing, supporters and opponents of Lazarus' release painted a starkly different picture of the former police officer.\n\n\"Stephanie is a kind, compassionate and dedicated individual,\" said Jane Dorotik of the California Coalition for Women Prisoners. Dorotik served time in prison with Lazarus and has maintained contact with her since her own release.\n\n\"She has taken full responsibility for her actions many years ago. And she has complete and unending remorse,\" Dorotik said.\n\nAnother supporter pointed out how Lazarus had started a nonprofit to provide money for college books for fellow prisoners.\n\nA woman who identified herself as Lazarus' chaplain and spiritual advisor said Lazarus had committed her life to Jesus Christ.\n\n\"In the 15 years of being her chaplain, I've had few inmates delve into God's word as seriously and devotedly as Stephanie,\" said Gloria Burr. \"She is indeed a healed and transformed person.\"\n\nLazarus has earned a master's degree in divinity and is working on another in business administration, according to Erin Runions, a professor of religious studies at Pomona. Runions said she knows Lazarus through a prison writing project where students work with people who are incarcerated.\n\n\"I've seen a person who is remorseful, who is caring, and who is very ready to reenter society,\" she said.\n\nBut Rasmussen's husband maintained that Lazarus was engaged in \"skillful deception\" of her supporters and the board that recommended her release.\n\n\"I have come to believe that her basic nature is concealing her thoughts and feelings,\" Ruetten said.\n\nLazarus was not present at the hearing.\n\nPaul Nunez, the Ventura deputy district attorney who prosecuted her case, argued Lazarus has never shown complete remorse for her crime and remains a danger to the public.\n\n\"Commissioners, I ask that you protect the public,\" said Nunez. \"Require more time in custody for her to explore the insights of her crime.\"\n\nOne of the LAPD detectives who investigated Lazarus also urged the board to keep her locked up. Detective John Taylor said he believes Lazarus remains \"fully capable of the level of savagery and violence that she perpetrated on Sherri.\"\n\nThrough tears, Rasmussen's niece Jessica Pannell mourned the loss of her aunt.\n\n\"Sherri was a cherished member of our family and a pillar in her community,\" Pannell said. \"Her loss has left a void that can never be filled in our family and her friends and her career.\"\n\nShe pleaded with the board not to release Lazarus.\n\nThe board is required to base its decisions on whether the incarcerated person poses a current, unreasonable risk of danger to the public, according to its website. In making its decision, the board considers \"the incarcerated person's rehabilitative programming, behavior during their incarceration, criminal history, and other evidence-based risk factors.\"\n\nThe board may not base its decision solely on the commitment offense.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The full board took up her case on Monday and later voted to order a rescission hearing, referring the case to a lower panel to consider whether to rescind the earlier recommendation.\n\nRasmussen's sisters and widower gave emotional testimony during Monday's hearing about their pain and described Lazarus as a conniving criminal who used her police training to cover up the killing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He said she engaged in \"skillful deception\" and only confessed to the crime during a hearing last year in order to gain parole.\n\n\"I don't think she comprehends the breadth and depth of the suffering she has caused,\" a tearful Ruetten said.\n\nAmong those speaking on behalf of Lazarus was Erin Runions, a college professor who co-facilitates a writing workshop for incarcerated people inside the California Institution for Women. She spoke to Lazarus' \"spiritual growth\" and commitment to earning advanced degrees while behind bars so that she'll be ready to find a job and contribute to the community if she's released.\n\n\"I've seen a person who is remorseful, who is caring, and who is very ready to reenter society,\" Runions said during the hearing.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe governor's office had asked the board in April to review the plan to parole Lazarus. John Taylor, an attorney for Rasmussen's family, said he was relieved by Monday's decision.\n\n\"We look forward to participating in the rescission hearing and hope that the parole grant is rescinded,\" Taylor said Tuesday. He said he expected the hearing to be scheduled within about four months.\n\nLazarus did not appear before the board Monday.\n\nAt her trial 12 years ago, prosecutors focused on the romantic relationship between Lazarus and Ruetten after they graduated from college. They claimed Lazarus was consumed with jealousy when Ruetten decided to marry Rasmussen.\n\nThe case hinged on DNA from a bite mark prosecutors say Lazarus left on Rasmussen's arm.\n\nLazarus was not a suspect in 1986 because detectives then believed two robbers who had attacked another woman in the area were to blame for Rasmussen's death. The case file, however, did mention Lazarus because of her relationship with Ruetten.\n\nNo suspects were found and the case went cold until May 2009, when undercover officers followed Lazarus and obtained a sample of her saliva to compare with DNA left at the original crime scene, police said.\n\nProsecutors suggested Lazarus knew to avoid leaving other evidence, such as fingerprints. The idea that saliva from a bite mark could be her undoing was inconceivable in 1986 when DNA wasn't used as a forensic tool.\n\nLazarus rose in the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department, becoming a detective in charge of art forgeries and thefts.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Victim's family fought back", "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Despite a campaign by justice reform advocates, the California Board of Parole Hearings has revoked plans to release former LAPD Detective Stephanie Lazarus from prison after hearing emotional testimony from family and friends who said she \"lied for decades\" and used her police training to cover up the 1986 murder of her ex-boyfriend's wife.\n\nThe decision marks another chapter in a notorious murder case that rocked the Los Angeles Police Department. It overturns a November recommendation by a parole panel that the 64-year-old should be set free after serving 15 years of her life sentence and a new hearing be held to examine evidence in the case. The governor's office had asked the board in April to review the plan to parole Lazarus.\n\nA tear ran down John Ruetten's cheek Monday as he recalled the \"brutal murder\" of his wife, Sherri Rasmussen, by a jealous Lazarus, who finally confessed to the crime last year at a parole panel.\n\n\"We're not here today -- 38 years after Sherri's brutal murder, reliving the horror -- because of an impulsive act. [It was] skillful deception and complete disregard for the suffering of others. The inmate used her police training to cover up the crime,\" Ruetten told the parole board, which was considering releasing Lazarus as early as July.\n\n\"She lied for decades until her only option was to pursue parole,\" he added, noting Lazarus' denial of the crime at her arrest in 2009, during her trial three years later and through repeated appeals.\n\nLazarus was a detective with 25 years on the force when homicide investigators reopened Rasmussen's cold case and tested DNA from a bite mark on the victim. The 2009 examination led to Lazarus' arrest in the death of the 29-year-old nursing director.\n\nThree years later, Lazarus was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 27 years to life in prison at the California Institution for Women in Chino.\n\nOn Monday, Rasmussen's friends and family -- including two sisters and two nieces -- begged the parole board to keep Lazarus locked up, saying she is a cold, calculating killer working the system she knows everything about as a former cop.\n\nConnie Rasmussen said far from being a \"youthful offender\" -- as justice reform advocates have described Lazurus, who was 25 at the time of the slaying -- her sister's killer was an educated cop who graduated from UCLA and committed a \"well-planned and executed murder.\"\n\nIn contrast, justice reform advocates, formerly incarcerated persons and a wrongly convicted inmate told tales of Lazarus' prison leadership and work in education programs, religious advocacy, comforting dying inmates and even buying books for others.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sherri_Rasmussen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder of Sherri Rasmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parole board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institution_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Institution for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/290/29027/2902756.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587499", "eventUri": "eng-9587499", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

He said Lazarus would be credited with 1,608 days, or nearly 4? years, for good behavior and time already served.\n\nHer defense attorney said an appeal has been filed.\n\nOutside court, Lazarus' brother and mother said their hearts go out to Rasmussen's family, but they still support Lazarus and believe she did not get a fair trial.\n\n\"There was never a presumption of innocence,\" said Steve Lazarus. \"The media got to listen to DNA and guilt for 2 1/2 years before Stephanie had her trial.\"\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors focused on the romantic relationship between Lazarus and Ruetten after they graduated from college.

Her husband attended most of the trial, along with other family members.\n\nThe Rasmussen family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the LAPD and the city of Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dailynews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sherri_Rasmussen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder of Sherri Rasmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_of_Bethany", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lazarus of Bethany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Perry_(yacht_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Perry (yacht designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blunt trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presumption of innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saliva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful death claim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Beck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Beck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587499", "eventUri": "eng-9587499", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2009-05-", "textStart": 2180, "textEnd": 2188}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

These wallets collectively hold 891.13 BTC.\n\nAlso Read: Anonymous Crypto Influencer Exposes Notorious Lazarus Group in Detailed Report\n\nIn a recent investigation conducted by crypto sleuth ZachXBT, it was discovered that the Lazarus Group from North Korea managed to convert approximately $200M worth of cryptocurrency into fiat currency from August 2020 to October 2023.\n\nZachXBT meticulously examined over 25 hacks that occurred on different blockchains, carefully tracking the movement of funds through coin mixers and exchanges from August 2020 to October 2023. According to the report, the Lazarus Group used several coin mixers to launder $200M. These mixers concealed the source and destination of transactions by combining them with other tokens, transactions, and addresses.\n\nThe hackers used the Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash and the Bitcoin-based ChipMixer in their operations. Furthermore, tokens were moved across various blockchains to make it more difficult to trace the funds. The group also engaged peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges such as Noones and Paxful, facilitating direct asset exchanges with individuals.\n\nOn May 21, ZachXBT shared 7 additional wallet addresses on X linked to Lazarus Group, holding $61.8M. This follows his previous expos\u00e9 on the group which resulted in the authorities freezing $3.8M worth of digital assets.\n\nThe Lazarus Group reemerged earlier this year following a period of inactivity. On January 8th, the hackers successfully transferred $1.2M in stolen digital assets from a mixer and redirected a portion of the funds to an inactive wallet.\n\nAs of now, the crypto wallets identified by ZachXBT continues to hold the reported amounts.\n\nIn recent years, the Lazarus Group has been identified as the perpetrator behind several high-profile cryptocurrency hacks.

That theory was debunked in 2005 when a bite mark was discovered on the victim and the DNA left behind was found to have come from a woman.\n\nIn 2009, LAPD detective Stephanie Lazarus was arrested for the murder of Sherri Rasmussen when the DNA found at the crime scene matched hers. The Rasmussens sued the LAPD, alleging that its officers handling of the case caused them emotional distress, especially investigators' refusal to take serious their claims about Lazurus.\n\nLazurus and John Ruetten had dated before he marred Sherri Rasmussen three months before her death.\n\nInvestigators initially suspected a robber had beat and shot Sherri Rasmussen to death, even though the victims' parents badgered police, telling them that Lazurus had stalked their daughter and confronted her in the weeks before her murder. In 2009, cold case investigators arrested Lazarus after finding her DNA at the crime scene.\n\nA trial court judge and then an appeals court both reluctantly tossed out the couple's 2010 lawsuit as being filed way too late. The courts ruled that even the most liberal reading of the statute of limitations prevented the couple from filing their civil claims after 1998.\n\nA jury convicted Lazarus of first-degree murder in 2012.

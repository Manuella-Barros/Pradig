They may be seeking care because of a breakdown of supports or the inability of the patient, or their family, to cope with living at home. These people are known colloquially as \"social admissions,\" and other labels such as \"orphan patient,\" \"failure to cope,\" and others have been applied.\n\n\"The 'social admission' phenomenon is an under-researched area in health care,\" writes Dr. Jasmine Mah, an internal medicine resident with an interest in geriatrics at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, with coauthors. \"These patients, often categorized by health care providers as not being acutely ill, experience in-hospital death rates as high as 22.2%-34.9%. Explanations may include under-triaging in the emergency department owing to poor recognition of atypical clinical presentations and delays in timely assessments.\"\n\nFurthermore, patients may be misdiagnosed or develop acute illness in hospital.\n\nTo better understand this category of patients, researchers undertook a qualitative study to explore the views of health care providers on patients admitted as \"social admissions\" in Nova Scotia. They identified 9 themes, including stigma, prejudices such as ageism, wait-lists, and other factors that contributed to views about caring for these patients.\n\n\"Our findings highlight the potential adverse effects on care when patients are labelled as 'socially admitted' (or as 'orphan patients' in the study hospital), such as incorrect assumptions about medical needs and cognitive abilities, which impedes opportunities to look for treatable medical issues,\" write the authors.\n\nLabelling patients negatively affects their health and can have a negative impact on health care providers. Many providers were conflicted in how to deliver care and felt that these patients deserved care, but almost always from someone else.\n\n\"This pattern of downgrading care can lead to situations in which 'socially admitted' patients are looked after by team members who possess minimal experience recognizing evolving medical presentations or lack the authority to advocate strongly for clinical reassessments when needed. The implication that the care of 'social admissions' should be delegated to others reflects an implicit attitude of hierarchy and detachment from the needs associated with this patient population,\" they write.\n\nThe authors urge a reform of current structures and hierarchies to improve care for these vulnerable people.\n\nIn a related editorialhttps://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.240577, CMAJ deputy editor and emergency medicine physician Dr. Catherine Varner, with coauthors Dr. Andrew Boozary, a primary care physician and executive director of the UHN Gattuso Centre for Social Medicine, Toronto, and CMAJ editor Dr. Andreas Laupacis, suggests we need to reframe this issue as a policy failure to help solve the problem.

Therefore, we aimed to explore the perceptions of health care providers regarding patients admitted as \"social admissions.\"", "source": {"uri": "cmaj.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canadian Medical Association Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(electoral_subdivision)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ward (electoral subdivision)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delirium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sepsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.cmaj.ca/sites/default/files/images/cmaj-social-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

However, patients are not to blame for the fact that home care is inadequate, long-term care is unavailable for a patient who really needs it, or lack of access to secure housing means managing a chronic condition in the community is impossible. We discuss how reframing this problem as a policy failure and applying evidence-based upstream policy investments could help to address it.\n\nMany hospital quality committees use the percentage of patients admitted to hospital who no longer need acute care (they occupy 10%-20% of hospital beds in many parts of the country) as a quality indicator, and \"alternate level of care throughput ratio\" is now a priority metric for Ontario Health's 2024/25 Quality Improvement Plan.23 The urgent need to open up hospital beds and mitigate emergency department crowding has led some governments to tell patients who are occupying an alternate level of care bed that they will be transferred to a long-term care bed many kilometres from where they live; if they do not wish to go, they will be charged for the hospital bed.4 Without other options available and amid unprecedented crowding, emergency department providers are also discharging patents to situations they know are likely harmful and hazardous. In almost all cases, clinicians and not the policy-makers are tasked with telling patients they need to go to a location that is unsafe, undesirable, or both.\n\nPunitive policies like these cause distress to patients, families, and providers and have not restored hospital occupancy to manageable levels. These policies are also at odds with most health care workers' deep commitment in wanting to do better for patients who are otherwise let down by the broader health and social care systems.1\n\nNonpunitive approaches are better for patients and decrease hospital admissions and costs.5 One approach is to embed personnel and programs that address the complex care needs of patients at risk of needing \"social admission\" within emergency departments.\n\nEmergency department pilot programs of peer support workers are underway, whereby people with previous or current lived experiences of marginalization, such as homelessness, mental illness, or substance use, help patients with similar lived experiences establish trust with the clinical team and navigate social supports within the community and avoid hospital admission. Recent literature on peer support workers in hospital-based settings shows that they provide critical support for patients accessing social supports and harm-reduction services.6\n\nGeriatric emergency medicine nurses and multidisciplinary geriatric teams are increasingly commonly embedded in Canadian emergency departments and help manage and coordinate the care of frail older adults with declines in function or cognition. These initiatives reduce admissions and decrease repeat visits in a cost-effective manner.7 However, they are not a replacement for community-based supports, such as adequate home care or access to long-term care.7\n\nHospitals are also expanding health care teams to include community health workers to help vulnerable people connect with health and social services. Often lay people living in the same community, community health workers tailor supports to the physical and mental health needs of the individual and assist with tasks such as helping with access to income supports, or accompany people to medical appointments. This shift aligns with the long-standing evidence of health and social care being shaped by conditions outside clinical settings.89\n\nA review from the World Health Organization concluded that community health workers extend health care services to vulnerable populations, meet health needs in a culturally appropriate manner, improve access to services, address inequities in health status, and improve health-system performance and efficiency.10 However, these gains are contingent on community health workers being integrated through public policy measures that include linkages to planning for health human resources and data sharing, and processes for addressing the myriad of governance, legal, and financing issues that arise when building strong community health worker programs.10\n\nCanada's health systems are fragmented, uncoordinated, and underresourced, and its social safety nets are frayed. Despite the promise of the programs described herein, they do not address the social determinants of health that can drive presentations to emergency departments. To restore human dignity in health care -- to properly address the barriers experienced by patients and the moral distress of health providers -- structural factors causing health disparities must be confronted as policy failures, not personal ones.", "source": {"uri": "cmaj.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canadian Medical Association Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Long-term care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Community health worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peer support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acute care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_human_resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social safety net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social determinants of health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harm reduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geriatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Community_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Community Health", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Policy_and_Regulation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Policy and Regulation", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.cmaj.ca/sites/default/files/images/cmaj-social-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Dying in the hospital or spending last days in the hospital is not associated with better outcomes, it's not associated with higher quality of life, it's costly and it sometimes goes against the patient's wishes.\n\n\"So, the goal is how do we how do we prevent this from happening, from patients dying in the hospital and receiving this intense care that may not be helpful and that they may not even want,\" said Gladys M. Rodriguez, MD, MS, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology and lead author of the study.\n\nLung cancer is leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current five-year survival rate is low, approximately 26.6%, because the cancer is typically detected and diagnosed when it has already advanced into later stages, according to a 2023 report from the American Lung Association.\n\nPrevious work has also shown disparities in lung cancer mortality among patients of racial and ethnic minorities compared to white patients. However, less is currently known about the intensity of care that patients receive at the end of life.\n\nIn the current study, Rodriguez and colleagues analyzed data from the California Cancer Registry database linked to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development patient discharge data and emergency department data to identify adult patients with a lung cancer diagnosis who died between the years 2005 and 2018.\n\nThe investigators' primary outcome was intensity of care in the 14 days before patient death. Intensity of care was defined as any hospital admission or emergency department visit, ICU admission, intubation, CPR, hemodialysis and death in an acute care setting. The team then used multivariable logistic regression models to identify associations between race and ethnicity and intensity of end-of-life care.\n\nThe investigators identified more than 200,000 patients with lung cancer who died from 2005 to 2018. The average age of patients was 75 years. Additionally, 51% of patients were male, 70.8% were white, 0.5% were Native American, 10.5% were Asian/Pacific Islander, 7.5% were Black and 10.8% were Hispanic.\n\nIn the last 14 days before death, the investigators found that Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic patients had higher intensity of end-of-life care and greater odds of a hospital or emergency department death compared to white patients.\n\nOverall, the findings highlight a need for optimizing care to improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities. One approach, Rodriguez said, is to rethink how and when palliative care or hospice care services are introduced to patients and their families.\n\nRodriguez added that health care providers and institutions need to sharpen their focus to address health literacy and language barriers, which can help patients and their families decide to receive appropriate care in a timelier manner.\n\n\"How do we communicate these difficult topics for patients in a way that they can understand? We need to meet them where they are based on the language they speak, the health literacy that they have, and then include our own clinicians to be able to deliver that information in a culturally appropriate way for patients,\" said Rodriguez, who is also a member of the Robert H.

For example, a 2021 report from the CD Howe Institute noted 61% of Canadians die in hospital, compared to 51% in England, 28% in the Netherlands, and 20% in the United States. The inaccessibility of home support is one factor leading to this disparity.\n\nThis trend must change for us to meet the ongoing challenges of an aging population and an overburdened health care system. Caring for people at home is one of the few wins we have in health care where we can save money and improve the quality of care.\n\nA 2023 report from the B.C. Office of the Seniors Advocate described a 42% increase in expenditures on home and community care over five years, which seems like great news until it notes that increase resulted in only 5% more care hours for patients.\n\nIn fact, on a per capita basis, the hours of care actually decreased. The additional funding is being absorbed by increased bureaucracy and administrative overhead, rather than going to provide additional patient care. That is poor value for the investment.\n\nWe can look to other jurisdictions for prospective solutions. In the United States, the Centre for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed a rule that would require 80% of home care provider funding be allocated toward direct care worker pay. Compare that to B.C., where health authorities budget $38 to deliver an hour of care, but the median salary for home care providers on Indeed.com is only $23.40, (61% of the total).\n\nTo reduce that overhead, B.C. home care providers (both public and private) will need to embrace technology that allows providers to be allocated efficiently and effectively and keeps those providers accountable to their patients (and patients' families) for the care they deliver.\n\nWithout that, spending more money risks only delivering more bloat and overhead.\n\nBritish Columbians deserve better care at home, and one way to achieve this is by ensuring that our home care is delivered efficiently and that home care providers are compensated well, commensurate with the care they deliver. The current system of home support has failed to deliver that and is leading to adverse outcomes for British Columbians as we struggle to achieve health care for all.\n\nDr. Kevin Wade is the chief medical officer at Gravitii.care.

This shift represents a significant opportunity to revolutionize the delivery of health care services in the state, bringing tangible benefits to providers and patients.\n\nFor providers, the transition to managed care offers a pathway to greater sustainability in an increasingly complex health care landscape. Medicaid reimbursement rates have long been a point of contention, often falling short of covering the actual cost of care. Managed care presents an opportunity to negotiate more favorable reimbursement agreements, ensuring that providers receive fair compensation for their services. Moreover, select providers assisting with Oklahoma's transition to managed care will receive a temporary increase of 19% in the base fee schedule and an additional 9-10% increase to participate in the state Health Information Exchange (HIE).\n\nMore: Preventive care is not just an option; it's a necessity for a thriving society\n\nPatients, too, stand to benefit significantly from Oklahoma Medicaid's transition to managed care. One of the most compelling advantages is the expansion of rewards and benefits offered to members. For example, some managed care plans provide online mental health coaching, credit for opioid alternatives, such as acupuncture and yoga, rewards for attending mental health appointments following hospitalization, and support for teens experiencing loneliness and social isolation. Since managed care emphasizes preventive care and early intervention, patients are better positioned to manage chronic conditions and avoid costly hospitalizations and emergency room visits. By focusing on proactive, preventive measures, managed care can improve health outcomes, enhance quality of life and reduce health care costs in the long run.\n\nIn Oklahoma, rural communities face significant challenges in accessing health care services, including provider shortages and limited resources. Managed care can address these disparities by creating financial incentives and implementing innovative solutions, such as telehealth initiatives, to bridge the gap between patients and providers. By increasing access to a broader range of services, managed care ensures that all Oklahomans, regardless of location or socioeconomic status, can receive the care they need when they need it.\n\nCritics of Oklahoma's managed care initiative have expressed concerns about the increased administrative burden, the ongoing financial toll of the transition, and a fear of providers exiting the Medicaid network. These concerns are real, but assistance is available.\n\nThe Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) and provider relations teams at the Managed Care Organizations (MCO) have responded quickly to our concerns. Financial programs exist to minimize the economic impact on organizations, but providers must initiate the dialogue. Our experience operating in other states with managed care, such as Colorado, provides optimism through this transition. We find managed care to have fewer silos, less administrative burden and greater financial opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, Oklahoma Medicaid's transition to managed care holds immense promise for providers and patients alike. By fostering greater stability, efficiency and collaboration within the health care system, managed care can transform health care service delivery and improve health outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries across the state. As we embark on this journey towards a more patient-centered, value-based health care system, let us embrace the opportunities managed care presents and work together to build a healthier future for all Oklahomans.\n\nRon Lobato is the chief executive officer of Alliance Mental Health, an outpatient mental health agency operating in Oklahoma and Colorado.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Managed care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preventive healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loneliness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acupuncture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social isolation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomic status"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Healthcare_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Healthcare Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-oklahoman/702c8264fe9aa667240229d5374d846c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.7647058823529411, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

You open an app, order some groceries to pick-up on your way back to the rental. Thinking about the rental reminds you to pay-off the remaining balance on the credit card you used to book the trip, all before you leave the comforts of your umbrella-covered towel.\n\nWhat if healthcare were this easy?\n\nAs president and CEO of a large integrated healthcare system, it's a vision that I've imagined for a long time.\n\nWe need to think differently about how we're serving patients and how to meet the modern expectation of convenience in all things. The good news is this vision is closer than it's ever been.\n\nWe learned two important insights during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) a lot of people prefer virtual care and 2) innovation can happen really quickly when we need it to. Quite honestly, we didn't really know the extent to which these were true before the pandemic.\n\nWhen COVID hit, our organization trained some 2,000 clinicians on video visits in one week. While virtual care peaked during the height of COVID-19, roughly 15% of the care we provide is still delivered virtually. And in some specialty care settings, like mental health, that percentage is closer to 60%.\n\nThe challenge is how do we make sure virtual and in-person services work together to truly deliver a more convenient, connected and personal experience.\n\nIt's the idea behind a new model that we're implementing called Hybrid Care. To start, we're using it for preventive care.\n\nAn expectation of convenience, whether it's retail or health care\n\nThink of Hybrid Preventive Care like shopping at Target. With Target, you can shop online, receive recommendations based on what the retailer knows about you, and then you can pick up your order at whatever location is most convenient.\n\nWith Hybrid Preventive Care, you do your annual preventive assessment online at whatever time works for your schedule, receive personalized recommendations, and get labs, imaging or vaccines at whatever location is most convenient.\n\nPatients who have HealthPartners insurance will be directed to other relevant resources available through their health plan, too. We know increased personalization has a direct impact on outcomes. Through other work we're doing to personalize health information, we know that it can improve vaccination rates, certain cancer screenings and reduce cancellation of some appointments.\n\nThis personalized hybrid experience is starting to meet consumers' desire for simpler health care. It also has potential to bridge the gap that exists between virtual and in-person services. These gaps, by the way, are prompting consumers to shop for services more than they ever have before. According to a study by the data firm Trilliant, individuals are using more than four health care brands on average per year, which has implications for effective care coordination.\n\nIt's a trend that employers are watching, too. Survey data from the Business Group on Health show employers are concerned that virtual health care is siloed and there's a lack of coordination between virtual and in-person services. They're increasingly worried about the fragmented, piecemeal care their employees are receiving.\n\nThese market insights remind us that we need to think differently about how we deliver care and serve consumers and employer groups.\n\nA better-connected experience is better for patients and employers. A true win-win.\n\nHybrid preventive care also happens to benefit our care teams. In a post-pandemic world, a smaller health care workforce is caring for a growing number of patients. And, in spite of record levels of investment, the workforce pipeline continues to flow at a trickle, creating access issues across virtually every specialty.\n\nIn primary care, we have roughly 40 percent more demand than capacity. Wait times for primary care appointments are roughly 24 days. This new model of care provides an efficient approach to lower acuity visits and frees up clinicians' schedules for more complex visits.\n\nBehind the scenes of our innovative mindset\n\nOur care teams already see the potential benefits of this more efficient model and they're excited about reimagining how care can better meet the needs of patients and members. We're building hybrid models for acne, back pain and other areas. We hope to make them available by the end of the year.\n\nThis ambitious timeline is a result of human-centered, iterative design principles that allow us to innovate more quickly. It's a design philosophy that's more common in tech than health care, and it allows us to build on other innovation started at HealthPartners, such as Virtuwell.\n\nVirtuwell is the online diagnosis and treatment service we launched in 2010. At the time, we were trying to disrupt convenience care - and not without criticism. Some experts and patients balked at the initial list of conditions we treated, saying that the limited treatments would require them to go into a clinic even after using our new online clinic.\n\nSince those early days, we've delivered more than a million treatment plans virtually, roughly half of which occurred since 2019.\n\nHybrid care uses this time-tested approach to gathering info from patients and getting that info to clinicians.\n\nBut, rather than using our Virtuwell platform to help patients heal after they've become sick, we've layered on algorithms and processes to support patients for planned, preventive care - to help them stay well.\n\nThe Hybrid Preventive Care experience is based on guidelines from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, United States Preventive Services Task Force, existing patient data in the health record, claims and other information that we have about their insurance plan. Scheduling for labs, preventive screenings or other areas of in-person care is built into the experience. What once was a siloed, separate experience is now a bridge to our comprehensive suite of services. Virtual and in-person teams are better aligned and communicate more effectively behind the scenes, giving consumers a simpler, more personalized way to engage with healthcare.\n\nIt won't be for everyone, of course. Those who have complex care needs, medication refills, or other more urgent symptoms might require traditional care models. But, for us, Hybrid Care is the future. It's a different way of thinking. It's a better way to meet our patients and members' expectations. And, it's what's going to help us make health care simpler and more affordable.", "source": {"uri": "beckershospitalreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hospital Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preventive healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthPartners", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HealthPartners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_&_Medicaid_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Preventive Services Task Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Back pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Under this agreement, Maryland is the only state in the nation that sets hospital rates for services, as regulated by the Health Service Cost Review Commission (HSCRC), so everyone pays the same rate for the same service.\n\nEach Maryland hospital has a specific number of certified beds and receives a set amount of funding based on that bed count, not the number of patients admitted for treatment. Carroll Hospital is certified for 166 beds.\n\nWhen the hospital has more than 166 admitted patients -- a frequent reality since COVID-19 -- it is obligated to provide medical services to those extra patients, but is not reimbursed for them. In Maryland, more inpatients do not provide hospitals with more revenue.\n\nWhile Carroll Hospital averaged around 76% capacity pre-COVID, during, and since COVID, the hospital is usually about 90% capacity or higher.\n\nWhen a hospital is full or near capacity, the emergency department gets backed up with patients who need to be admitted, even if the hospital does not have an appropriate bed available.\n\nThese patients are called \"boarders\" and are in emergency department beds that could be used for patients in the waiting room. During busy times, Carroll Hospital could have more than 20 boarders waiting for a bed to become available.\n\nWe need more hospital beds in Maryland and throughout America. As was pointed out by Roberts, while the population in Maryland has increased, \"the number of hospital beds in Maryland declined from 12,000 to 11,300 from 2015 to 2021.\" Maryland has the fifth-lowest number of hospital beds in the nation (1.82 per 1,000 people), below the 2.38 beds per 1,000 people nationally.\n\nA second issue related to overcrowded hospitals backing up patients in emergency departments is the lack of discharge placements for patients, the amount of time it takes to find a placement and the time it takes for insurance companies to approve the recommended placement. Meanwhile, hospitals are required to hold patients until an appropriate placement is found.\n\nThe average hospital stay for patients at Carroll Hospital is just over four days, slightly less than the Maryland average. But discharges could happen quicker if hospitals had more options for patients who can't go home because they can't take care of themselves and don't have the resources to pay for private home care (about $30 per hour).\n\nMeanwhile, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers and other discharge options for patients are also operating at or near capacity. Thus, many patients are sitting in hospital beds waiting for a placement to become available or waiting -- sometimes for days -- for their insurance company to approve the identified placement. A friend recently spent six extra days in the hospital waiting for her insurance company to approve her placement into a rehabilitation center.\n\nIt would be helpful if government regulators limited the time insurance companies are allowed to approve post-hospital placements. Currently, they are allowed up to 14 days. This is unnecessary and is causing significant backups and wait times in hospitals.\n\nAlso, many of Maryland's non-profit nursing homes are being purchased by for-profit, national chains. These businesses are more selective in the patients they accept, making it more difficult to find placements for more challenging patients. We need more alternative placements for patients, especially the elderly.\n\nAt Carroll Hospital, administrators are doing their best to keep patients moving forward from the time they walk into the emergency department to the time they are discharged or admitted. Last year, the waiting room received a significant renovation to improve patient experience.\n\nThis year, the board approved about $9 million to renovate the emergency department to improve the flow of patients and improve their overall experience. These renovations will be completed in 2028.\n\nLifeBridge Health recently purchased several Express Care sites to give patients additional options for emergency care. By taking advantage of these options, patients will help reduce the overcrowding in emergency departments.\n\nA good question frequently asked is why our emergency departments and hospitals are more crowded today compared with the past. There are many variables contributing to this. As previously stated, we have a growing population without a correlational increase in hospital beds.\n\nIn addition, doctors are reporting that patients are sicker because worsening weight and dietary issues are causing more cases of diabetes, heart attacks and other related conditions leading to more hospitalizations.\n\nAlso, many Americans don't take advantage of free basic health care precautions. For example, more than 90% of patients admitted to Carroll Hospital for COVID infections are unvaccinated and most patients admitted for complications related to the flu have not received a flu vaccine. These are preventable hospitalizations.\n\nAnother significant issue is a provider shortage across America, especially in rural settings, meaning fewer doctors, nurses and other providers to care for an increasingly older and sicker population. Because of these shortages, people must wait longer to secure a doctor's appointment and, sometimes, seek emergency care instead.\n\nThrough better pay and other incentives we need to encourage medical students to select a career in primary care and family medicine instead of specialties that pay significantly more.\n\nLifeBridge Health and Carroll Hospital have partnered with Carroll Community College, McDaniel College and other educational institutions to graduate more healthcare providers. These institutions have invested millions of dollars in infrastructure and new academic programs to help with provider shortages in Carroll County and beyond.\n\nThere are no short-term solutions to this multi-layered challenge. However, America has finally started to address these issues. Healthcare systems are thinking of more efficient healthcare delivery models that provide non-hospital-centered care. These include additional telehealth opportunities and the expansion of community-based, preventative care services that reduce emergency room visits.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_zirpoli@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Tom Zirpoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carroll Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Medicare_&_Medicaid_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LifeBridge_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LifeBridge Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_County,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carroll County, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carroll County, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical medicine and rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preventive healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Services/Online_Health_Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Health/Services/Online Health Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/01/4AWZYNUPFFHXDLQ5I5E7EFLXDA.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Hospitals are adjusting their operating models as a result.\n\n\"The healthcare system all over our country has traditionally built its processes around those that provide the care,\" Peter Banko, president and CEO of Baystate Health in Springfield, Mass., told Becker's. \"That doesn't work anymore for our consumers in what has become a consumer- and digital-centric world.\"\n\nMcKinsey's consumer Health Insights Survey found 45% of consumers are researching providers and in-network costs before choosing a health plan, and 44% are doing similar research before making an appointment. Patients are researching two to three providers before making a decision, prioritizing high-quality organizations and good reviews from other patients. The report noted clinicians with 50-plus reviews are more attractive to patients, and nearly half of patients focus on quality ratings when making their decisions.\n\nAvailability and proximity to the patient are also important. Patients don't want to wait for care and are likely to search for other options if they can't schedule an appointment in a timely fashion. Around 45% of appointments are now booked 24 to 72 hours in advance, according to the McKinsey report, and independent medical groups are able to accommodate that 28% of the time while health systems accommodate three-day availability 17% of the time.\n\n\"If you want to win in any market, be the first to tackle (and start fixing) consumer access,\" said Mr. Banko. \"Over the last year, we started a transformational journey to become a more consumer-driven system.\"\n\nBaystate's emergency department teams redesigned processes to reduce the number of patients who left without being seen to less than 1%. The health system built LinkED to support caregivers while they developed a one-call system to connect patients in the ED with appointments to visit physicians, get images and other follow-up care.\n\n\"Surgeons crafted policies and system to impact OR throughput, start times, turnover times, block scheduling and overall efficiency,\" said Mr. Banko. \"Multidisciplinary care teams, spearheaded by hospitalists, designed standardized work for care management to improve quality, safety, service, length of stay, and transitions outside of acute care. There was great work around scheduling in the patient enterprise and in the transfer center for access to tertiary centers.\"\n\nUVA Health in Charlottesville, Va., is also undergoing a big transformation with a focus on access. The health system's 10-year One Future Together strategic plan centers around providing a united and best in class experience for patients throughout their care journey and increasing access to care with the \"One Team\" initiative.\n\n\"UVA Health has seen tremendous progress since the One Team launch, creating up to a 30% increase in available patient appointments, which, when this work is complete, will mean tens of thousands of new patient visits annually for UVA Health,\" K. Craig Kent, MD, CEO of UVA Health and executive vice president of health affairs at University of Virginia, told Becker's. \"This growth will occur without the expansion of staff or facilities, and with some increase in the number of providers.\"\n\nThe health system is also actively measuring patient experience data, and validated improvements from the 83rd percentile to the 88th percentile by making it easier to schedule appointments. More than 80% of patients now say they are able to schedule appointments during the first call.\n\n\"We expect the transformational One Team work will continue to pay dividends for patients and team members alike as it continues to roll out across our remaining clinics,\" said Dr. Kent.\n\nAccess has also been a key priority for Chapel Hill, N.C.-based UNC Health. Ashley Arey, vice president of care access, leads a team responsible for blueprinting initiatives to \"revolutionize\" the access experience for patients and care teams, she told Becker's.\n\n\"The engagement was successful, yielding several robust initiatives inducing expanding and integrating access centers for a unified, consistent scheduling experience, and expanding online scheduling across specialties, putting more self-service options into the hands of our patients,\" she said. \"Equally important to our 'front door' access experience was to develop strategies that support improved capacity management.\"\n\nThe capacity management initiatives at UNC Health include improving referral pathways and tools, using analytics to elevate capacity gaps, and strengthening virtual care strategies so patients can access care at their convenience.\n\nThe executives featured in this article are among the 400+ speakers at the Becker's CEO+CFO Roundtable Nov. 11-14 in Chicago.

There she is tasked with designing oncology delivery systems for both virtual and in-person care models.\n\nRariy is board certified in internal medicine and endocrinology, and is fellowship trained in clinical research at Harvard Medical School's Brigham & Women's Hospital and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with a medical degree from Harvard.\n\nShe serves on several non-profit and private boards that support the advancement of digital health, technology and equity, and is an advisory council member at the American Telemedicine Association.\n\nPreviously, she led clinical strategy at Amazon Care and served as vice president for enterprise virtual health at Cancer Treatment Centers of America (now City of Hope), where she led the team into digital health adoption in oncology.\n\nHealthcare IT News spoke with Rariy to discuss how she has designed and used virtual care models for oncology systems, where the integration of AI comes in, the overarching strategy of digital transformation, and the kinds of emerging technologies she is using to create better care journeys for the cancer patients Oncology Care Partners treats.\n\nQ. You have designed virtual care models for oncology systems. Please talk a bit about how you went about designing them, and how you've used them in patient care.\n\nA. Designing virtual care models for oncology systems requires a comprehensive approach that combines patient-centric care principles with cutting-edge technology. Initially, we embarked on an in-depth analysis of the existing landscape, delving into patient journeys and care gaps, treatment protocols, and healthcare provider and care team workflows.\n\nCollaborating closely with patients, oncologists, nurses and technology experts, we pinpoint key pain points and opportunities for innovation. This process ensures our virtual care models are tailored to the unique needs of oncology patients, addressing challenges such as transportation barriers, symptom management and psychosocial support.\n\nOnce the design phase is complete, we focus on seamless integration and implementation of these virtual care models into clinical practice. This involves rigorous testing, iterations and collaboration to ensure efficiency, security and user-friendliness.\n\nOur virtual oncology systems facilitate remote consultations, real-time symptom monitoring and access to educational resources, empowering patients to actively engage in their care journey. By fostering stronger connections between patients and their healthcare teams, we aim to improve treatment adherence, enhance quality of life, and, ultimately, achieve better clinical outcomes.\n\nIn patient care, these virtual care models serve as a lifeline for oncology patients, creating an ability to obtain psychosocial support. Patients can conveniently access their care teams for symptom management, participation in care planning and timely psychosocial support, addressing barriers to care all from the comfort of home.\n\nFurthermore, our virtual platforms facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare providers, ensuring comprehensive and coordinated care delivery. By leveraging technology to bridge gaps in care, we strive to revolutionize oncology care, making it more accessible, efficient and patient-centered.\n\nQ. Where are you integrating artificial intelligence into the practice of oncology, and how does the AI work to improve care?\n\nA. Clinical decision support systems powered by AI analyze patient data, including medical history, genetic information and treatment outcomes, to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThese tools assist oncologists in navigating complex decision-making processes by offering insights into optimal treatment pathways tailored to individual patient profiles. By synthesizing vast amounts of clinical and genomic data, AI can identify patterns and correlations that may not be apparent to human clinicians, leading to more accurate diagnoses, treatment selection and prognostic assessments.\n\nBy leveraging patient engagement tools that are AI-driven and individualized, we are transforming the way oncology care is delivered by dynamically adjusting interventions based on patient responses. This patient-centered approach fosters greater engagement and empowerment, enabling patients to play an active role in their care.\n\nQ. How are you using the strategy of digital transformation to enhance oncology care?\n\nA. Digital transformation in oncology is not solely about harnessing technology to enhance care; it also entails adopting human-centered design principles. Oncology practices can enhance efficiency, communication and patient satisfaction, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals affected by cancer.\n\nBy prioritizing the needs and experiences of patients and healthcare providers, digital transformation aims to streamline processes, facilitate communication and empower patients in their care journey. Furthermore, digital transformation facilitates patient enablement and empowerment by providing patients with greater access to information and resources.\n\nQ. What kinds of emerging technologies are you using to create better care journeys for the cancer patients Oncology Care Partners treats? And how are you deploying them?\n\nA. Oncology Care Partners is leveraging a variety of emerging technologies to create better care journeys for cancer patients. Moreover, digital innovations like telemedicine platforms and remote monitoring solutions broaden the scope of oncology care, extending support beyond conventional clinic environments and allowing patients to receive continuous support regardless of their location throughout their wellness journey.\n\nTelemedicine platforms enable convenient virtual consultations, reducing barriers to accessing specialized care and empowering patients to actively participate in their treatment plans. Remote monitoring solutions allow patients to track their symptoms and even vital signs from home, fostering a sense of control and engagement in their care. We couple that with escalations to multidisciplinary care teams to ensure proactive, timely intervention.\n\nAdditionally, through the implementation of unique electronic health record systems, for instance, oncologists gain access to comprehensive patient data, enabling more informed decision-making and seamless care coordination. Clinical decision support tools are available at the point of care.\n\nWe also leverage interoperable technology features and care platforms into our care delivery model, we aim to improve care coordination, enhance communication among healthcare providers, and ultimately provide cancer patients with more personalized and integrated care experiences.", "source": {"uri": "healthcareitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healthcare IT News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_siwicki@healthcareitnews.com", "name": "Bill Siwicki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychosocial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_decision_support_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical decision support system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Medical School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fellow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endocrinology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh_Medical_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health/Home_Care", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health/Home Care", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Caregiver_Support", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Caregiver Support", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/hitn/files/050824%20QandA%20Chevon%20Rariy%201200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Beyond being health care providers, nurses embody the essence of compassion, advocacy and expertise. They are heroes whose contributions resonate far beyond the confines of hospital walls.\n\nThey are not just caregivers; they are companions on the arduous journey of illness, offering solace and support when it's needed most. In moments of vulnerability, it's often the gentle reassurance of a nurse that brings comfort and hope to patients and their families. In this role, nurses serve as a beacon of empathy, providing not just medical care but also emotional sustenance.\n\nNurses serve as invaluable liaisons between patients, families and the broader health care team. They bridge the gap between complex medical jargon and everyday understanding, helping patients to make informed decisions about their health. Through clear communication and advocacy, nurses ensure that patients receive the personalized care they deserve. Whether it's coordinating treatment plans, advocating for patient rights or providing vital education, nurses are the linchpins of effective health care delivery.\n\nIn the intricacy of individualized health care, nurses act as threads binding it all together. They possess a unique ability to see patients not merely as cases but as individuals with distinct needs and preferences. By tailoring care plans to suit each patient's unique circumstances, nurses uphold the fundamental principle of patient-centered care.\n\n\"Nurses are the lifeline and lifeblood of our Stony Brook Medicine health care system,\" said Carol Gomes, chief executive officer, Stony Brook University Hospital. \"They provide exceptional and compassionate care for our patients. I'm so grateful and proud of their dedication and commitment to quality care. We celebrate our team during Nurses Week and applaud their talents every day of the year.\"\n\nAs we honor National Nurses Week, let us not only acknowledge the tireless dedication and sacrifices of nurses but also advocate for the recognition and support they truly deserve. Let us continue to invest in their professional development, provide them with the resources they need to thrive and ensure their voices are heard in shaping health care policies. Because a health care system that truly prioritizes the well-being of its citizens is one that honors and uplifts its nursing workforce.", "source": {"uri": "tbrnewsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TBR News Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compassion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caregiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jargon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stony Brook University Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stony Brook University"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://tbrnewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/doctor-5187733_640-e1715276447212.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "dateEnd": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 111, "textEnd": 122}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Based on their results, they identified four significant obstacles to eye care: cost and insurance, transportation and accessibility, eye health literacy and communication.\n\nOne cross-sectional survey found that 78% of participants cited high medical costs or lack of insurance as an issue. While many patients had insurance or financial insistence, high out-of-pocket costs including copays, co-insurance and deductibles made access to eye care cost-prohibitive. Furthermore, the costs of materials like spectacle lenses, contact lenses and medications had a negative impact on compliance. A survey conducted in Oregon found that fear of surprise costs was a concern for 31% of patients surveyed.\n\nPatients of lower socioeconomic status or those using state or federal health insurance were more likely to have difficulties scheduling appointments.\n\nA study in Alabama found that accessibility and transportation were the biggest perceived barrier to eye care for both patients and providers, citing the need for family members to take time off work to provide transportation and inconvenient locations of eye clinics. Even people in urban communities had difficulties with transportation, despite more transportation options, with 14% of individuals surveyed in Philadelphia citing inability to get transportation and 3.5% citing cost of transportation as barriers to follow-up care.\n\nInability to understand and interpret health information was also a major barrier, with many patients perceiving vision changes as normal. Some studies indicated that while gaps in knowledge played a significant role in people not seeking proper eye care, a need to prioritize more practical considerations may be a more significant issue.\n\nFor example, one study found that although most patients knew diabetes could affect their vision, many did not receive care. Another survey indicated that because the diabetes disease burden is significant, patients are likely to prioritize systemic management over ocular management.\n\nFurthermore, knowledge gaps also were present among eye care providers, with many unaware of the criteria to refer patients for specialty low-vision services.\n\nOne survey found that patients cited difficulty understanding their condition as an issue, with many expressing that their doctors spent inadequate time discussing their diagnosis. One study of ophthalmologists, who were filmed educating patients on drop compliance and glaucoma, found that the ophthalmologists talked for 70% of the discussion and only detected 27% of noncompliance with eye-drop usage.\n\nWhile solutions to these barriers have traditionally focused on increased patient education, these attempts have not always improved follow-up care. However, telemedicine has shown promise in helping eliminate barriers. One study found that 78% of patients reported having a regular relationship with an eye care professional after receiving recommendations based on imaging performed at an emergency room visit for other conditions.\n\n\"Many of these factors are influenced by low socioeconomic status and racial and ethnic inequalities within the United States,\" Green and colleagues wrote. \"However, emphasis should be placed on addressing the practical issues surrounding eye care service access to have the most impact.\"", "source": {"uri": "healio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optometry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Literature review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PubMed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Southeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nova Southeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Systematic review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-pocket_expense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out-of-pocket expense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copayment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copayment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deductible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contact lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomic status"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_care_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eye care professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patient education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/optometry/misc/stock-images/woman-getting-a-ride.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542482", "eventUri": "eng-9542482", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

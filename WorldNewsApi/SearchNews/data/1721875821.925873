{"id": 239751742, "title": "Cycling father, 49, dubbed the 'El Chapo of the Cotswolds' faces drugs trial in the US over...", "text": "An enthusiastic cyclist dubbed the 'El Chapo of the Cotswolds' could be put on trial in the US over an alleged \u00a35 million drugs ring. Matthew Grimm, 49, was arrested just under two years ago after being accused of importing controlled drugs into the country and laundering the profits, thought to be more than \u00a35 million in cryptocurrencies. The National Crime Agency (NCA), which is also known as Britain's FBI, carried out a raid on behalf of the US in November 2022, with the then Home Secretary Suella Braverman later approving his extradition to the country. The father-of-two had appealed against the decision, but this has since been thrown out by High Court judge Mr Justice Fordham, according to The Mirror. It means that Grimm now faces being flown to the US within 28 days to be put on trial and if convicted he could be sentenced to up to 120 years in prison. It was the extent of Grimm's alleged earnings that brought him to the attention of the U.S. authorities. He is the subject of what is known as an Executive Order, signed by President Joe Biden two years ago, granting the White House powers to combat the synthetic drugs epidemic without recourse to Congress. At around 8am on the day of his arrest, 40 police officers dressed in black, many of them armed, descended on the quiet cul-de-sac where Grimm lives in a large, impressive, detached house. 'They sealed off the main road and moved in, some in vehicles, some on foot,' said one local who watched, aghast, as it all unfolded. 'I could hear them yelling outside [Grimm's] front door: 'We are the National Crime Agency. Open the door.' There was no response so they smashed the front door in. It only took a second, then dozens of officers went into the house. Two officers with massive machine guns stayed either side of the door outside. 'They parked a couple of big vans in the driveway and spent two days loading it up with whatever they could find inside.' Until his arrest, Grimm's chief claim to 'fame' had been recording a personal best of ten miles in 23 minutes and 50 seconds in local time trials in July 2022, an achievement proudly listed on his profile on his local cycle club's website. Grimm denies any wrongdoing. Parked on his driveway last November was a Tesla car and a top-of-the-range Audi (both vehicles are worth in the region of up to \u00a360,000 each). On Facebook, Grimm is pictured frequently holidaying on the sun-kissed white sands of the Maldives and Corfu with a female companion. He was labelled the 'El Chapo of the Cotswolds' by a Sunday newspaper in the wake of the 'revelations'. Obviously, he bears no resemblance to Mexican cartel boss Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman who is serving life. Nevertheless, the charges he is facing \u2014 five counts of trafficking and one of money-laundering \u2014 carry sentences of up to 120 years in prison. One of the designer drugs the Gloucestershire businessman is accused of selling in the U.S. is eutylone, which mimics the euphoric effects of MDMA (ecstasy) and cocaine. The downside is that users can also suffer increased heart rate and blood pressure, anxiety and paranoia. In 2020 and 2021, eutylone \u2014 street name 'molly' \u2014 was the most widespread synthetic stimulant found in the U.S. In 2020 alone, there were 343 eutylone-related deaths and 182 (53 per cent) were in Florida, which also accounted for more than two-thirds of eutylone arrests. Florida is also the state where the indictment against Matthew Grimm was filed. Who could have imagined the trail would eventually end 4,000 miles away back in Chipping Sodbury with armed police arriving at his front door? The last time Chipping Sodbury was in the headlines was in May last year when eight squad cars, blue lights flashing, were scrambled to round up a herd of cows causing havoc in the town centre. Grimm himself is from a thoroughly respectable background. His father is a retired heating engineer; his sister, a vet. He also has two young children who live with his ex-partner. Over the past decade, he has set up a string of companies, including one incorporated to sell handbags and another to sell ornaments wholesale. Around 2012, he opened a shop in Bristol, now called Good Timez Reloaded, where you can buy gothic clothing, model skulls, crystals and a range of silver jewellery (decorated with more crystals). Also on sale are cannabis accessories \u2014 but not cannabis itself \u2014 such as bongs, pipes and rolling paper. It is the kind of establishment that was once called a 'head shop', which sold so-called 'legal highs' (typically, a few molecules were changed in the lab to avoid them being classed as illegal) that first rose to prominence in 2009. They remained legal until 2016 when the Psychoactive Substances Act placed a blanket ban on their production and trade after scores of fatalities associated with the craze, including many ordinary middle-class children, who would gather in car parks, bus depots and underpasses to take 'legal highs'. While the Act broadly achieved its objective, it also drove some of the trade underground and on to the internet, according to David Raynes, a former HM Customs investigation officer and a member of the International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy. Grimm then went on to found an online portal called Smokeys Chem Site, now at the centre of the U.S. prosecution. 'We are proud to announce the release of a new range of high-quality products as we aim to help the scientific community in the research development process,' he declared in a PR release for the website in 2016. Many such sites contain riders like this and the label 'not for human consumption'. But in June 2023, a five-star review of the website read: 'I gotta say, Smokeys Chem Site is the real deal when it comes to chems. The quality is top-notch, no doubt about it. And let me tell ya, their delivery game is on point too. 'I'm on the west coast of the U.S. and, usually, my package arrives within two to three weeks. Not too shabby, right?' Either way, according to the U.S. indictment, synthetic drugs such as the previously mentioned eutylone were banned in the U.S. when they were allegedly sold through Smokeys Chem Site between February 6, 2020, and November 1, 2021. Originally, the overwhelming majority of such 'products' were manufactured in China. They have now been outlawed in China too so production has reportedly switched to India. Eutylone was not the only banned substance allegedly available on Smokeys Chem Site. A second drug sold to the American market by Grimm, prosecutors claim, was metahedrone dubbed the 'party drug of the moment' by The Face magazine after it surfaced in clubs in London and Berlin recently and, to quote the author of the article, 'feels like halfway between ecstasy and coke but lasts a lot longer'. Matthew Grimm had an alleged accomplice in the U.S. who cuts an equally unlikely figure to be cast in such a role. She is Carrie-Ann Tooley, in her early 50s, a mother of two from Maine, whose association with Grimm is said to have begun in 2015. Her Facebook page, where she can be seen smiling with her children and her husband and posing in fancy dress for Halloween, gives no indication of the serious crimes she is accused of committing. There is only one possible clue about why she might have become involved with Grimm as the authorities claim. 'Working remotely online I have become skilled in crypto/digital asset trading,' she reveals in one post. Grimm, it is claimed, received payment in Bitcoins, the world's first and largest digital currency. Back in 2010, shortly after the currency was launched, a single Bitcoin was worth just seven pence. Today, the value has soared to an astonishing \u00a323,000. In one of Grimm's virtual 'wallets', investigators say they found 20 Bitcoins, now worth around \u00a3457,000. The two largest wallets are said to be worth \u00a31.1 million and \u00a31.6 million. In all, The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), part of the U.S. Treasury department, netted more than \u00a35 million, it is alleged. Criminals use cryptocurrencies instead of the formal banking system to move large sums of money because virtual assets are harder to detect by law enforcement. Outside the Chipping Sodbury cycle club, Grimm appears to mix rarely with locals. At the nearest pub, 150 yards from his home, staff couldn't recall ever seeing him. A neighbour said he was aware of the moves to have him extradited but declined to comment. Grimm turned up on his bike in full Lycra to answer bail at the police station in Chipping Sodbury last year. 'Let them bring it on,' he told reporters bullishly as he arrived. 'These are just allegations, so I don't want to say anything.' In court papers, his lawyer said his client denies any wrongdoing and is worried that the extradition would distance him from his two children, aged nine and 12, who live with their mother.", "summary": "Matthew Grimm,\u00a049, was arrested just under two years ago after being accused\u00a0of importing controlled drugs into the country and laundering the profits.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13559167/Cycling-father-El-Chapo-Cotswolds-drugs-trial-US.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/09/22/77628049-0-image-m-118_1699569149956.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:13:14", "author": "Dan Woodland,Editor", "authors": ["Dan Woodland", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.17}

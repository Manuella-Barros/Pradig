It didn't win any awards, but it did win over the hearts of many Sundance viewers as one of the best of the fest (I wrote a glowing review). Inspired by a real-life experience of Margolin's own grandmother, Thelma puts a clever spin on movies like Mission: Impossible, shining the spotlight on an elderly grandmother as an unlikely action hero. Yes, she kicks some serious ass. With infectious humor, Margolin employs the familiar tropes of the action genre in hilarious, age-appropriate ways to tackle aging with agency. In the first leading film role of her 70-year career, June Squibb plays Thelma with grit and determination, demonstrating that she is more than capable of taking care of business. In addition to Squibb kicking butt as Thelma, this also stars Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg, Malcolm McDowell, along with the late Richard Roundtree (RIP) as her sidekick. Great trailer that really captures the vibe of the movie!! Don't miss this.\n\nThelma is a poignant action-comedy that gives veteran Oscar nominee June Squibb her first leading role and features the final performance of trailblazing actor Richard Roundtree. Squibb, who did most of her own stunts in the film, plays Thelma Post, a feisty 93-year-old grandmother who gets conned by a phone scammer pretending to be her grandson (Fred Hechinger) and sets out on a treacherous quest across Los Angeles, accompanied by an aging friend (Roundtree) and his motorized scooter, to reclaim what was taken from her. Thelma is written and directed by American actor / producer / editor / filmmaker Josh Margolin, making his feature directorial debut after one other short previously, and plenty of other film industry work. Produced by Chris Kaye, Benjamin Simpson, Karl Spoerri, Viviana Vezzani, Zo\u00eb Worth, and Nicholas Weinstock. This initially premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year (read our review).

Thelma is a light comedy that cleverly embraces the action genre, delivering real tension and excitement in its final third, defying expectations. Squibb and Margolin successfully navigate the fine line between parody and genuine action film, making Thelma a delightful and unique viewing experience.\n\nThroughout her distinguished career, Oscar-nominee June Squibb has taken on a variety of roles in both film and television, including her Academy Award-nominated performance in Nebraska, her role on Shameless, and voice work in Ralph Breaks the Internet and Toy Story 4. This year, Squibb shines as the leading lady for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival in Josh Margolin's action-comedy, Thelma, the latest trailer for which has just dropped.\n\nIn Thelma, 93-year-old Thelma (played by Squibb) has successfully avoided being placed in assisted living by her daughter Gail (Parker Posey) and son-in-law Alan (Clark Gregg). However, when a phone scammer claims her grandson Daniel (Fred Hechinger) has been injured and needs money, Thelma is duped into sending $10,000. Frustrated by her family's assumption that she might need to be placed in a group home, Thelma decides to take control of the situation. She embarks on a daring city-wide adventure that would impress even Tom Cruise with her reluctant friend Ben (Richard Roundtree), aiming to retrieve her stolen money and prove her independence. With her worried family in pursuit, Thelma's quest turns into a thrilling escapade that tests her wits and resolve.\n\nIs 'Thelma' Worth Watching?\n\nCollider's Ross Bonaime was delighted by Squibb's performance, and thoroughly enjoyed his experience of watching the movie.\n\nIn some ways, Thelma is a parody of the action film, as Thelma gets the idea to go on her mission from Mission: Impossible , but Margolin makes the smart decision to also just make this a strong action film in its own right. Especially in the final third, as Thelma's journey comes to an end, Margolin manages to bring a very real tension and excitement to how this could potentially end. It's, of course, naturally silly that June Squibb is starring in her own action adventure, and that plays to the parody aspect, but Squibb and Margolin truly sell making this a genre film in its own right.\n\nThelma is the definition of a light comedy, but Squibb and Margolin's handling of this pseudo-spy parody makes it a delight. Thelma knows not to make fun of its concept, but rather, embrace the possibilities within limitations, in a role that finally gives Squibb her first starring role. In her nineties, Squibb proves that she can be an effective action star and a great lead -- hopefully, this won't be the last time we get to see her front-and-center.\n\nThelma will open in theatres on June 21.

But after she sends in the money, she discovers that her grandson is actually safe, and she has been scammed out of her money.\n\nAngered at being taken advantage of and not trusting the police, Thelma swipes a gun and heads off on a scooter through L.A. to get her money back with the help of her friend, Ben, played by the late Richard Roundtree in the final role of his career.\n\nMagnolia's official logline reads: \"Inspired by a real-life experience of Margolin's own grandmother, 'Thelma' puts a clever spin on movies like 'Mission: Impossible,' shining the spotlight on an elderly grandmother as an unlikely action hero. With infectious humor, Margolin employs the familiar tropes of the action genre in hilarious, age-appropriate ways to tackle aging with agency.\n\n\"In the first leading film role of her 70-year career, Squibb portrays the strong-willed Thelma with grit and determination, demonstrating that she is more than capable of taking care of business - despite what her daughter Gail, son-in-law Alan, or grandson Danny might believe.\"\n\nWritten and directed by first-time filmmaker Josh Margolin, \"Thelma\" also stars Fred Hechinger, Clark Gregg, Parker Posey and Malcolm McDowell.

Serving as the feature directorial debut of Josh Margolin, the big hook here is that Oscar-nominee June Squibb (\"Nebraska,\" \"In & Out\") is getting to lead a revenge thriller at the age of 94. More than that, it marks the first time that Squibb has been given a leading role in a movie in her long, storied career. Check the trailer out for yourself above.\n\nThe trailer is impossibly charming, even though there is an insidious plot at the center of it all. Squibb's character gets scammed out of a bunch of money and, with no options left, she sets out on a path of revenge. It's not unrealistically action-packed or anything like that, but it comes off as quite delightful. Squibb is paired with the late Richard Roundtree, best known for his work on \"Shaft.\" This marks his final film role, adding another must-see layer to the proceedings. The synopsis for the film reads as follows:\n\nSquibb, who did most of her own stunts in the film, plays Thelma Post, a feisty 93-year-old grandmother who gets conned by a phone scammer pretending to be her grandson (Fred Hechinger) and sets out on a treacherous quest across Los Angeles, accompanied by an aging friend (Roundtree) and his motorized scooter, to reclaim what was taken from her.\n\nThe film was inspired by a real-life experience of Margolin's own grandmother, with the producers promising a \"clever spin on movies like 'Mission: Impossible.'\" /Film's Ben Pearson called \"Thelma\" a \"sweet, charming, and uplifting\" movie in his review out of Sundance, adding that it \"is a joy to watch.\"", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Squibb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "June Squibb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnolia Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaft_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaft (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Roundtree", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Roundtree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Pearson_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Pearson (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/june-squibb-is-on-a-mission-in-the-trailer-for-thelma-one-of-sundance-2024s-best-movies/l-intro-1715288007.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554809", "eventUri": "eng-9554809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

But June Squibb might have set a new standard when she took on the lead role in \"Thelma\" and did the bulk of her own stunt work at the age of 93.\n\nJosh Margolin's directorial debut, which is loosely based on a true story about his own grandmother, stars Squibb as a nonagenarian who falls victim to a phone scammer pretending to be her grandson. The injustice inspires her to hop on her motorized scooter and travel across Los Angeles to take down the thief and reclaim her lost funds. The result is an action movie that promises to show audiences that it's never too late to reclaim agency over your own life.\n\nIn addition to Squibb, \"Thelma\" also features \"Shaft\" star Richard Roundtree in his final film performance. Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg, and Malcolm McDowell round out the supporting cast.\n\n\"Thelma\" premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, where many critics praised Squibb's willingness to embody her first leading role with so much life.\n\n\"Margolin and Squibb deftly explore that surprisingly complicated emotional tension, bringing to life a woman not yet ready to debate every tactical move she makes with the cadre back at headquarters. Simultaneously fragile and fearsome, the 94-year-old actress (she's had a birthday since filming!) remains as enchanting and spunky as she was in 2013's 'Nebraska,'\" IndieWire's Alison Foreman wrote in her Sundance review of the film. \"Her chemistry with Roundtree is platonic but contagious, and while your take on the scene in question might vary, there is a read of this film that sees Squibb getting seriously flirty with Malcolm McDowell, whose role is a surprise.\"\n\nDuring a visit to the IndieWire Studio at Sundance, Margolis spoke to IndieWire's Brian Welk about being pleasantly surprised by Squibb's willingness to perform her own stunts as the shoot progressed.\n\n\"At the beginning of the process, I wanted there to be a sense of reality, but we had a stunt team and we were gonna try to be creative about it,\" Margolis said. \"But as the shoot went on, June wanted to do more and more of these stunts. Little by little, we started figuring out where that line was and trusting her to do more and more. And she ended up doing quite a bit of it by the end. She kept setting the tone of being a pro, and I think it brought out the best in everyone.\"\n\nMagnolia Pictures will release \"Thelma\" in theaters on Friday, June 21.

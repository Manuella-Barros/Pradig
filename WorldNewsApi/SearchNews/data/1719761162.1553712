[+] ships while in port. getty Cruise travel is one of the most exciting ways to see the world. It offers a blend of luxury and convenience, allowing curious travelers to visit multiple destinations without the hassle of constant packing and unpacking. As the floating hotel transits from one port to another, guests get the chance to experience diverse cultures, stunning landscapes, and a variety of activities. However, despite the allure of new destinations, many passengers choose to stay on board while the ship is docked. This may be a surprise to those new to cruising, yet this seemingly counterintuitive decision is actually driven by several compelling reasons. Staying on board can offer peace and quiet, access to ship amenities without crowds, special deals, and a relaxing environment\u2014all while avoiding the potential hassles and costs of shore excursions. When The Ship Is The Vacation Traditionally, and in many cases still today, cruises are all about the destinations. However, the newest megaships rival the biggest land-based resorts for amenities, and as such have become destinations in themselves. Royal Caribbean\u2019s Icon of the Seas sold out its first voyage within 24 hours, with passengers keen to experience all that the world\u2019s biggest cruise ship had to offer.

Pools, spas, and lounges are always less busy on port days. The same is true for the headline attractions on newer, bigger ships, such as flowriders, rope courses, and slides. Many ships these days offer exclusive areas or private retreats at an additional cost. However, cruise ships are usually quiet enough on port days to get a similar feel from the regular pool decks. If the goal of your cruise vacation is to relax and unwind, this could be an ideal solution without spending extra cash. Onboard Deals Take advantage of special onboard deals that are often available while the ship is docked. Spas and specialty restaurants often offer discounts and promotions to encourage passengers to stay on board. This can be a perfect time to pamper yourself with a spa treatment, or indulge in gourmet dining. Just bear in mind that onboard shops are usually closed when ships are in dock, so souvenir hunters may still need to head ashore. The same is true for casinos. Check the daily planner, usually left in your stateroom while you\u2019re out for dinner, for any relevant offers for the following port day. Repeat Or Inconvenient Ports Perhaps you've visited a specific port before, and there's nothing new you wish to see. Alternatively, the ship might be docked a considerable distance from the main attractions, making it less convenient to explore. Examples on popular European or Mediterranean cruises include Le Havre, which is often advertised as Paris despite requiring a coach transfer taking more than two hours. Le Havre itself is nothing special, and may require a shuttle bus depending on the berth. Several unappealing ports are now used by major cruise lines in place of Venice. If you\u2019ve been to Venice before or don\u2019t fancy sitting on a coach for several hours, staying on the ship may be preferable. In some cases, ports require tendering, which involves waiting in (often long) queues to board small boats that ferry passengers to shore. Cruise lines don\u2019t always advertise tender ports in advance, but you can often discover any potential tender ports by checking the cruise calls calendar on the websites of the local port authorities. Alternatively, if the ship docks downtown, guests could choose to leave the ship as soon as it\u2019s cleared for a quick look around, then return to the ship early and still enjoy a few hours of peace and quiet. There are no rules. Ultimately cruise travelers are free to decide their own course of action, whether that means spending every possible moment ashore or treating the ship as the destination.

(\"TILT\" or the \"Company\") (Cboe: TILT) (OTCQB: TLLTF), a global provider of cannabis business solutions including inhalation technologies, cultivation, manufacturing, processing, brand development and retail, announced today that an experienced retailer and operator (the \"Lender\") will lend capital to TILT's Pennsylvania subsidiary, Standard Farms (\"Standard Farms\") in order for Standard Farms to construct and operate dispensaries under Pennsylvania's Senate Bill 773. Under the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's (the \"Commonwealth\") Medical Marijuana Program, independent cultivators can apply for one permit that will allow for three dispensary locations.\n\n\"We applaud the Commonwealth for providing a positive path forward for a small independent grower like TILT's Standard Farms to compete in this vibrant marketplace,\" stated TILT Chief Executive Officer, Tim Conder. \"We are thrilled to have reached an agreement with an experienced retailer and operator to help fund this undertaking and provide construction and operational guidance along the way to ensure our success.\"\n\nStandard Farms has been a grower and processor in the Pennsylvania market since 2019 and provides its own Standard Farms house brand and brand partner products such as Old Pal and Level to the majority of dispensaries across the state.\n\nUnder the terms of a Secured Promissory Note (the \"Note\"), Standard Farms can borrow up to $10,500,000. Proceeds from the Note will be used to construct dispensaries obtained via a permit issued from the Department of Health, Bureau of Medical Marijuana, of the Commonwealth. Standard Farms permit will allow the construction and operation of up to three (3) medical marijuana dispensaries in the Commonwealth (collectively, the \"Retail Locations\"). Proceeds from the Note will also be utilized for the initial setup and operation of the Retail Locations.\n\nThe Note will mature on December 31, 2027, and will initially bear interest at 20%. The interest rate will automatically increase to 30% upon Standard Farm's opening a Retail Location and completing a first commercial sale in the Commonwealth (\"Location Opening Date\"). The interest rate will automatically increase to 40% six months after the Location Opening Date. No principal or interest payments will be due under the Note before the maturity date, and the Note may not be prepaid in cash or kind without Lender's prior written consent.\n\nBecause the capital is to fund the construction and operation of the new dispensaries, the Note is secured by a first priority security interest in the retail assets of Standard Farms (the \"Borrower Collateral\"), and a second priority security interest in the equity interests of Standard Farms that are held by the Company's subsidiary Baker Technologies, Inc. (the \"Baker Collateral\"). The Lender entered into a Consent, Collateral Release and Subordination Agreement with TILT's existing creditors to subordinate the Lender's interest in the Baker Collateral and release the existing creditors' interest in the Borrower Collateral. The Lender's security interest is further described in in a Security Agreement, dated May 2, 2024, by and among Standard Farms, the Lender and Baker Technologies, Inc. (the \"Security Agreement\").\n\nThe Note and the Security Agreement include usual and customary loan provisions including: affirmative and negative covenants, events of default, representations and warranties. In the case of an event of default under the Note, Standard Farms may become obligated to pay a multiplied balance of up to four times the then-outstanding obligations under the Note, all obligations under the Note may be accelerated and all remedies may be exercised by Lender. All obligations under the Note are guaranteed by the Company, which guarantee shall terminate if and when a first priority security interest in the properly held retail assets of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Farms is activated. In order to provide collateral free from prior liens, under the terms of the loan documents, Lender will have a first-priority security interest in the equity interests of any such wholly-owned subsidiary that may be held by Standard Farms.\n\nAbout TILT\n\nTILT helps cannabis businesses build brands.

These funds are earmarked for constructing dispensaries authorized by a Department of Health permit.\n\nThe funding also supports the initial setup and operations at these locations. The move comes under Senate Bill 773, allowing Standard Farms to build and operate three new dispensaries as part of Pennsylvania's Medical Marijuana Program.\n\nInterest rates on the note start at 20% and escalate to 40% six months after the first commercial sale from any of the new locations, reflecting the risk and potential growth anticipated from this venture.\n\nThe loan is secured by first-priority security interest in Standard Farms' retail assets and second-priority in the equity interests of Baker Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of TILT.\n\nA security agreement outlines additional terms including covenants and event of default clauses, which, if triggered, could escalate the payable balance up to four times the outstanding obligations.\n\nWhat is PA's potential? In the first quarter of 2024, the cannabis market in exhibited resilience and growth despite a general downturn in the sector across several other states.\n\nPennsylvania reported a 3% increase in cannabis sales, standing out as one of the few states to show positive momentum amid broader market struggles. This growth indicates a robust market environment capable of sustaining and expanding its cannabis operations even when other regions are facing declines.\n\nThe state's market dynamics reflect a stable demand and effective market penetration, which might attract further investments and expansion by multi-state operators (MSOs) looking for promising opportunities in a generally challenging economic landscape for cannabis.\n\nScanning through cannabis spreadsheets can take some time.

(OTC: TLLTF) has secured a financing arrangement with an experienced retail operator for its subsidiary, Standard Farms, to expand in Pennsylvania.\n\nSince 2019, Standard Farms has established a strong presence in Pennsylvania, providing products to most state dispensaries.\n\n\"We applaud the Commonwealth for providing a positive path forward for a small independent grower like TILT's Standard Farms to compete in this vibrant marketplace,\" said Tilt CEO Tim Conder.\n\nThis strategic funding will enhance TILT's market position significantly, leveraging its existing infrastructure and market knowledge to optimize the new operations.\n\nFinancial Terms And Strategy Under the terms of the secured promissory note, Standard Farms is eligible to borrow up to $10.5 million. These funds are earmarked for constructing dispensaries authorized by a Department of Health permit.\n\nThe funding also supports the initial setup and operations at these locations. The move comes under Senate Bill 773, allowing Standard Farms to build and operate three new dispensaries as part of Pennsylvania's Medical Marijuana Program.\n\nInterest rates on the note start at 20% and escalate to 40% six months after the first commercial sale from any of the new locations, reflecting the risk and potential growth anticipated from this venture.\n\nSecurity And Loan Agreements The loan is secured by first-priority security interest in Standard Farms' retail assets and second-priority in the equity interests of Baker Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of TILT.\n\nA security agreement outlines additional terms including covenants and event of default clauses, which, if triggered, could escalate the payable balance up to four times the outstanding obligations.\n\nWhy Pennsylvania? What is PA's potential? In the first quarter of 2024, the cannabis market in exhibited resilience and growth despite a general downturn in the sector across several other states.\n\nPennsylvania reported a 3% increase in cannabis sales, standing out as one of the few states to show positive momentum amid broader market struggles. This growth indicates a robust market environment capable of sustaining and expanding its cannabis operations even when other regions are facing declines.\n\nThe state's market dynamics reflect a stable demand and effective market penetration, which might attract further investments and expansion by multi-state operators (MSOs) looking for promising opportunities in a generally challenging economic landscape for cannabis.\n\nScanning through cannabis spreadsheets can take some time.

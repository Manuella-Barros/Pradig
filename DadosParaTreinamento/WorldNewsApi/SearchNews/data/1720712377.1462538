I'm not convinced I really sound like that but my wife Clare says it is spot on.\" Michael and his wife Clare, a former GP who lived in Buckinghamshire, had recently wrapped up their national tour, titled Eat (Better), Sleep (well), Live (longer).

The couple, who shared a strong bond for 44 years, first met as young medical students at the Royal Free Hospital Medical School, which is now part of the esteemed University College London (UCL). Michael and Clare were blessed with four children, three sons aged 33, 31, and 29, and a daughter who is 24. Following Michael's passing, Clare released a statement saying: \"I don't know quite where to begin with this. It's devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together.\" \"I am incredibly proud of our children, their resilience and support over the past days. My family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It's clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you.\" \"We're taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn't be easily seen by the extensive search team. Michael was an adventurous man, it's part of what made him so special.\" \"We are so grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi who have worked tirelessly to help find him. Some of these people on the island, who hadn't even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked. We're also very grateful to the press who have dealt with us with great respect. \"I feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends. Most of all, I feel so lucky to have had this life with Michael.

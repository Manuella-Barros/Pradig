Amid the age-old traditions and esteemed academic pursuits, Anna Ng, HR Tech Lead at NUS HR Department, spearheaded a transformative journey set to redefine the university\u2019s HR technology landscape. Reflecting on the challenges of the old HR system, Ng vividly remembered the cumbersome processes that once defined NUS\u2019 HR operations. Thousands of transactions were handled manually each year, significantly impacting efficiency and leaving room for error. The reliance on physical files and documents posed security risks and hindered service delivery. \u201cThe traditional approach was no longer sustainable, and we knew we needed a change,\u201d she told HRM Magazine Asia. With a clear vision in mind, Ng set out to build a modern HR ecosystem that would empower both employees and HR professionals alike. The cornerstone of this transformation lies in a Cloud-based Human Resource System (CHRS) from SAP SuccessFactors that would revolutionise the way NUS approached HR management. She explained, \u201cCHRS provides a comprehensive suite of modules that support and automate all aspects of the employee lifecycle. Mobile-enabled ESS [Employee Self-Service] and MSS [Manager Self-Service] functions bring greater convenience and efficiency. We use SAP BTP [Business Technology Platform] to custom build new applications specifically tailored for NUS\u2019 business needs, with full integration to CHRS.\u201d \u201cTo support our employees\u2019 physical health and mental wellbeing needs, leading wellbeing applications like Intellect, BenefitsYou and Darwin are adopted and connected to CHRS.\u201d And extending CHRS further, the team strategically expanded CHRS\u2019 capabilities by integrating third-party solutions like DocuSign for e-signatures, OpenText for document management, Cherwell for HR service request tracking, and AI-powered platforms like Impress.ai and JobTech were adopted for intelligent talent sourcing and skill gap identification. As the new HR ecosystem took shape, Ng witnessed the transformative impact it had on NUS\u2019 workforce. Empowered by self-service capabilities and mobile-enabled functionalities, employees gained greater control over their HR needs, and managers had a better purview of their team data to enable resource allocation, targeted coaching, and staff development. She elaborated, \u201cCHRS eliminates the need for HR involvement in everyday data entry tasks. Employees can now update their personal data and contact details, report newborns, update their marital status, request leave online, and submit claims for expenses or medical bills \u2013 all through a secure and user-friendly system. Building upon this foundation of efficiency, the CHRS mobile app empowers employees with even greater flexibility. They can access the system and manage HR matters from anywhere, anytime, including watching an eLearning video on the go.\u201d The impact has been undeniable. Streamlined processes have boosted productivity, reduced workload for HR and employees, and eliminated maintenance costs associated with outdated systems. But for Ng, the journey was far from over.

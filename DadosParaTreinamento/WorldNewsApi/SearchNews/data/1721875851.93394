She has been on two humanitarian service trips to Belize in which she helped to guide other students while they were building an aquaponics system. She volunteers with her youth group as a leader for junior high girls and also with the welcome team and newcomer\u2019s ministry at her church. She currently works as an aquatics instructor for the City of Edmonton. In the fall, she will be attending the University of Alberta to study science, majoring in physics and minoring in chemistry. Her goal is to complete a Bachelor of Education degree and become a high school science and math teacher. Commencement address: As we leave high school, I want to encourage everyone to keep three things in mind: The first is to focus on the present and not to get lost looking into the future. The weird thing about Grade 12 is the whole thing feels like a lead-up to the next year. Whether it be university, college, a gap year, travel, apprenticeships, work or whatever else you may have planned, it is easy to focus on that and miss what is happening around you. I would like to encourage you not to let your plans for the future prevent you from seeing the amazing things happening around you now. While it is important to look forward to where life will take you, don\u2019t get so focused on the future that you miss out on the present. Someone once said, \u201cLive in the moment because you never know if it is going to happen again.\u201d The second piece of encouragement is to allow yourself to find the right path and, if need be, make your own path. Often in high school, it can feel stressful because of the perceived expectation that you should know exactly what your life plan is. However, instead of focusing on simply getting a plan, I would encourage you to take the necessary time to forge a plan that is right for you. Take time to think and pray about it while working through the process of determining what is the right path for you. Finally, whatever you do with your life, do it for the Lord and hold fast to your faith. We have all had the chance to go to school in a Christian community, but in a few short weeks, we will be done with our time at MCS. As we go out, I want to encourage you to continue to hold tight to your faith. Let\u2019s be the generation that counters the statistics on how few will keep our faith and continue to live for God. We are all going down different paths, and if we continue to live for the Lord, imagine the impact we could collectively make. Mathew 5;16 says, \u201cIn the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\u201d Let\u2019s work to make that happen! What is your favourite thing about Edmonton? One of the things I love about Edmonton is the diversity among people. We truly have a beautiful multicultural community that allows us to expand our ideas and develop new perspectives that help us create a better and more adaptable future. Who is your hero? My heroes would be my parents. They have done so much for me in life and are excellent role models for me in my life. My mom is a hard-working, generous and caring person who has shown me how to work hard, love and be more understanding of others. My dad is also a hard-working and dedicated person who has taught me many valuable life skills that can help me and others. They have both given up so much for me and always supported me; I could never have made it this far without them. What is your favourite quote or expression? \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going.\u201d What one word best describes your graduating class? Eccentric We often hear that, as a society, we are more divided than in the past. How can young leaders work to bridge differences between groups? In our current society, we have become polarized and divided; we have formed barriers between groups, opinions, and people that only do us more harm. I believe that as young people, we have the chance to be the catalyst of change and work to bridge the differences between groups by working together to find our commonalities. It can be easy to focus on what divides us that inevitably pushes us apart and creates these walls, but if we choose to focus on what connects us rather than what divides us, we can be drawn together and work as a society to break down these divisive barriers we have built up in the past. I believe that another thing we can do is to make a conscious effort to be more welcoming to others\u2019 opinions. We have to recognize that, inevitably, we will not agree on everything, but we need to allow others to have their own opinions and not feel like we need to tell them that they are wrong for what they believe.

Crosses were carved into the walls of the nave. St Philip's is located in the same compound as the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital.\n\n\"There was no place to admit patients to the departments so we were forced to turn to this place, which is a place for Christians to worship here in Gaza,\" said Doctor Mohammed al-Sheikh.\n\n\"Due to the shortage of supplies we used pews as beds for the patients,\" he added.\n\nThe war began on Oct. 7 when fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed border defences to raid communities in Israel, killing 1,200 people and grabbing about 250 as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael's assault on Gaza in response began the same day with a pounding bombardment that has continued for nine months along with a ground invasion that Palestinian health authorities say has killed more than 38,000 people and injured more than 80,000.\n\nThe high number of injured from the conflict has added to the rampant disease and malnutrition among the 90% of Gaza residents that the U.N. says have been made homeless, putting massive pressure on the enclave's health system.\n\nHowever, Israel's military campaign has put many hospitals and other health facilities out of action, according to the World Health Organisation, and caused major shortages of needed medical supplies.\n\nIsrael denies deliberately targeting health facilities or stopping medical supplies getting into Gaza.\n\n\"In this church, which is no longer a house of worship but has been turned into a nursing facility, we are getting some basic medical services,\" said Abu Mohammed Abu Samra, who was accompanying his sick mother being treated at St. Philip's.\n\n\"It shows the solidarity between Muslims and Christians in northern Gaza,\" he added.\n\nWhile there is a significant Palestinian Christian population in the West Bank, the Christian community is very small in Gaza, which since 2006 has been controlled by the Islamist group Hamas.\n\nOutside St. Philip's, life in Gaza continued, the signs of war damage visible on the busy street as a man cycled past.\n\n(Reporting by Dawoud Abu Alkas;

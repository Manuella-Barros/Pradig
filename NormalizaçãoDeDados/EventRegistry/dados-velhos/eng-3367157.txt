A two-member Bench, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar, slapped the fines after reviewing the recommendations of an expert body, which had inspected the state of waste management by bulk generators, such as hotels, hospitals, colleges, and railway stations. Delhi generates as much as 14,100 metric tonnes of waste every day, as per official reports.\n\nThe Bench was hearing the Almitra Patel matter, regarding implementation of the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2016, and its directions have come after a warning was issued in April.\n\nThe tribunal imposed an environment compensation of Rs 7 lakh each on Taj Palace, Taj Vivanta, and Zorba Entertainment Private Limited in Gurugram. It imposed a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each on Ginger Hotel near New Delhi station, GK Motel Private Limited, Metropolitan Hotel, and the Lalit Hotel. Crowne Plaza in Mayur Vihar has to pay Rs 4.5 lakh, while Holiday Inn and Golden Palms Hotel have to pay Rs 3 lakh each.\n\nThe Bench also ordered all errant hotels to install sewage treatment plants (STPs), if not installed already, and to ensure their operation. Also, they are to install anti-pollution devices within two weeks.\n\nThe NGT had formed an expert committee that comprised representatives from Environment Ministry, Ministry of Urban Development, Director General of Health Services, Medical Council of India, Delhi Development Authority, Central Pollution Control Board, all municipal corporations of Delhi, Railways, and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.\n\nThe expert committee formed sub-committees that inspected establishments across the four municipal corporation limits. The sub-committees found that though the hotels had provided for two-bin system in kitchens, they had failed to provide similar bins in guest rooms.\n\n\"Most hotels are failing in effective segregation of waste in two bins. Every hotel and banquet hall should provide regular training to kitchen and other staffers on segregation of solid waste in separate bins at the point of generation,\" the report stated.\n\nThe NGT had directed the expert committee to inspect all five-star hotels, hospitals with more than 200 beds, cooperative group housing societies with over 300 flats, markets, shopping malls with a built-up area of over 50,000 sqmts, and colleges with hostels accommodating more than 500 students in Delhi.

A three-member bench headed by NGT Chairperson Swatanter Kumar imposed the compensation as it continued hearing on the Almitra Patel matter on countrywide implementation of SWM Rules.\n\nThe penalties were imposed after the NGT reviewed an expert body's recommendations, which had inspected the waste management scenario by bulk generators such as hotels, hospitals, colleges and railway stations.\n\nThe Tribunal imposed compensation of Rs 3 lakh each on Mahagun Hotel, Leela Venture Ltd., Fraser Suites and Royal Plaza. Park Inn Hotel was imposed a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh, and the Radiance Motel and Golden Petal Hotel were imposed Rs 2 lakh each.\n\nThe bench pulled up Radiance Motel after it pleaded that it was not generating much waste. The hotel was asked to install sewage treatment plants and anti-pollution devices. Likewise, all other hotels, too, have been directed to improve the collection, disposal and treatment of waste generated in their premises.\n\nThe hotels were directed to pay 75 per cent of environment compensation to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and 25 per cent to the Central Pollution Control Board, within two weeks.\n\nThe compensation collected from the errant hotels has to be used for improving the Capital's environment, the bench directed. In four weeks, the NGT-appointed expert committee would have to inspect the hotels once again to check the implementation of the Tribunal's orders.\n\nThe expert committees and sub-committees that inspected the hotels had recommended to the NGT that in many of the hotel premises, segregation of waste was not practiced as per SWM Rules, 2016.\n\nThe NGT had directed the expert committee to inspect hospitals which have more than 200 beds, cooperative group housing societies with over 300 flats, shopping malls with built-up area of over 50,000 sq mts, The matter was listed for August 17.

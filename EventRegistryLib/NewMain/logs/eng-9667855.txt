It's all part of a bid to lure back penny-pinching customers who have cut back on fast food after flocking to the Golden Arches in recent years.\n\nOn June 25, McDonald's will kick off a marketing blitz and a new $5 meal deal, raising the stakes of what's shaping up to be an all-out battle among US restaurants desperate to lure back inflation-battered diners.\n\n\"We're committed to winning the value war,\" Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's US, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nLast month, after Bloomberg News reported on McDonald's plans for the $5 promotion, competitors hit back with their own deals -- and insults.\n\nBurger King's US president pledged to roll out its $5 value meal \"before they do,\" alluding to McDonald's in a memo to franchisees. Wendy's Co. pushed out a $3 breakfast offer and took to social media to mock its competitors for copying its ideas. Even Starbucks, known for its pricey Frappuccinos and lattes, said it would offer a $6 breakfast sandwich and coffee combo.\n\nWhen asked about his adversaries' fighting words, Erlinger smiled and said he isn't fixated on the competition.\n\nAs the largest restaurant chain in the US by sales, he said McDonald's size and marketing muscle gives the $130 billion company an edge over smaller rivals and the ability to reduce any hit to franchisee profits. \"Think about our scale,\" he said, noting that the incremental cost of adding fries and a drink to a sandwich was minimal. The $5 deal includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink.\n\nFranchisees, who operate the majority of McDonald's stores, don't all agree with that calculus. Many say they are eager for a value meal that brings customers in the door but have concerns about people trading down from pricier options, like the $9 Big Mac combo.\n\n\"There simply is not enough profit to discount 30% for this model to be sustainable,\" an independent franchisee group said in a message last month to its roughly 1,000 members.\n\nThe company said a local $5 promotion in upstate New York has performed well with lower-income consumers while driving additional sales by wealthier customers who buy more than just the $5 meal deal.\n\nFor McDonald's though, the promotion -- which runs four weeks nationally and longer in markets like Dallas and Las Vegas -- is not just about driving sales. The national campaign is also geared toward dispelling the notion that McDonald's has become too expensive after images of an $18 Big Mac combo meal in Connecticut went viral on social media along with claims that prices have doubled in recent years.\n\nThe company's prices have increased by an average 40% since 2019 to offset rising costs, Erlinger said in a May blog post. He said the $18 price tag is an anomaly found at just one of the company's more than 13,700 locations.\n\nThat's cold comfort to customers like Dylan Covington, 33, who lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and used to eat at McDonald's about once a week. Price hikes have prompted him to cull his McDonald's visits to every two or three months. Instead, he said he heads to a local restaurant where he can get a bigger sandwich for about the same price.\n\n\"McDonald's was always the cheap option,\" Covington said. \"Now it's not even that. I don't see a reason to go there unless I'm craving a Big Mac specifically.\"\n\nConsumer Pullback\n\nAs prices rose around the US, local McDonald's deals just weren't doing enough to lure back customers like Covington. While the economy is still humming along and the unemployment rate remains low, real disposable income growth in the US has stalled. Americans have depleted much of their pandemic savings and debt is starting to pile up. Dining out has decreased and, for many, even fast-food restaurants are increasingly reserved for a special treat.\n\nMcDonald's competitors were early to ramp up their value offers, with Arby's offering a $6 meal deal back in January and White Castle pushing a $5 Bacon Bundle in April. McDonald's sales were initially holding up better than competitors and the company took a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\"It seems like they were caught on their back heels in terms of value,\" said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bank of America.\n\nErlinger said customers are becoming even \"more discerning about where they're spending their dollars.\" So the company decided to pitch a bigger national deal to franchisees, who own and operate 95% of US locations and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns. The operators initially rejected the promotion over profit concerns but eventually came around, encouraged in part by additional funds provided by Coca-Cola Co.\n\nMcDonald's is also dangling additional promotions like free fries in front of customers ordering via the fast-food chain's app, a key part of the company's growth strategy. App users order more often and are more likely to add drinks, desserts and other extras that boost check sizes and drive up sales.\n\nThe $5 meal promotion likely won't provide an instant fix. The company's original dollar menu debuted in 2002, revamping it several times before landing on a $1 to $3 lineup in 2018. Although the value menu eventually drove strong results, the initiative took a while to gain traction, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski told investors in April about the 2018 value menu.\n\nPrice Perception\n\nMcDonald's declined to detail promotional plans beyond this summer, although Erlinger he said it was fair to say the promotion isn't the fast-food chain's last word on value. \"We obviously are going to remain competitive around value and affordability beyond the $5 meal deal.\" Right now, customers aren't looking for new products or creative takes on McDonald's nuggets, burgers or wraps. \"They're asking for value and affordability,\" he said.\n\nFor their part, competitors say they're ready to go to battle with the restaurant industry's heavyweight. Patrick Doyle, chairman of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc., said the increased focus on value could help prop up the entire industry.\n\n\"There's a perception that maybe prices had gotten a little too high,\" Doyle told investors in mid-June. The value talk is \"hopefully going to help the perceptions around the category in general -- get some people open their minds to coming back.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType":

It includes a McDouble cheeseburger or a McChicken sandwich, small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and small soft drink.\n\n\"We heard our fans loud and clear -- they're looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that's exactly what they'll get,\" said Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, in a press release.\n\nWord of McDonald's newest value meal was released last month in the Wall Street Journal, prompting fast food rivals to get a jumpstart on offering similar deals and attract cost-conscious eaters. Burger King, Wendy's and even Starbucks have rolled out meal deals in recent weeks.\n\nThe arrival of the McDonald's meal deal comes at a time when the company is battling the perception that it has become too expensive. That caused Erlinger to put out a rare open letter denouncing \"viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald's has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates.\"\n\n\"The average price of a Big Mac in the US was $4.39 in 2019,\" he wrote. \"Despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That's an increase of 21% (not 100%).\"\n\nOnline, people have been airing their fast food price grievances. But they're not just griping: Customers are pulling back on spending, too. Diners, frustrated by higher prices, are not going out to eat as often and spending less when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and traffic to dip.\n\nIn Thursday's release, McDonald's pointed out that franchisees are also offering deals like a \"buy one, get one\" deal for $1 breakfast sandwiches in Memphis and a double cheeseburger and small fries pairing for $3.50 in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n\"Affordable prices and creating memorable moments are what McDonald's is all about,\" said John Palmaccio, a McDonald's owner and chair of the Operator's National Advertising Fund. \"As small business owners, it's our responsibility to deliver great value to our local communities when they need it most.\"\n\nMcDonald's is expected to release its next earnings report in late July.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It's all part of a bid to lure back penny-pinching customers who have cut back on fast food after flocking to the Golden Arches in recent years.\n\nOn June 25, McDonald's will kick off a marketing blitz and a new $5 meal deal, raising the stakes of what's shaping up to be an all-out battle among US restaurants desperate to lure back inflation-battered diners.\n\n\"We're committed to winning the value war,\" Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's US, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nLast month, after Bloomberg News reported on McDonald's plans for the $5 promotion, competitors hit back with their own deals -- and insults.\n\nBurger King's US president pledged to roll out its $5 value meal \"before they do,\" alluding to McDonald's in a memo to franchisees. Wendy's Co. pushed out a $3 breakfast offer and took to social media to mock its competitors for copying its ideas. Even Starbucks, known for its pricey Frappuccinos and lattes, said it would offer a $6 breakfast sandwich and coffee combo.\n\nWhen asked about his adversaries' fighting words, Erlinger smiled and said he isn't fixated on the competition.\n\nAs the largest restaurant chain in the US by sales, he said McDonald's size and marketing muscle gives the $130 billion company an edge over smaller rivals and the ability to reduce any hit to franchisee profits. \"Think about our scale,\" he said, noting that the incremental cost of adding fries and a drink to a sandwich was minimal. The $5 deal includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink.\n\nFranchisees, who operate the majority of McDonald's stores, don't all agree with that calculus. Many say they are eager for a value meal that brings customers in the door but have concerns about people trading down from pricier options, like the $9 Big Mac combo.\n\n\"There simply is not enough profit to discount 30% for this model to be sustainable,\" an independent franchisee group said in a message last month to its roughly 1,000 members.\n\nThe company said a local $5 promotion in upstate New York has performed well with lower-income consumers while driving additional sales by wealthier customers who buy more than just the $5 meal deal.\n\nFor McDonald's though, the promotion -- which runs four weeks nationally and longer in markets like Dallas and Las Vegas -- is not just about driving sales. The national campaign is also geared toward dispelling the notion that McDonald's has become too expensive after images of an $18 Big Mac combo meal in Connecticut went viral on social media along with claims that prices have doubled in recent years.\n\nThe company's prices have increased by an average 40% since 2019 to offset rising costs, Erlinger said in a May blog post. He said the $18 price tag is an anomaly found at just one of the company's more than 13,700 locations.\n\nThat's cold comfort to customers like Dylan Covington, 33, who lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and used to eat at McDonald's about once a week. Price hikes have prompted him to cull his McDonald's visits to every two or three months. Instead, he said he heads to a local restaurant where he can get a bigger sandwich for about the same price.\n\n\"McDonald's was always the cheap option,\" Covington said. \"Now it's not even that. I don't see a reason to go there unless I'm craving a Big Mac specifically.\"\n\nConsumer Pullback\n\nAs prices rose around the US, local McDonald's deals just weren't doing enough to lure back customers like Covington. While the economy is still humming along and the unemployment rate remains low, real disposable income growth in the US has stalled. Americans have depleted much of their pandemic savings and debt is starting to pile up. Dining out has decreased and, for many, even fast-food restaurants are increasingly reserved for a special treat.\n\nMcDonald's competitors were early to ramp up their value offers, with Arby's offering a $6 meal deal back in January and White Castle pushing a $5 Bacon Bundle in April. McDonald's sales were initially holding up better than competitors and the company took a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\"It seems like they were caught on their back heels in terms of value,\" said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bank of America.\n\nErlinger said customers are becoming even \"more discerning about where they're spending their dollars.\" So the company decided to pitch a bigger national deal to franchisees, who own and operate 95% of US locations and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns. The operators initially rejected the promotion over profit concerns but eventually came around, encouraged in part by additional funds provided by Coca-Cola Co.\n\nMcDonald's is also dangling additional promotions like free fries in front of customers ordering via the fast-food chain's app, a key part of the company's growth strategy. App users order more often and are more likely to add drinks, desserts and other extras that boost check sizes and drive up sales.\n\nThe $5 meal promotion likely won't provide an instant fix. The company's original dollar menu debuted in 2002, revamping it several times before landing on a $1 to $3 lineup in 2018. Although the value menu eventually drove strong results, the initiative took a while to gain traction, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski told investors in April about the 2018 value menu.\n\nPrice Perception\n\nMcDonald's declined to detail promotional plans beyond this summer, although Erlinger he said it was fair to say the promotion isn't the fast-food chain's last word on value. \"We obviously are going to remain competitive around value and affordability beyond the $5 meal deal.\" Right now, customers aren't looking for new products or creative takes on McDonald's nuggets, burgers or wraps. \"They're asking for value and affordability,\" he said.\n\nFor their part, competitors say they're ready to go to battle with the restaurant industry's heavyweight. Patrick Doyle, chairman of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc., said the increased focus on value could help prop up the entire industry.\n\n\"There's a perception that maybe prices had gotten a little too high,\" Doyle told investors in mid-June. The value talk is \"hopefully going to help the perceptions around the category in general -- get some people open their minds to coming back.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It includes a McDouble cheeseburger or a McChicken sandwich, small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and small soft drink.\n\n\"We heard our fans loud and clear -- they're looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that's exactly what they'll get,\" said Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, in a press release.\n\nWord of McDonald's newest value meal was released last month in the Wall Street Journal, prompting fast food rivals to get a jumpstart on offering similar deals and attract cost-conscious eaters. Burger King, Wendy's and even Starbucks have rolled out meal deals in recent weeks.\n\nThe arrival of the McDonald's meal deal comes at a time when the company is battling the perception that it has become too expensive. That caused Erlinger to put out a rare open letter denouncing \"viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald's has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The average price of a Big Mac in the US was $4.39 in 2019,\" he wrote. \"Despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That's an increase of 21% (not 100%).\"\n\nOnline, people have been airing their fast food price grievances. But they're not just griping: Customers are pulling back on spending, too. Diners, frustrated by higher prices, are not going out to eat as often and spending less when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and traffic to dip.\n\nIn Thursday's release, McDonald's pointed out that franchisees are also offering deals like a \"buy one, get one\" deal for $1 breakfast sandwiches in Memphis and a double cheeseburger and small fries pairing for $3.50 in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n\"Affordable prices and creating memorable moments are what McDonald's is all about,\" said John Palmaccio, a McDonald's owner and chair of the Operator's National Advertising Fund. \"As small business owners, it's our responsibility to deliver great value to our local communities when they need it most.\"\n\nMcDonald's is expected to release its next earnings report in late July.\n\nCNN's Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

McDonald's is about to find out.\n\nThe Chicago-based fast-food giant officially kicks off its summertime value push starting next Tuesday, when it will sell its $5 Meal Deal, a combo of a four-piece Chicken McNuggets, small fries, drink and a choice of a McChicken or a McDouble.\n\nThe deal is a reaction to weak traffic in recent quarters, which is largely the result of high prices. McDonald's has raised its prices 40% on average since 2019, itself a reaction to the rising cost of doing business. Costs for the chain's franchisees have increased 40% over that period, too.\n\n\"We heard our fans loud and clear,\" Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, said in a statement. \"They're looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that's exactly what they'll get.\"\n\nMcDonald's has largely kept its value offers out of the spotlight over these past few years, choosing instead to give them to customers who download its app and sign up for its loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards. It also gave local markets the option to introduce their own value offers, based on local demand and prices.\n\nBut those offers don't get the attention that a national value offer does. The company has thus decided that a meal deal, similar to those offered by chains such as Burger King, could help it regain lost customers and shift the conversation back toward fast-food value.\n\nMcDonald's is getting a lot of company in the process. Burger King relaunched its $5 Your Way Meal last week, getting the jump on its longtime rival. Wendy's has started selling a $3 breakfast combo. Jack in the Box, Subway and several other fast-food chains are also offering value deals.\n\nEven Starbucks, which typically avoids the value offer fray, is selling a \"Pairings\" menu that starts at $5.\n\nBut McDonald's also wants to shift some focus toward the offers it does have, which can be plentiful if you know where to look. The company has \"Free Fries Friday\" offering a medium fries with a $1 purchase every Friday through the end of the year. The company will also give away fries on July 13 inside its stores for customers who use the app.\n\nMcDonald's has several other deals on its app, such as 20% off orders of $5 or more in the Minneapolis market.\n\nAnd the company is reminding people of the local offers. Customers in Columbus, Ohio can get a Double Cheeseburger and small fries for $3.50. Customers in Western New York can get a mix-and-match McChicken and McDouble deal for $3.99.\n\n\"As small business owners, it's our responsibility to deliver great value to our local communities when they need it most,\" John Palmaccio, a McDonald's owner and chair of the Operator's National Advertising Fund, or OPNAD, said in a statement.\n\nWhether this effort will reverse McDonald's traffic trends remains to be seen. And the company had to convince franchisees, through OPNAD and other groups, to go along with the $5 offer given concerns about profitability. It wasn't until Coca-Cola chipped in a contribution that it was OK'd.\n\nStill, the $5 value deal is unlikely to be the last such national offer McDonald's pushes.

It will simply charge $1 more in some areas.\n\nThe chain says McDouble meal options may be priced at $6 at certain restaurants in Alaska, California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, Manhattan in New York and Washington.\n\nMcDonald's deal goes on sale on Tuesday, June 25 for a week\n\nRead More McDonald's fans left fuming as new $5 deal comes with a major catch - despite fast food chain's billions in profits\n\nSome fans are also disappointed that the deal will only last for a month rather than all summer - like deals from rivals.\n\nNot only that, McDonald's was beaten by rivals who got value deals out first.\n\nBurger's King's almost identical $5 offer launched last week, while Wendy's and Starbucks rolled out breakfast deals recently too.\n\n'We're committed to winning the value war,' Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's US, said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Thursday.\n\nMcDonald's also brought back app-only \"Free Fries Friday\" that allows customers to snag a free medium fry with any $1 minimum purchase through the end of 2024.\n\nAfter news of McDonald's deal leaked in May, rivals rolled out their offers ahead of it - and even took digs at the home of the Big Mac.\n\nBurger King's boss promised in a letter to franchisees to introduce its $5 value meal 'before they do.'\n\nTrue to his word, the chain's new $5 Your Way Meal landed in restaurants last week.\n\nCustomers get a choice of one of three sandwiches - a Whopper Jr, a Bacon Cheeseburger or Chicken Jr - plus four chicken nuggets, fries and a soft drink.\n\nLaunching a $3 breakfast offer, Wendy's, mocked its competitor on social media for stealing their ideas.\n\nStarbucks also made a surprise entry into the value war with a coffee and food breakfast combo from $5.\n\nIn the interview with Bloomberg, Erlinger said he is focussed on McDonald's rather than its rivals.\n\nHe said that the scale of McDonald's - the latest chain by sales in America - gives it an edge over smaller rivals.\n\n'Think about our scale,' he said, pointing out that adding fries and a drink to a burger was a small cost to the business.\n\nIt is not something that franchisees all agree with. They operate nine out of ten McDonald's and are worried that customers will trade down from a pricier Big Mac meal to the $5 value meal that for many restaurants will make no profit.\n\nMcDonald's made an eye-watering $14.5 billion profit last year.\n\nErlinger wrote an open letter to customers claiming its price rises aren't as bad as some media is reporting\n\nMcDonald's is trying desperately to battle perceptions that it has raised prices so much it is no longer good value.\n\nIn fact, last month Erlinger wrote an unprecedented open letter to customers claiming its price rises aren't as bad as some media is reporting.\n\nIn the letter, he says prices have 'only' gone up 40 percent across its 14,000 US restaurants since before the pandemic.\n\nThe letter was aimed to calm the furore around the soaring cost of fast food - which is now so high that four in five Americans consider it a luxury.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Wendy's announced its $3 limited-time breakfast combo meal and Burger King trumpeted that it planned to bring back its $5 Your Way Meal.\n\nIn addition, fast food mobile apps continue to offer deep discounts.\n\nApp relief\n\nRecently, a Big Mac with medium fries and medium drink cost $11.79 before tax at a McDonald's in Santa Ana. That same meal ordered via a mobile app for pickup at the same location cost $6.50 before tax, a savings of $5.29.\n\nBut the prices and deals tend to vary depending on the user.\n\nThe plethora of promotional deals come after diners blasted fast food companies on social media earlier this year for rising prices.\n\nIn response, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, responded in an open letter last month.\n\n\"Recently, we have seen viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald's has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates. This is inaccurate,\" Erlinger wrote.\n\n\"The average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\" he said. \"Despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That's an increase of 21% (not 100%),\" as unsubstantiated claims allege on social media.\n\nQuick-service restaurants said the increases were in response to rising inflation and labor costs -- partly due to hikes in minimum wage not just in California but throughout the country.\n\nIt's true that quick-service restaurants such as McDonalds have had to contend with increased costs, but they are by no means hurting, said Shubhranshu Singh, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in quick-service marketing.\n\n\"They are not struggling,\" Singh said. \"Inflation is going up. Wage rates are going up. But profit for McDonald's is also going up.\"\n\nGlobal comparable sales for McDonald's grew nearly 2% in the first quarter of the year, according to the latest statistics made available by the company. The fast-food giant described this profit increase as having \"benefited from average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases.\"\n\nPrice-weary diners have taken notice and become fed up with the price hikes, choosing to eat less fast food and protesting on social media that their go-to budget meals were no longer wallet-friendly, Singh said.\n\nSeveral diners took aim at McDonald's, griping on TikTok about the company charging more for food that's supposed to be affordable.\n\n\"This is $3 worth of food,\" said a customer who held up a hash brown. \"Something doesn't seem right here.\"\n\n\"McDonald's has gotten too cocky,\" said another customer. \"Y'all not supposed to be expensive.\"\n\nOne diner called it \"absurd\" that she'd paid $4.59 for a medium order of french fries.\n\nAnd then there was the uproar over a McDonald's location in Connecticut charging $18 for a Big Mac combo meal. The photo sparked a nationwide debate on soaring fast-food prices.\n\nMaking choices\n\nMost McDonald's in the United States are independently franchised, so prices vary depending on where one visits.\n\nIncreased fast food prices ultimately led to slower-than-expected sales at various quick-service restaurants, such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Pizza Hut.\n\n\"Consumers are always making choices,\" said restaurant analyst Sara Senatore at Bank of America. \"When the value proposition starts to diminish, consumers will make other choices.\"\n\nUp until fairly recently, consumers were willing to pay more for quick-service food. When fast food prices started to soar in 2022, consumers just went along because prices everywhere had surged due to inflation, Senatore said.\n\nBut now inflation has lessened. Grocery prices have fallen and budget-conscious consumers may no longer see fast food as the clear-cut affordable choice, she said.\n\nEnter the value meals.\n\nBudget meals aren't new. In the 1980s, McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King engaged in a series of advertising campaigns known as the Burger Wars competing for customers in the then-flourishing fast food market.\n\n\"The hope is that the consumer will go there and maybe buy something additional to the value meal and then want to return even when there is no deal,\" Singh said.\n\nBut the promotions, analysts warned, can't last forever.\n\n\"It's not sustainable,\" Singh said. \"I don't expect any of these deals to stay.\"", "source": {"uri": "oregonlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oregon Live"}, "authors": [],

Customers will get a total of four items - either a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, small soft drink and four McNuggets - when the offer hits restaurants on Tuesday (June 25). It was thought that not every restaurant will offer the deal - with those that have higher labor and rent costs opting out.\n\nBut it has now emerged that McDonald's has a sneaky way around this. It will simply charge $1 more in some areas. The chain says McDouble meal options may be priced at $6 at certain restaurants in Alaska, California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, Manhattan in New York and Washington. Some fans are also disappointed that the deal will only last for a month rather than all summer - like deals from rivals.\n\nNot only that, McDonald's was beaten by rivals who got value deals out first. Burger King's almost identical $5 offer launched last week, while Wendy's and Starbucks rolled out breakfast deals recently too. 'We're committed to winning the value war,' Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's US, said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Thursday.\n\nMcDonald's also brought back app-only \"Free Fries Friday\" that allows customers to snag a free medium fry with any $1 minimum purchase through the end of 2024. After news of McDonald's deal leaked in May, rivals rolled out their offers ahead of it - and even took digs at the home of the Big Mac. Burger King 's boss promised in a letter to franchisees to introduce its $5 value meal ' before they do.'\n\nTrue to his word, the chain's new $5 Your Way Meal landed in restaurants last week. Customers get a choice of one of three sandwiches - a Whopper Jr, a Bacon Cheeseburger or Chicken Jr - plus four chicken nuggets, fries and a soft drink. Launching a $3 breakfast offer, Wendy's, mocked its competitor on social media for stealing their ideas.\n\nStarbucks also made a surprise entry into the value war with a coffee and food breakfast combo from $5. In the interview with Bloomberg, Erlinger said he is focused on McDonald's rather than its rivals. He said that the scale of McDonald's - the latest chain by sales in America - gives it an edge over smaller rivals.\n\n'Think about our scale,' he said, pointing out that adding fries and a drink to a burger was a small cost to the business. It is not something that franchisees all agree with. They operate nine out of ten McDonald's and are worried that customers will trade down from a pricier Big Mac meal to the $5 value meal that for many restaurants will make no profit. McDonald's made an eye-watering $14.5 billion profit last year.\n\nMcDonald's is trying desperately to battle perceptions that it has raised prices so much it is no longer good value. In fact, last month Erlinger wrote an unprecedented open letter to customers claiming its price rises aren't as bad as some media is reporting.\n\nIn the letter, he says prices have 'only' gone up 40 percent across its 14,000 US restaurants since before the pandemic. The letter was aimed to calm the furore around the soaring cost of fast food - which is now so high that four in five Americans consider it a luxury.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

It's all part of a bid to lure back penny-pinching customers who have cut back on fast food after flocking to the Golden Arches in recent years.\n\nOn June 25, McDonald's will kick off a marketing blitz and a new $5 meal deal, raising the stakes of what's shaping up to be an all-out battle among US restaurants desperate to lure back inflation-battered diners.\n\n\"We're committed to winning the value war,\" Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's US, said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nLast month, after Bloomberg News reported on McDonald's plans for the $5 promotion, competitors hit back with their own deals - and insults.\n\nBurger King's US president pledged to roll out its $5 value meal \"before they do,\" alluding to McDonald's in a memo to franchisees. Wendy's Co. pushed out a $3 breakfast offer and took to social media to mock its competitors for copying its ideas. Even Starbucks, known for its pricey Frappuccinos and lattes, said it would offer a $6 breakfast sandwich and coffee combo.\n\nWhen asked about his adversaries' fighting words, Erlinger smiled and said he isn't fixated on the competition.\n\nAs the largest restaurant chain in the US by sales, he said McDonald's size and marketing muscle gives the $130 billion company an edge over smaller rivals and the ability to reduce any hit to franchisee profits. \"Think about our scale,\" he said, noting that the incremental cost of adding fries and a drink to a sandwich was minimal. The $5 deal includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink.\n\nFranchisees, who operate the majority of McDonald's stores, don't all agree with that calculus. Many say they are eager for a value meal that brings customers in the door but have concerns about people trading down from pricier options, like the $9 Big Mac combo.\n\n\"There simply is not enough profit to discount 30% for this model to be sustainable,\" an independent franchisee group said in a message last month to its roughly 1,000 members.\n\nThe company said a local $5 promotion in upstate New York has performed well with lower-income consumers while driving additional sales by wealthier customers who buy more than just the $5 meal deal.\n\nFor McDonald's though, the promotion - which runs four weeks nationally and longer in markets like Dallas and Las Vegas - is not just about driving sales. The national campaign is also geared toward dispelling the notion that McDonald's has become too expensive after images of an $18 Big Mac combo meal in Connecticut went viral on social media along with claims that prices have doubled in recent years.\n\nThe company's prices have increased by an average 40% since 2019 to offset rising costs, Erlinger said in a May blog post. He said the $18 price tag is an anomaly found at just one of the company's more than 13,700 locations.\n\nThat's cold comfort to customers like Dylan Covington, 33, who lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and used to eat at McDonald's about once a week. Price hikes have prompted him to cull his McDonald's visits to every two or three months. Instead, he said he heads to a local restaurant where he can get a bigger sandwich for about the same price.\n\n\"McDonald's was always the cheap option,\" Covington said. \"Now it's not even that. I don't see a reason to go there unless I'm craving a Big Mac specifically.\"\n\nConsumer Pullback\n\nAs prices rose around the US, local McDonald's deals just weren't doing enough to lure back customers like Covington. While the economy is still humming along and the unemployment rate remains low, real disposable income growth in the US has stalled. Americans have depleted much of their pandemic savings and debt is starting to pile up. Dining out has decreased and, for many, even fast-food restaurants are increasingly reserved for a special treat.\n\nMcDonald's competitors were early to ramp up their value offers, with Arby's offering a $6 meal deal back in January and White Castle pushing a $5 Bacon Bundle in April. McDonald's sales were initially holding up better than competitors and the company took a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\"It seems like they were caught on their back heels in terms of value,\" said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bank of America.\n\nErlinger said customers are becoming even \"more discerning about where they're spending their dollars.\" So the company decided to pitch a bigger national deal to franchisees, who own and operate 95% of US locations and get to weigh in on major marketing campaigns. The operators initially rejected the promotion over profit concerns but eventually came around, encouraged in part by additional funds provided by Coca-Cola Co.\n\nMcDonald's is also dangling additional promotions like free fries in front of customers ordering via the fast-food chain's app, a key part of the company's growth strategy. App users order more often and are more likely to add drinks, desserts and other extras that boost check sizes and drive up sales.\n\nThe $5 meal promotion likely won't provide an instant fix. The company's original dollar menu debuted in 2002, revamping it several times before landing on a $1 to $3 lineup in 2018. Although the value menu eventually drove strong results, the initiative took a while to gain traction, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski told investors in April about the 2018 value menu.\n\nPrice Perception\n\nMcDonald's declined to detail promotional plans beyond this summer, although Erlinger he said it was fair to say the promotion isn't the fast-food chain's last word on value. \"We obviously are going to remain competitive around value and affordability beyond the $5 meal deal.\" Right now, customers aren't looking for new products or creative takes on McDonald's nuggets, burgers or wraps. \"They're asking for value and affordability,\" he said.\n\nFor their part, competitors say they're ready to go to battle with the restaurant industry's heavyweight. Patrick Doyle, chairman of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc., said the increased focus on value could help prop up the entire industry.\n\n\"There's a perception that maybe prices had gotten a little too high,\" Doyle told investors in mid-June. The value talk is \"hopefully going to help the perceptions around the category in general - get some people open their minds to coming back.\"", "source": {"uri": "syndication.washingtonpost.com",

The $5 meal includes the customer's choice of a McDouble or McChicken sandwich with small fries, four-piece chicken McNuggets and a soft drink.\n\nThe president of McDonald's USA, Joe Erlinger, said that the chain heard \"fans loud and clear -- they're looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that's exactly what they'll get,\"\n\nEarlier this year, a viral TikTok featuring a McDonald's \"secret dinner box\" sparked demand for deals from the chain.\n\nRelated: McDonald's Clarifies Their Secret 'Dinner Box' with Discounted Menu Items After Mom's Hack Goes Viral\n\nLeiela Kapewa-Latu went viral on TikTok after posting her family's McDonald's \"dinner box\" -- which cost her $12 at a Texas McDonald's.\n\nIn the video, she shared what was included in the bundle box: two cheeseburgers, four small fries, 10-piece chicken nuggets, two Big Macs and sauces.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

We're focused on living up to that legacy.\"\n\nThe deal was pre-announced over a month ago.\n\nThe company also touted deals offered by local franchisees which vary store to store. Some McDonald's in Memphis, Tenn., are offering buy-one-get-one-free breakfast sandwiches and Columbus, Ohio is offering a double cheeseburger and small fries for $3.50. It also reiterated a previously announced promotion where customers can get a free medium fries with a $1 minimum purchase through the end of the year.\n\nMcDonald's has been feeling the pinch of inflation and consumer impressions that the chain has become too expensive. Customers have complained about $8 chicken sandwiches and $18 Big Mac meals, coining the phrase \"McFlation\". McDonald's missed earning expectations for the first time in almost four years in 2023's fourth quarter.\n\nTo counter that, Erlinger took the unusual step last month of issuing a public letter to push back against what he called \"viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald's has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates.\"\n\n\"I can tell you that it frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold - even if it was at one location in the U.S. out of more than 13,700,\" he wrote. \"More worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019. The average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019. Despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29.

We're focused on living up to that legacy and offering delicious, affordable options customers can enjoy any time they walk through our doors, go through our drive thru or place an order through our app.\"\n\nThe chain notes that its $5 Meal Deal isn't the only offer on the table. Other launches include a french fry deal as well as app exclusives from some of its local franchisees.\n\nCustomers nationwide using the McDonald's App can enjoy \"Free Fries Friday\" for the rest of the year by snagging a free medium fry with any $1 minimum purchase until the end of 2024. Additionally, for National French Fry Day (July 13) McDonald's App users can get free fries of any size with no purchase necessary.\n\nMcDonald's says franchisees in communities across the country are celebrating summer by promoting their own special deals on social media. For instance, in Memphis, Tennessee, folks can enjoy $1 breakfast sandwiches with the purchase of another, and customers in Columbus, Ohio, can pair a Double Cheeseburger with a small-size fry for $3.50.\n\nFolks are encouraged to check out the McDonald's App for all the summer deals in their area.\n\nThe house of Ronald McDonald is not the only fast-food chain embroiled (or flame broiled) in the fast food value wars.

With so many prices at an all-time premium, it shouldn't feel like breaking the bank just trying to get a quick meal on the road or at the airport.\n\nAfter an $18 Big Mac meal sparked outrage among its customers, McDonald's is responding by releasing a summer filled with deals. That's right: the value meal we were promised, which caused so many competitors to get their own cheap meals on menus, is finally here.\n\nMcDonald's Introduces $5 Meal Deal\n\nMcDonald's is adding its $5 Meal Deal to menus nationwide on June 25. The long-awaited deal gets you your choice of a McDouble or McChicken, small fries, four-count chicken nuggets, and a small soft drink -- for just $5.\n\nThat's cheaper than combining basically anything on the \"$1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu,\" which hardly has anything for $1 at all.\n\nWith customers complaining about fast food price hikes, it's clear McDonald's is hoping the new deal will have people flocking to the Golden Arches. And while the deal is great -- and you don't have to order online or download the restaurant's app to get it -- there is still a catch. The $5 Meal Deal is only available for a limited time.\n\nWe were hoping Mickey D's would take a page from Wendy's book, which offers $5 Biggie Bags and $4 \"444\" meals all the time. For now, it seems like a limited-time promotion, but maybe if it's a successful deal, McDonald's will consider adding it to the menu full-time.\n\nMcDonald's Free Fries Friday Deal\n\nBut that's not all. We'll happily take a summer filled with deals. McDonald's is also bringing back its \"Free Fries Friday\" deal. Every Friday through the rest of 2024, customers can get a free medium fry with any purchase of $1 or more. However, for this deal, you will need to order via the McDonald's app.\n\nAnd, it's sweetening up National French Fry Day, too, by giving away free any size fries on July 13 with no additional purchase necessary.\n\nMcDonald's Local Promotions\n\nLastly, following the franchise drama in which customers found major price discrepancies between McDonald's locations mere miles apart, the brand has a solution.

A representative for the chain was not immediately available to comment on how long guests can expect the meal to be available.\n\nNews of the $5 Meal Deal broke last month, following McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski's comments during an April earnings call that customers were becoming more \"discriminating\" with their spending.\n\n\"That's not just something that's low income. I think all consumers are looking for good value for good affordability, and so we're focused on that action,\" he said at the time.\n\nSources claiming to know of the company's plans to introduce the $5 meal provided advance details to outlets including Bloomberg and the Associated Press in May, with one claiming the cost would be higher in certain markets. (McDonald's, in Thursday's release, did indeed indicate that prices for the meal could be $6 in Alaska, California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, Washington, and the borough of Manhattan in New York City.)\n\nAlong with news of its $5 Meal Deal, McDonald's also touted its \"Free Fries Friday\" promotion, which offers a free medium order of French fries for customers who spend at least $1 on any other item in the McDonald's app.\n\nThe brand added that local restaurants could be offering their own discounts via the app as well.\n\n\"Value has always been part of our DNA,\" Erlinger said in the press release. \"We're focused on living up to that legacy and offering delicious, affordable options customers can enjoy any time they walk through our doors, go through our Drive Thru or place

Indeed, prices have shot up whopping 28% from 2019 to 2023 due to a variety of factors such as inflation and labor costs. Needless to say, families looking for a quick budget meal haven't been thrilled or have simply had to cut back on drive-thru dinners to save money. Now, McDonald's has responded with some good, affordable news. Starting next week, McDonald's will have a new $5 meal deal on the menu that includes three food items and a drink.\n\n\"We heard our fans loud and clear -- they're looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that's exactly what they'll get,\" Joe Erlinger, President of McDonald's USA, said in a press release. \"Value has always been part of our DNA. We're focused on living up to that legacy and offering delicious, affordable options customers can enjoy any time they walk through our doors, go through our drive thru or place an order through our app.\"\n\nThere had been chatter about this $5 meal deal back in May, but now the details have been confirmed. The new combo meal will be available starting on Thursday, June 25 for a limited time and includes your choice of a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, a four-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink.\n\nYou can also snag an order of fries for free by using the McDonald's app. Every Friday -- aka \"Free Fries Fridays\" -- you can get a free medium order of fries with any purchase of at least $1 on the app.\n\nFor a totally free fries, you'll need to wait until Saturday, July 13. On National French Fry Day, you can get a free order of fries -- small, medium, or large, your choice -- when you order it in the McDonald's app. No purchase is necessary for this promotion next month.\n\nMcDonald's isn't the only fast food chain to respond to customer complaints about affordability. This week, Burger King also announced a new \"$5 Your Way Meal\" that includes your choice between a Whopper Jr., Bacon Cheeseburger, or Chicken Jr. sandwich with fries, a four-piece chicken nuggets, and a soft drink.\n\nWe all have a bit of nostalgia when it comes to fast food, whether we're thinking about those TY Teenie Beanie Babies (that are selling on eBay for $2,000 right now) we got in our Happy Meals or shaking the hell out of a McSalad Shaker (RIP) like the Kardashians do with every salad ever featured on their reality shows. Perhaps the new Inside Out 2 Happy Meal toys will follow a similar path for our kids, but thankfully you won't have to break the bank on a drive-thru dinner to find out.", "source": {"uri": "romper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Romper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French fries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_meal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combination meal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McChicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McChicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_McNuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken McNuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-food_restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast-food restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whopper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whopper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Meal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Happy Meal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_nugget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken nugget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beanie_Babies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beanie Babies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeseburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheeseburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger Relief", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Prepared_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Prepared Meals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Dried_and_Emergency_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Dried and Emergency Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Prepared", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Prepared", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/20/06357c57/1718828693-1d7829b38d2bfcf9c12401417685bd35.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667855", "eventUri": "eng-9667855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 1239, "textEnd": 1246}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1674, "textEnd": 1681}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The meal includes a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink, with some locations pricing the McDouble meal at $6. Not to be outdone, Burger King is mulling a similar $5 'Your Way deal'. Meanwhile, McDonald's reinstated its 'Free Fries Friday' promo via their app, allowing users to grab a free medium fry with any $1 purchase through 2024.\n\nWith disposable income dwindling among lower-income groups and menu prices rising due to higher commodity and supply chain costs, the fast-food sector is feeling the pinch. Promotions like McDonald's $5 meal deal and Burger King's potential cost-friendly offerings are strategies to combat declining sales as customers tighten their belts. Investors should watch how these tactics impact market dynamics and competitor responses in the coming months.\n\nThe bigger picture: Home dining trend reshapes the industry.\n\nMajor retailers like Target, Walmart, and Kroger are playing a pivotal role in the home dining trend by keeping prices on everyday essentials low, further challenging fast-food chains. As customers become more selective with their spending, fast-food giants like McDonald's and Yum Brands are reporting mixed results, with selective promotions fueling sales in some cases.

Riders of all ages were able to enjoy cycling on traffic-free roads through George Square, Merchant City, Trongate and Glasgow Green. The event also included Festival Zones in George Square and Glasgow Green with entertainment from Scotland\u2019s cycle stunt team The Clan, a children\u2019s bike skills track and pedal-powered Scalextric. In Glasgow Green, people were given the chance to try cycle speedway with Glasgow Cyclones and cycling on adaptive bikes with local charity Sunny Cycles. Riders were able to replicate the stars of last year\u2019s UCI Cycling World Championships by taking on the 14% gradient of Montrose Street with individual times being registered by Scottish Cycling. Samantha Allen, Event Lead of Ford RideGlasgow, said: \u201cIt has been an absolute delight to see thousands of people out on traffic-free roads today enjoying Ford RideGlasgow. \u201cWe are very passionate about wanting to inspire more people to cycle more often and we hope by putting on this fantastic event and making it completely free to all, we will have done that today. \u201cThe benefits of cycling are huge, not only from a physical and mental health wellbeing but also for its positive environmental impact as a sustainable method of transport. We would like to thank Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Life for helping us make this happen today.\u201d Fraser Little was one of 26 members of the Glasgow Inclusive Cycling Club which was was created in September last year following the UCI Cycling World Championships. He said: \u201cWe started the Glasgow Inclusive Cycling Club off the back of the UCI Cycling World Championships last September to create a safe space for anyone to come along and cycle. \u201cWe had five members when we started and now we have more than 100 which shows there is a need within Glasgow for an inclusive, safe-space cycling club. \u201cToday has been our biggest turn out for a single event to date with 26 of us here and it has been brilliant. The sun has come out, the atmosphere is fantastic and there is a great mixture of serious cyclists, families and leisure cyclists. It\u2019s just nice to see people cycling in Glasgow away from the usual traffic in the city.\u201d Glasgow Life Head of Events, Julie Pearson, added: \u201cThe incredible success of the UCI Cycling World Championships in Glasgow last summer, which showcased the city\u2019s passion for the sport to a global audience, helped build a lasting legacy that has inspired so many to make cycling part of their lives. \u201cThe development of cycling-related activity in our communities has remained a priority, to encourage and enable more people \u2013 regardless of background, age or ability \u2013 to get on a bike for recreation, sport and travel. And we\u2019re fortunate Glasgow not only boasts a world-class velodrome that can be used by those learning to cycle as well as elite riders, but also has many great community cycling hubs and groups helping overcome barriers and encouraging beginners and experienced cyclists alike. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have hosted the first-ever Ford RideGlasgow FreeCycle as a wonderful celebration of The Power of the Bike, and that so many people participated in what has been a fantastic, free, family-friendly event.\u201d", "summary": "Cyclists enjoyed 5km of traffic-free roads as part of the event.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/west-central/hundreds-of-glasgow-cyclists-enjoy-traffic-free-roads-as-part-of-inaugural-cycling-event", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/34e34d2e781f903dfdeff5432268e9a4-1717948005.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:31:10", "author": "Holly Lennon", "authors": ["Holly Lennon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": 0.657}

The draw ended a run of three consecutive wins for the Danes, who warmed up for Euro 2024 with impressive victories over Scandinavian neighbours Sweden and Norway.\n\nKasper Hjulmand will stick with his favoured back three system for the clash with England and there are familiar faces across the Danish team, with ex-Chelsea centre-back Andreas Christensen, Leicester's Jannick Vestergaard and Crystal Palace defender Joachim Andersen forming the unit ahead of Kasper Schmeichel in goal.\n\nFurther forward, Christian Eriksen will be given a free role behind two forwards and scored in the opener against Slovenia. The 32-year-old - who memorably suffered a cardiac arrest at the European Championship three years ago - is back at full fitness and will be key for Denmark.\n\nHjulmand criticised his team following their draw with Slovenia and has demanded an increase in intensity against England. Denmark have a poor record against the Three Lions with just four wins from 22 games, though three of those have come in the last seven encounters.\n\nEngland opened Euro 2024 with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Serbia. The Three Lions started well to dominate the opening exchanges and took an early lead through Jude Bellingham's brave header. However, Gareth Southgate's side failed to build on their start as Serbia grew into a largely dull contest, that saw four shots on target between the teams.\n\nEngland's five shots were the second-lowest of any team at Euro 2024 in their first fixture and an amassed xG of just 0.52 is a concern. Serbia frustrated England with three central defenders and Denmark are set to operate in a similar system. The task for Southgate will be to ensure his attacking talent is not stifled, with Harry Kane ineffective against Serbia and Phil Foden largely anonymous.\n\nThe roles of Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold in particular have been questioned and it remains to be seen whether the latter keeps his place in the team. Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo are waiting for a chance in central midfield. Elsewhere, Luke Shaw is not expected to be available, denying England again of a recognised left-back.\n\nEngland 2-1 Denmark, AET, 07/07/2021 (Euro 2020 semi-final)\n\nEngland booked their place in the final of a major tournament for the first time in 55 years after beating Denmark in extra time at Wembley.\n\nMikkel Damsgaard's fantastic free-kick fired Denmark ahead after 30 minutes but England bounced back to level just nine minutes later, as Simon Kjaer inadvertently turned Bukayo Saka's cross into his own goal. Kasper Schmeichel kept Denmark in the contest with some stunning saves from Harry Maguire and Harry Kane forcing the semi-final into extra time.\n\nEngland were awarded a penalty in the added period and Kane scored at the second attempt for a 103rd-minute winner, a poor penalty falling kindly back to the Three Lions captain to convert after Schmeichel's save.\n\nDenmark: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Wind, Hojlund.\n\nEngland: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold, Rice; Saka, Bellingham, Foden; Kane.\n\nArtur Soares Dias (Portugal)\n\nDenmark vs England will be shown live on BBC One and iPlayer.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"},

by Denmark in Frankfurt.\n\nyou have updates\n\nEngland missed the chance to book their spot in the last-16 stage of Euro 2024 with a match to spare, as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Denmark in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.\n\nHarry Kane sent Gareth Southgate's ahead in the 18th minute of the contest, but Denmark levelled the scores courtesy of a stunning strike from Morten Hjulmand in the 34th minute.\n\nThe result has left England top of Group C on four points, two points clear of second-placed Denmark and third-placed Slovenia ahead of the final two fixtures in the section.\n\nDespite the disappointment of the result and the performance, Southgate's team are still in a strong position to advance to the knockout round of the competition.\n\nEngland struggle to make their mark against Denmark\n\nEngland were unchanged from their clash against Serbia last time out, which meant another start for Trent Alexander-Arnold in central midfield, with Marc Guehi also keeping his spot in the XI after an excellent performance in his first game at a major tournament.\n\nDenmark's side showed one change from their draw against Slovenia, though, and it came in a wing-back position, with Joakim Maehle replacing Alexander Bah.\n\nManchester United duo Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund both started, while Barcelona's Andreas Christensen was another notable inclusion for the Danes.\n\nDenmark had a half-chance inside the first 30 seconds, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg seeing his effort kept out by England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford after smart work from Hojlund.\n\nKyle Walker turned an ankle for England in the early exchanges, but he was able to continue, which looked unlikely when replays first showed his foot giving way on the turf, which continued to cut up.\n\nPhil Foden had a half-chance in the 13th minute after working his way into a shooting position inside the Denmark box, but he just lifted his effort over the crossbar.\n\nDenmark well worth a point in Group C contest\n\nThe breakthrough came for England in the 18th minute, with Kane sliding the ball into the bottom corner from close range after a horror mistake from Victor Kristiansen, who allowed Walker to break into the Denmark box, and the ball eventually came for Kane, with the Bayern forward, as expected, taking the chance.\n\nDenmark enjoyed a strong spell in the period that followed, with Hojlund just unable to sort out his feet in time inside the England box after a clever flick from his club and international teammate Eriksen.\n\nThe Danes levelled the scores in the 34th minute of the contest, and it was a stunning hit from Morten Hjulmand, with the midfielder, who is believed to be of interest to Manchester United, finding the bottom corner with an effort off the inside of the post.\n\nDenmark were dominant, with Morten Hjulmand having another one deflected wide of the target late in the first period, before Joachim Andersen headed over the crossbar and Hojbjerg tested Pickford, and Kasper Hjulmand's side more than deserved to be level at the half-time interval.\n\nEngland would have been looking for a fast start in the second period, but that was not to be, with Denmark certainly looking the more productive outfit.\n\nBukayo Saka headed into the side-netting after beating Kasper Schmeichel to a bouncing ball, while the Denmark goalkeeper was also needed to keep out a strike from Declan Rice.\n\nEngland made to wait for Euro 2024 last-16 qualification\n\nFoden then struck one off the post, with England looking the more dangerous, and it was Denmark's turn to sit back as the match approached its final 30 minutes of action.\n\nSchmeichel had to be at his best to deny Ollie Watkins in the 72nd minute, with the Aston Villa striker entering the field alongside Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze, which led to Kane, Foden and Saka all departing after finding it difficult to make their mark for long spells.\n\nPickford was then called into action to deny Hojbjerg down the other end, with the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder putting in a strong performance in Frankfurt.\n\nAndreas Christensen headed one over the crossbar for Denmark late on, before Hojbjerg hit one just wide, with England's goal coming under attack in the latter stages of the contest, but neither team could score a second, as the points were shared on Thursday night.\n\nWhen are Denmark, England next in action?\n\nEngland will conclude their Group C campaign against Slovenia on Tuesday, while Denmark will take Serbia on the same night, with all four teams still capable of advancing to the round of 16.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"},

With Serbia and Slovenia's 1-1 draw earlier on Thursday, England knew a win would guarantee passage to the Round of 16.\n\nPhil Foden looked to be England's biggest threat earlier, showing pace and fancy footwork, but his final touch let him down on a number of occasions in the first half. Moments after Foden's best chance of the opening 45, the Three Lions got their goal from Kane.\n\nTaking advantage of Victor Kristiansen's lapse of concentration, Kyle Walker marauded down the right before slotting a ball towards the front of goal. The ball was out of reach of Bukayo Saka, but it fell for Kane and the Bayern Munich star made no mistake.\n\nThe goal was Kane's 64th for his country.\n\nThe marker proved to be a momentum changer, but not in the way England would have hoped. Denmark grew into the half after going behind as England looked disjointed. That became apparent quickly with Hjulmand's equalizer in the 34th.\n\nOff of a throw-in, Kane turned the ball over to Kristiansen who set up Hjulmand outside of the area. The Sporting man unleashed a hard, low drive that hit the inside of the post and went in. While Jordan Pickford saw the ball late. he still had no chance to make a save.\n\nEngland weren't much better to start the second half, but the Three Lions had the best early chance and it was Foden once again. The Manchester City forward almost caught Kasper Schmeichel out in the 55th, but his shot rocketed off of the post and out.\n\nAfter a triple change up front, England claim close again through Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. Played inside behind the Danish backline, Watkins effort was well-saved by Schmeichel.\n\nThe substitutes briefly buoyed England for a spell before Denmark once again came back into the game. In the 83rd, Marc Guehi, who had otherwise been rock-solid, gave up possession to Alexander Bah, but made an exceptional run to get back and dispossess the Benfica defender before he could get a shot off.\n\nMoments later, Denmark came close again after more casual play from England. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg pounced on an errant Jude Bellingham pass in the 85th and sent a fine curling effort that froze Pickford, but just cleared the far post.\n\nThe draw means that England has never won its first two matches at a Euro.\n\nThe result leaves Group C with everything to play for headed into Tuesday's finale.\n\nEngland tops the group on four points, followed by Denmark and Slovenia on two and Serbia bringing up the rear with one. All four teams can still advance to the knockouts.\n\nEngland will play Slovenia, while Denmark takes on Serbia.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Bah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

The match highlighted England's struggles to maintain momentum and defensive solidity, prompting questions about their ability to progress deep into the competition.\n\nWith upcoming challenges against Slovenia and a resurgent Serbia, head coach Gareth Southgate faces the daunting task of reshaping his team's strategy and performance to secure vital points and revive their championship aspirations.\n\nAlso read: Euro 2024: First pic of Mbappe in protective mask after broken nose goes viral, fans dub him 'Captain France'\n\nThe thrilling encounter, played in front of a packed Deutsche Bank Park stadium, began with a balanced exchange of possession, and Denmark had the first significant opportunity. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg fired a shot from outside the box, but it was comfortably saved by England's goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford. The chance came courtesy of a neat setup from Rasmus Hojlund, highlighting Denmark's early intent.\n\nEngland's first clear chance fell to the talented Phil Foden. The Manchester City star received the ball from Kyle Walker, skillfully evaded a Danish defender, but his attempt to curl the ball into the net went high and wide, failing to trouble Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 18th minute for England. A defensive error from Victor Kristiansen allowed Kyle Walker to deliver a low cross into the box. The ball eventually found its way to captain Harry Kane, who made no mistake with a simple finish, giving England a 1-0 lead.\n\nWith this goal, Kane took his total tally for England to 67 and became the third highest goal scorer (5 goals) for the Three Lions in the Euros, just behind legendary Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney.\n\nDespite conceding, Denmark responded impressively. They moved the ball with precision and posed a constant threat whenever they advanced. Their perseverance paid off in the 34th minute when Morten Hjulmand capitalized on a misplaced pass by Kane. The Sporting midfielder unleashed a stunning strike from 25 yards out, beating Pickford and netting his first goal for Denmark, leveling the score at 1-1.\n\nHjulmand's stunning equalizer marked the 13th goal scored from outside the box in this tournament, surpassing the total number of such goals in the entire group stage of Euro 2020 by one. To put that into further context, those 13 goals have been scored in just 17 of the 36 games played before the knockout rounds.\n\nHjulmand's goal, his first for his country, was also the longest-range strike of the competition so far, soaring past Jordan Pickford from 30.9 meters. The last goal scored from a greater distance in the Euros was Mikkel Damsgaard's goal in the 2020 edition semi-final between the same countries at Wembley.\n\nThe Danes continued to press and finished the first half as the stronger side. Hojbjerg and Hojlund combined again, with the former testing Pickford with another shot, but the England keeper was equal to the task.\n\nThe pace of England's play did not lift to start the second half, with the exception of a burst from Trent Alexander-Arnold from midfield, which ultimately led to nothing of note. England struggled to regain their first-half momentum, and Denmark maintained their organized defense.\n\nPhil Foden, having moved off his left wing, nearly put England back in front in the 55th minute. His fierce low drive beat Schmeichel but cruelly struck the post, leaving the scoreline unchanged.\n\nIn a tactical move, Gareth Southgate made key substitutions in the second half, bringing on Eberechi Eze, Ollie Watkins, and Jarrod Bowen for the Manchester City midfielder, Harry Kane, and Bukayo Saka.\n\nAlso read: Euro 2024: Serbia keep hopes alive with Luka Jovic's injury time equaliser against Slovenia, secure 1-1 draw\n\nOllie Watkins nearly made an immediate impact after entering the match, connecting with a precise through ball from Jude Bellingham. However, his attempt was thwarted by Kasper Schmeichel, denying England a late breakthrough.\n\nEngland, however, remained second-best in many aspects, as Hojbjerg once again came close to scoring with a curled effort that Pickford could not have reached.\n\nThe 1-1 draw between England and Denmark at Euro 2024 has left both teams with a crucial point in Group C, shaping the narrative for upcoming matches. England's next challenge will be against Slovenia, while Denmark prepares to face Serbia. Earlier in Munich, Serbia salvaged their Euro 2024 campaign with a late equalizer against Slovenia, securing a 1-1 draw in the clash.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType":

England coach Gareth Southgate removed his forward line in a triple substitution with 25 minutes to play.\n\nDenmark leveled in the 34th when Morten Hjulmand fired in a powerful low shot from long distance, after Kane gave away the ball in defense.\n\nThe Danes made England look ragged in the second half, attacking the end from where English fans' anxiety and jeers increased late in the game.\n\nEngland has four points from two games, after edging past Serbia 1-0 in its first match. That points tally always has been enough to advance in the 24-team Euros format.\n\nStill, England can finish in any position from first to third in the Group C standings after playing unbeaten Slovenia next Tuesday.\n\nSlovenia drew 1-1 with Serbia earlier Thursday, four days after getting the same result against Denmark. Serbia and Denmark also play Tuesday evening.\n\nSouthgate had defended his players from what seemed like unfair criticism for the nervy nature of the win against Serbia, ceding some control after Jude Bellingham's early goal.\n\nBellingham was subdued Thursday and Southgate removed the stellar strike trio of Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka in one sweep. Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Ollie Watkins came on and within two minutes Watkins almost scored with a shot after a darting run.\n\nSouthgate looked flat-out furious in the 85th after England repeatedly gave away the ball and surrendered a series chances to Denmark.\n\nThe England coach barked at his players from the dugout with both index fingers pointing to his temples, urging them to think.\n\nEngland seized the lead on sleepiness in the Denmark defense. Hesitation by Victor Kristiansen let right-back Kyle Walker surge past him to steal the ball for a pass across the goalmouth.\n\nWhen the ball reached Kane he poked home a left-footed shot for a record extending 64th England goal for the captain.\n\nKane had his part in Denmark's leveler. His unwise pass out of defense soon went to Hjulmand, who strode forward to fire a low shot past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and in the net off his right-hand post.\n\nThe game was played beneath a closed stadium roof on slippery turf that cut up after steady rain this week.\n\nThe teams had royal watchers from the stands with the king of Denmark, Frederik X, and future king of England, Prince William, at the game.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

However, it was not quite the perfect comeback for Eriksen, as his opener was cancelled out by a deflected long-range shot from Slovenia's Erik Janza 13 minutes from time, forcing both sides to share the spoils in a 1-1 draw.\n\nDenmark boss Kasper Hjulmand admitted after the match that his side were \"too passive\" and lacked intensity in the closing stages, and he has encouraged his players to maintain their high energy levels for the entire 90 minutes if they wish to claim three precious points from at least one of their remaining two group fixtures.\n\nRanked 21st in the world by FIFA, Denmark have made themselves difficult to beat in recent months as they have only lost one of their last 13 international matches since March 2023, but the draw with Slovenia means they have now won just one of their last six group fixtures at the European Championship (W1 D1 L4).\n\nThe Euro 1992 winners head into Thursday's contest having won just four of their previous 22 meetings with England, and failure to claim maximum points will put them in danger of exiting the group stage at a second consecutive major tournament, after falling at the first hurdle at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nFollowing a memorable debut season at Real Madrid, Jude Bellingham inspired England to an important 1-0 victory over Serbia in their opening Group C match on Sunday, ensuring the Three Lions' quest to banish the demons of Euro 2020 began in positive fashion.\n\nThe floodgates were seemingly primed to open when 20-year-old Bellingham powered home a header from Bukayo Saka's deflected cross in the 13th minute, but England failed to capitalise on their early dominance which led to a nervy second half, as they were forced to soak up pressure from a much-improved Serbian outfit.\n\nNevertheless, Gareth Southgate can take positives from a defensive perspective as his side showed \"resilience\" to quell the threat of Serbia. England eventually held on for maximum points and subsequently sit two points clear of both Denmark and Slovenia, knowing that victory against the former on Thursday will see them qualify for the last 16.\n\nEngland have become the first nation in European Championship history to keep five consecutive clean sheets in the group stage of the competition, while they have not tasted defeat at the group stage since their Euro 2004 opener against France, recording eight wins and four draws since then.\n\nInterestingly, England will be bidding to win their opening two matches at a Euros tournament for the very first time when they face Denmark on Thursday, but success against the Danes is not a given considering they have failed to win any of their previous three competitive meetings in 90 minutes.\n\nDenmark European Championship form:\n\nD\n\nDenmark form (all competitions):\n\nLDWWWD\n\nEngland European Championship form:\n\nW\n\nEngland form (all competitions):\n\nDLDWLW\n\nTeam News\n\nDenmark boss Hjulmand may decide to stick with the same starting lineup on Thursday, with Crystal Palace's Joachim Andersen, former Chelsea man Andreas Christensen - now at Barcelona - and Leicester City's Jannik Vestergaard all retaining their places in a three-man defence, protecting 37-year-old goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nJoakim Maehle will be pushing for a recall at wing-back at the expense of either Alexander Bah or Victor Kristiansen, while Tottenham Hotspur's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is set to links arms with Morten Hjulmand in centre-midfield.\n\nMan United striker Rasmus Hojlund has scored seven goals in 15 international caps for Denmark and is expected to continue up front alongside Wind, with Eriksen operating in the number 10 role.\n\nAs for England, Southgate will weigh up whether to stick with the same starting lineup or look to make one or two changes, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden potentially at risk of dropping down to the substitutes' bench.\n\nAlexander-Arnold began in centre-midfield alongside Declan Rice against Serbia and could keep his spot on Thursday, but it would not come as a surprise to see one of Conor Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo or even Adam Wharton handed a start at the Liverpool man's expense at some point during the group stage.\n\nFoden, meanwhile, struggled to make the desired impact on the left flank. The Manchester City star would prefer to operate centrally or on the right, but both Bellingham and Saka seem nailed in their respective positions, so Foden is seemingly poised to continue on the left, unless Southgate opts for a change in personnel and hands a start to one of Anthony Gordon, Cole Palmer or Eberechi Eze.\n\nDenmark possible starting lineup:\n\nSchmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Wind, Hojlund\n\nEngland possible starting lineup:\n\nPickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold, Rice; Saka, Bellingham, Foden; Kane\n\nWe say: Denmark 0-1 England\n\nThree of the last four meetings between Denmark and England have seen no more than one goal scored, and another tight affair could be on the cards considering the stakes are already high at this early stage in the tournament.\n\nDenmark cannot be written off in Frankfurt and have the attacking players at their disposal to cause England one or two problems, but if the Three Lions can defend with the same resilience that got them over the line versus Serbia and Southgate gets his final-third stars to click, then they should find a way to claim another narrow victory and secure their place in the last 16.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nbody check tags

Denmark was denied by Slovenia's late leveler in a 1-1 draw also on Sunday. They meet in Frankfurt at the Waldstadion where kickoff is at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT). Here's what to know about the match:\n\n-- Denmark's need for a win is greater, ahead of a final Group C game against a physically imposing Serbia team.\n\n-- The teams renew their rivalry from a Euro 2020 semifinal played three years ago at Wembley Stadium. England won 2-1 after extra time, sealed when Harry Kane followed up his penalty being saved by Kasper Schmeichel to score when the ball rebounded to him.\n\n-- Denmark did not easily forget how England got that decisive spot-kick, for a foul awarded against defender Joakim M\u00e6hle -- \"a penalty which should not have been a penalty,\" coach Kasper Hjulmand said then.\n\n-- There is a familiarity between the squads with teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Brentford on either side of this game.\n\n-- Gareth Southgate is coaching England at his fourth tournament and will be less troubled than analysts and fans about the manner of victory over Serbia. England eased its way through the group stage at Euro 2020 -- making at least two changes between each game -- did not concede a goal, then accelerated through the knockout rounds.\n\n-- Southgate's main call could be if Trent Alexander-Arnold's long-range passing is retained in central midfield alongside Declan Rice. Recent debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton are options.\n\n-- England's preferred left back Luke Shaw is still not involved in team training, and Kieran Trippier is set to continue on his less favored flank.\n\n-- Denmark has reported no injury concerns.\n\n-- A draw can be a good result for Denmark even if it ends the day third in the standings. Slovenia plays Serbia in the earlier game Thursday. In two previous Euros with a 24-team tournament format -- which sends four of the six third-place teams to the knockout phase -- a team with three draws has done enough to advance.\n\n-- Another England win would set the team up to win Group C and face a third-place team in the round of 16. The group runner-up will face the Group A winner, likely Germany, in the vibrant Dortmund stadium.\n\n-- However, England has never won two straight games to start a Euros tournament.\n\n-- Defender Simon Kjaer was an unused substitute against Slovenia and his Denmark record of 132 national-team games is now just one ahead of Christian Eriksen, who scored in that 1-1 draw.\n\n-- \"We see it every day in training here, and he's such a nice guy as well. You know he has high standards that he sets and expects.\" -- England midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, 19, on star teammate Jude Bellingham, who turns 21 next week\n\n-- \"Once the tournament starts you get into a rhythm. It came and we won it. So, we're confident now, we're happy.\" -- England winger Bukayo Saka on winning the first game\n\n-- \"We have it in our power to have a fantastic game against England where nobody expects us to win.\" -- Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name":

Denmark took the lead early against Slovenia on a 17th-minute goal from captain Christian Eriksen and the Danes looked the part of heavy favorite for the majority of the game, yet they spurned multiple opportunities to pull away and were stunned by a 77th-minute equalizer en route to a 1-1 draw.\n\nHeading into Thursday's match in Frankfurt (12:00 pm ET), Denmark are sizable underdogs against England, who are +400 co-favorites in the Euro 2024 championship odds alongside France.\n\nEngland vs Denmark Odds\n\nThe England vs Denmark odds list the Three Lions as -150 favorites to win with Denmark at +450 and the draw at +260. The over/under is sitting at 2.5 goals but with the under favored at -150. Over 2.5 is currently priced at +120.\n\nNine of the first 14 matches at the Euro 2024 went over 2.5 goals, but both England and Denmark stayed under that number in their opening games of the tournament.\n\nOdds as of June 19 at bet365. Get the current bet365 promo code to land a bonus for Euro 2024.\n\nEngland's odds to win Group C improved from -250 to -650 after Sunday's results. Denmark's odds to win the group faded from +400 to +700 when they only managed a point against Slovenia.\n\nJude Bellingham scored the only goal of England's tournament-opening win against Serbia, heading a deflected cross into the top of the goal in the 13th minute. England played very defensively once the lead was in hand. There were only 11 shot attempts in the game (seven for England, four for Serbia) and four on target (three for England, one for Serbia).\n\nAssuming both teams go with the same starting 11 on Thursday, here is how they will lineup.\n\nEngland vs Denmark Projected Lineups\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate made just three substitutions against Serbia, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold with Conor Gallagher in the 69th minutes, Bukayo Saka with Jared Bowen in the 76th, and Jude Bellingham with Kobbie Mainoo in the 86th.\n\nJoakim Maehle was the first player off the bench for Denmark against Slovenia, replacing Victor Kristiansen in the 78th minute.\n\nEngland Last 10 Matches\n\nEngland's win on Sunday was just its second in its past six matches, including friendlies. That said, in competitive fixtures, England is now 7-2-1 in its past ten, which includes two victories over Italy.\n\nDenmark's draw against Slovenia dropped its record to 7-2-1 in its past ten games.\n\nEngland vs Denmark Prediction\n\nEngland's 1-0 win on Sunday was a telling indication of how they are likely to play this tournament. Despite having some of the world's best offensive talents, Southgate doesn't seem inclined to play a wide-open, fast-paced style. And that's consistent with the manager's his longstanding approach with the Three Lions: they win low-scoring, low-event games.\n\nI expect a relatively disciplined, defensive approach from Denmark as well, who will feel the need to take at least a point from Thursday's game. They will be all too aware of how dangerous Bellingham, Saka, Foden, and Kane can be on the counterattack if they press up the field too forcefully.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sascha_paruk@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Sascha Paruk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_19507298.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1116, "textEnd": 1123}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

And the emphatic answer was no, because England's game management after going ahead was shambolic.\n\nSouthgate's men invited pressure and Christian Eriksen had a shot blocked, while another effort deflected off Marc Guehi onto the roof of the net.\n\nEngland had been asking for trouble, and got some on 34 minutes after losing the ball from their own throw in.\n\nHjulmand couldn't believe his luck and took aim from long range, blitzing a low drive into the bottom corner to equalise with his first ever international goal.\n\nHjulmand had another shot blocked and Joachim Andersen headed just off target.\n\nEngland were making this ageing Danish team look like the Brazilians of 1970.\n\nIt was turning into a horror show. Trent Alexander-Arnold was getting bypassed in midfield and the England stars started falling out amongst themselves.\n\nDeclan Rice and Pickford exchanged words, Bellingham started moping about and Kane looked like a spectator once again.\n\nIt was like Southgate had sent out 11 players - and told them to make it up as they go along.\n\nSomething had to change, but Southgate's decision to replace Alexander-Arnold with Conor Gallagher on 54 minutes did little to get the pulses racing.\n\nAt least Foden hit the post with a low effort, but it still took a desperate clearance from John Stones to stop Rasmus Hojlund from giving Denmark the lead at the opposite end.\n\nSouthgate had seen enough and sent on Ollie Watkins, Eberechi Eze and Jarrod Bowen.\n\nKane was hauled off, along with Foden, who'd been one of England's brightest sparks.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_cross@dailystar.co.uk", "name":

Just not good enough yet to have title ambitions.\n\nA 1-1 draw Thursday with Denmark -- a semifinalist last time, don't forget -- means England is unbeaten and all-but certain to advance to the round of 16.\n\nIt also was a slack, mistake-filled display that left coach Gareth Southgate angrily gesturing at his players for gifting a slew of scoring chances late in the game.\n\n\"The team didn't function today, that is my responsibility,\" said Southgate, who heard jeers from fans behind the England goal in a ragged second half.\n\nHarry Kane gave England another fast start at Euro 2024, scoring it the 18th minute, but the captain was substituted off in the second half as the team faded.\n\nDenmark leveled in the 34th when Morten Hjulmand fired in a powerful low shot from long distance, after Kane gave away the ball in defense.\n\nEight years with Southgate has earned England sustained tournament success. The Three Lions reached the final of Euro 2020 -- after beating Denmark in the last four -- and a semifinal and a quarterfinal at the past two World Cups.\n\n\"We're in the environment of winning on the biggest stage,\" the coach acknowledged, adding \"you have to accept what (criticism) comes our way.\"\n\nEngland has never won back-to-back games to begin a Euros and a pattern of second-game syndrome has repeated at three straight tournaments.\n\nOpening wins in the past three years have been following by tepid 0-0 draws with Scotland and the United States, now a 1-1 with the Danes who deserved more.\n\n\"I can't say we are disappointed but it's a shame,\" Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said. \"There is a result we could have gotten.\"\n\nStill, England started Euro 2024 by beating Serbia 1-0 and now sits top of Group C with four points. That tally always has been enough to advance in the 24-team Euros format where four third-place teams from the six groups go forward to the round of 16.\n\nEngland can finish in any position from first to third in the Group C standings after playing unbeaten Slovenia next Tuesday.\n\nSlovenia drew 1-1 with Serbia earlier Thursday, four days after getting the same result against Denmark. Serbia meets Denmark in their final games also on Tuesday evening.\n\nSouthgate had defended his players from what seemed like unfair criticism for the nervy nature of the win against Serbia, ceding some control after Jude Bellingham's early goal.\n\nBellingham was subdued Thursday and Southgate removed the stellar strike trio of Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka in one sweep in the 69th. Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Ollie Watkins came on and within two minutes Watkins almost scored with a shot after a darting run.\n\nThe coach's patience seemed to run out in the 85th when his players repeatedly gave away the ball and surrendered scoring chances. He gestured from the sideline with both index fingers pointing to his temples, urging them to think more.\n\nEngland had led by seizing on sleepiness in the Denmark defense. Hesitation by Victor Kristiansen let right-back Kyle Walker surge past him to steal the ball for a pass across the goalmouth.\n\nWhen the ball reached Kane he poked home a left-footed shot for a record extending 64th England goal for the captain.\n\nKane had his part in Denmark's leveler. His unwise pass out of defense soon went to Hjulmand, who strode forward to fire a low shot past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and in the net off his right-hand post.\n\nThe game was played beneath a closed stadium roof on slippery turf that cut up after steady rain this week.\n\nThe teams had royal watchers from the stands with the king of Denmark, Frederik X, and future king of England, Prince William, at the game.\n\nAn England team packed with aristocrats of club soccer and stars of the Champions League looked more common on Thursday.\n\n\"To achieve extraordinary things you have got to go through some difficult moments,\" said Southgate, whose team typically sticks around for the final week. \"Today was a difficult moment without a doubt.\"\n\nAP Euro 2024:

"A point was the least the Danes deserved as England again flattered to deceive in Frankfurt after an underwhelming 1-0 win over Serbia to open their tournament.\n\nHarry Kane had given the Three Lions an early lead as England pounced on a Danish defensive error.\n\nHjulmand's rocket from outside the box levelled before half-time and Denmark were left to rue missing late chances to secure a famous victory.\n\nEngland remain on top of Group C, two points clear of Slovenia, who they face in Cologne on Tuesday, and Denmark.\n\nSerbia's late equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Slovenia earlier on Thursday also keeps their destiny in their own hands.\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate said on Wednesday that he avoids media coverage during tournaments to escape negative stories.\n\nBut will be braced for more criticism after another flat display from one of the pre-tournament favourites.\n\nDenmark coach Kasper Hjulmand and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel claimed on the eve of the game they would not be fuelled by revenge for their Euro 2020 semi-final heartbreak to England three years ago.\n\nHowever, the Danes were a different beast from the side that disappointed at the 2022 World Cup and in drawing against Slovenia to open their tournament in Germany.\n\nDenmark had made the brighter start as both sides struggled to cope with a bobbly pitch in Frankfurt that cut up badly in just its second game of five at Euro 2024.\n\nYet, England capitalised on a howler from Hjulmand's men to take the lead on 18 minutes.\n\nVictor Kristiansen was caught unaware of Kyle Walker's run down the right and his deflected low cross fell perfectly for Kane to roll in his 13th goal at major tournaments.\n\nFailing to build on early 1-0 leads has been a consistent criticism of England under Southgate.\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup semi-final and final of Euro 2020, Croatia and Italy were able to wrestle away momentum from the Three Lions.\n\nThis time Denmark were not deterred by conceding, although it took a spectacular strike to bring them level.\n\nHjulmand was given far too much room by the England midfield to take aim but he took full advantage form long range with a blistering shot that clipped the inside of the post on its way in.\n\nSouthgate made no changes at the break, but the future of his experiment of playing Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in a midfield role is in doubt after he was hooked for Conor Gallagher on 55 minutes.\n\nPhil Foden's form for England had been a source of much debate after he again failed to shine at international level against Serbia.\n\nThe Manchester City playmaker looked much more like the man that won Premier League player of the year awards this season and was inches away from restoring England's lead with a low drive that came crashing back off the post.\n\nSouthgate's caution has been criticised in the past, but he was bold with his changes in the search for a winner as Kane, Foden and Bukayo Saka were sacrificed for Eberechi Eze, Ollie Watkins and Jarrod Bowen.\n\nWatkins nearly made an immediate impact as he was denied by Schmeichel after a brilliant through ball from Jude Bellingham.\n\nYet, it was Denmark who had the better chances to take all three points in the closing stages.\n\nAndreas Christensen spooned over when unmarked from a corner before Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg curled inches wide.", "source":

Despite the crucial three points, the Three Lions failed to roar to victory. If England are to be as unconvincing once again, Denmark may be able to take advantage.\n\nThe Danes drew their opening match 1-1 with Slovenia. They understand a win against England is vital if they want to secure a place in the knockout stage. With plenty at stake, both teams could cancel each other out.\n\nProbable Lineups for Denmark vs England\n\nThe probable lineup for Denmark in the \"system of play.\"\n\nThe probable lineup for England in the \"system of play.\"\n\nDanes to keep England at arm's length\n\nEngland's performance against Serbia was markedly inconsistent between the two halves. This led to plenty of questions for Gareth Southgate from the media at full-time.\n\nThe new centre-back duo of Marc Guehi and John Stones were solid at the back for England, who were tested on several occasions as England dropped deeper. However, overall, the Three Lions defended well.\n\nDenmark will be England's toughest test in Group C. Their high energy and press shown against Slovenia may well disrupt England's overall flow. Both teams drew in the last Euros semi-final in normal time, and it's possible this will end the same at big odds.\n\nAfter losing to Iceland prior to their 1-0 win over Serbia, England haven't shown their best qualities in front of goal, and that doesn't look like changing any time soon.\n\nWith just three shots on target against Serbia, England finished with an xG of just 0.54, which is highly concerning for Gareth Southgate.\n\nSouthgate's side also only won one corner against Serbia, showcasing their lack of effort to test their full-backs and break down a \"weaker\" side in their group opener.\n\nDenmark may have conceded against Slovenia, but it came in the form of a heavily deflected strike which was rather unfortunate for the Danes. If Denmark lose against England, qualification may be out of reach, so expect a disciplined performance from them as they aim to frustrate the Three Lions in Frankfurt.\n\nAlthough goals may be at a premium, there's every chance both teams can find the back of the net, resulting in a 1-1 draw.\n\nDenmark had 16 shots of their own against Slovenia and finished with an xG of 1.72. They were extremely unfortunate not to have collected all three points.\n\nLet's not forget the Danes held England to a 1-1 draw in the last Euros. With Christian Eriksen pulling the strings in his number 10 role, expect Denmark to create chances against England on Thursday evening.\n\nSerbia saw a lot more of the ball than they had expected.

In both matches, they failed to build on early first goals.\n\nRegardless of whether England secure passage to the knockout rounds in Germany, supporters will fear a repeat against the stronger opponents who await.\n\nThis is how England slipped into a familiar pattern against Denmark.\n\nDropping deep\n\nAfter Harry Kane opened the scoring at Waldstadion, it immediately led to England's back four retreating towards their own penalty area. It was like they were playing 20 yards closer to Jordan Pickford's goal. When Morten Hjulmand levelled from long-range there were two centre-backs in their area. Gareth Southgate's backline should have been further up the pitch rather than inviting pressure. A touch map of the first half showed most of the action being in England's half, which was due to them dropping deeper. It was the same story in their Group C opener against Serbia only they managed to hold on for their win.\n\nLosing shape\n\nPhil Foden had two good chances from the edge of the area and both were from a central No10 role. They were among the more positive moves of the first half but England do lose balance when he drifts inside. At one point he chased a ball across to the other flank and Denmark were able to switch play. England needed to be tighter as a midfield three. Jude Bellingham was playing further forward than Declan Rice and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Denmark were having joy playing through England with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Hjulmand exploiting space.\n\nNo outball\n\nWhile under the cosh, there was a moment when Bukaya Saka had the chance to break but his counter-attack was very smartly halted by a tactical foul from a Dane. England needed to find their pacy attackers when they got on the ball, which is down to getting accurate passes out of defence and midfield once possession is won. Just before Alexander-Arnold came off he went on a powerful run through the middle and these counter-attacks relieved the pressure and put England back on top in the second half.\n\nNot changing it up\n\nSouthgate waited until the 54th minute before making changes and could have easily started making subs at half-time. He has faith in his 4-2-3-1 system but Conor Gallagher, his first replacement, is a different type of player to Alexander-Arnold, adding plenty of energy but losing the range of passing of the Liverpool midfielder. Some on the bench such as Eberechi Eze or Anthony Gordon could have been given a chance - just a change of legs to ask the Danes a different question.\n\nThe 16 minutes that saw England lose control against Denmark\n\nWithin moments of the game resuming after Kane's goal we see a tactical theme that caused England problems throughout the half. Denmark's 5-4-1 defensive shape flipped to a 3-2-5 in attack when their wing-backs Victor Kristiansen and Joakim Maehle pushed forward. That front five stretched the pitch and out-numbered England's usual back four.\n\nIn reaction, Rice drops on to Denmark forward Jonas Wind to match their forward five. Kieran Trippier is reluctant to jump out to Maehle, which could have sparked Marc Guehi to jump to Wind and preserve England's shape. The result is a crater of space in midfield.\n\nDenmark looked to turn England around with long balls, from where they could pen Southgate's side in. A theme of England's opening two games is that when they were pushed back, they stayed back. In this instance, every England player bar Bellingham is camped in and around their own penalty area. Diligent defensive work to be sure, and in the Premier League we see high pressing teams crunch behind the ball when the time is right, but it made it difficult for England to escape.\n\nWhen Bukayo Saka hammers the ball clear, England have nobody contesting the first ball or even the second. It is simple for Denmark to recycle possession at start another attack. Southgate decided against picking one of England's best counter-attacking runners in Marcus Rashford, but does have Anthony Gordon and Ollie Watkins as options to fulfil this role. Tired legs after a long seasons makes springing attacks from deep even harder.\n\nEngland's distances without the ball were also far too big from front to back. Again and again, Rice and Alexander-Arnold were not able or not in position to lay a glove on Denmark's midfielders. In the below example, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (hardly Andres Iniesta) was able to receive the ball from a central defender and turn under no pressure. Rice stands with his arms outstretched, his exasperation clear for all to see. England were too concerned by what might be happening over their shoulder to step in.\n\nEngland also had their share of problems in possession, with Denmark the more effective pressing team. Here, Pickford had options to play out through Marc Guehi and Kieran Trippier or the riskier pass into Rice. Instead he opts to go long towards Kane. Nothing wrong with that per se, but England are not set up to compete for the second ball.\n\nAfter Janik Vestergaard wins the header in front of an unsupported Kane, Bellingham is the only England player vaguely in the picture. There are merits to playing short and long. What a team must not do is set up to play short and then go long, because the unit will be stretched and the ball will come straight back.\n\nChristian Eriksen can control, turn and play without an England player near him. This is a player who struggled to cope with the intensity of Premier League football last season. With this kind of space he could play until he is 50.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_zeqiri@telegraph.co.uk", "name":

It came from Kyle Walker's great determination to capitalise on a lapse in concentration from Victor Kristiansen on the flank.\n\nThere was a bit of fortune that the cross fell to Kane's feet, but it was luck well-deserved. Kane's finish was calm under pressure, with the Bayern Munich striker scoring his fifth goal at a European Championship.\n\nKane is only the third player to score in four separate major tournaments for England, after Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney, having also scored at Euro 2020 and the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. He's also the only player to score at least five goals at both the World Cup and European Championship for England.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, but England showed promising signs, playing much better than they did in the second half against Serbia. There was a clear shape with Kane leading the line, the full-backs pushing up high, particularly Walker who linked up well with Bukayo Saka.\n\nBut, just as they did against Serbia, England sat back and allowed Denmark to apply pressure. And, unlike against Serbia, it proved costly. As the average positions below showed, both Walker and Kieran Trippier's dropped below the halfway line. Trent Alexander-Arnold was also a lot deeper, rendering him pretty ineffective as he had no one to really play the ball over the top to.\n\nInterestingly, Walker said after the game that Southgate isn't telling the players to sit back, instead talking about the reading of the game on the pitch.\n\n\"I think it's just the game. You're sensing the game, you're sensing their feelings,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"They probably had the upper hand in certain parts of the game, so you go off of that. As defenders you try to think of 'what if', rather than me charging forward, they go and score and all of a sudden they're blaming us in defence that we're not in position.\"\n\nDenmark were level just after the half-hour mark thanks to Morten Hjulmand's long-range effort, after Kane had given the ball away in his own half with an errant pass.\n\nKane did only misplace one other pass, but his passes were coming in the wrong area for England. In fact, he spent a lot of the time in the wrong areas of the pitch.\n\nWe all know that Kane's game has changed over the past few years, with the striker liking to drop a lot deeper to influence matches. He has the passing range to be able to do so, he just needs the players to run in behind in the space he leaves.\n\nThe problem for England against Denmark, though, was that they were trying to press but didn't have Kane involved in that press. His starting position was far too deep, allowing the Denmark defence to advance with the ball and push England back. In the first half, Kane had just 14 touches in the first half, completing six of his eight passes.\n\nSpeaking at half time, both Rio Ferdinand and Micah Richards were scathing of the England captain.\n\n\"I'd be going mad. I'd be screaming,\" Ferdinand said.\n\n\"I couldn't have my centre forward not filling in with the workload that the other players are putting in. I need to see that intensity at some point. Put their centre halves under the pressure that I'm receiving as an England defender.\"\n\nRichards added: \"There's a conundrum with the way England want to set up. They want to press and they've got the players to press but Harry Kane is so good at scoring goals, and his record is unbelievable. And when his goal comes, you're thinking, 'okay, Harry Kane, confident'. But the other side of the game, he just needs to improve.\"\n\nKane was taken off in the 69th minute, with the score still at 1-1 and England under pressure. He had eight further touches in the second half, ending the match with 13 passes completed from 15 attempts. But, a point worth noting is that six of Kane's passes were backwards. Not good for England.\n\n\"In all honesty Harry Kane needs to do a lot better,\" said Gary Lineker.\n\n\"He's plodding short, very lethargically, and that's not going to help. He's not creating space for himself.\"\n\nEngland do still sit top of Group C on four points, but qualification for the last 16 isn't secure just yet.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

This will be the first time the two teams will face each other since the Euro 2020 semi-final which the Three Lions won 2-1 from behind in extra time at Wembley Stadium.\n\nDenmark led the game thanks to Christian Eriksen's goal in the 17th minute. The Manchester United star chested his teammate Joans Wind's flick to find the nets. However, the Danish were left disappointed after Slovenia levelled in the second half.\n\nDenmark manager Kasper Hjulmand has reflected on the match and said that the side was \"too passive\" and lacked energy in the closing stage of the game. He has maintained that the team needs to play intense football throughout the game if they want to collect three points from one of the two remaining group fixtures.\n\nSince the beginning of March 2023, the Danish have been tough to beat, with just one loss from their 13 games. However, their 1-1 draw against Slovenia meant they had only one win from their last six group matches at the European. The 1992 winners now need to gain enough points to ensure they don't exit consecutive major tournaments from the group stage after failing to reach knockouts in the 2022 World Cup.\n\nEngland will come to the match as the only team that has won a game in Group C. Though Jude Bellingham put his side in the lead early, the English team didn't trouble the scorers after their goal. This resulted in a nervy 2nd half after the Serbians came back as a much more aggressive unit.\n\nHowever, the 1-0 win has led to English manager Gareth Southgate taking positives from the game stating that the side was resilient at the face of constant Serbian threats. A win against Denmark will ensure England reach the final 16.\n\nEngland have remained undefeated in the group stage since Euros 2004. They are also the first team in the European Championship to keep clean sheets in five consecutive group-stage games of the competition.\n\nDenmark boss Hjulmand may go with the same starting lineup on Thursday with Joachim Andersen along with Barcelona's Andreas Christensen and Leicester City's Jannik Vestergaard remaining in the three-man defence in front of goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nJoakim Maehle may get a call as a wing-back in place of Alexander Bah or Victor Kristiansen. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg will link with Morten Hjulmand in the centre-midfield. Rasmus Hojlund with 15 international appearances for Denmark will feature alongside Jonas Wind. Eriksen is expected to continue as the number 10 role.\n\nEngland will mostly remain unchanged except for a couple of changes with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden likely to get dropped to the bench. Foden has struggled to make an impact on the left flank. The Manchester City star's preferred position of central or right is filled by Bellingham and Saka respectively. Foden may get replaced by Anthony Gordon, Cole Palmer or Eberechi Eze.\n\nThough Kieran Trippier did suffer cramps against Serbia towards the match's end he is expected to feature in the game English skipper Harry Kane, will lead the line and make an impact in the final third.\n\nOf the 22 games England have played against Denmark, they have won 13 while Serbia have won four games. Both sides have played five draw games. While England have an upper hand in the head-to-head, Denmark isn't a team that can be written off easily and will look to ensure their place in the final 16.\n\nDenmark: Schmeichel; Andersen,

England won 2-1 after extra time, sealed when Harry Kane followed up his penalty being saved by Kasper Schmeichel to score when the ball rebounded to him.\n\n-- Denmark did not easily forget how England got that decisive spot-kick, for a foul awarded against defender Joakim M\u00e6hle -- \"a penalty which should not have been a penalty,\" coach Kasper Hjulmand said then.\n\n-- There is a familiarity between the squads with teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Brentford on either side of this game.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- Gareth Southgate is coaching England at his fourth tournament and will be less troubled than analysts and fans about the manner of victory over Serbia. England eased its way through the group stage at Euro 2020 -- making at least two changes between each game -- did not concede a goal, then accelerated through the knockout rounds.\n\n-- Southgate's main call could be if Trent Alexander-Arnold's long-range passing is retained in central midfield alongside Declan Rice. Recent debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton are options.\n\n-- England's preferred left back Luke Shaw is still not involved in team training, and Kieran Trippier is set to continue on his less favored flank.\n\n-- Denmark has reported no injury concerns.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- A draw can be a good result for Denmark even if it ends the day third in the standings. Slovenia plays Serbia in the earlier game Thursday. In two previous Euros with a 24-team tournament format -- which sends four of the six third-place teams to the knockout phase -- a team with three draws has done enough to advance.\n\n-- Another England win would set the team up to win Group C and face a third-place team in the round of 16. The group runner-up will face the Group A winner, likely Germany, in the vibrant Dortmund stadium.\n\n-- However, England has never won two straight games to start a Euros tournament.\n\n-- Defender Simon Kjaer was an unused substitute against Slovenia and his Denmark record of 132 national-team games is now just one ahead of Christian Eriksen, who scored in that 1-1 draw.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n-- \"We see it every day in training here, and he's such a nice guy as well. You know he has high standards that he sets and expects.\" -- England midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, 19, on star teammate Jude Bellingham, who turns 21 next week\n\n-- \"Once the tournament starts you get into a rhythm. It came and we won it. So, we're confident now, we're happy.\" -- England winger Bukayo Saka on winning the first game\n\n-- \"We have it in our power to have a fantastic game against England where nobody expects us to win.\" -- Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors":

Picture: Adrian DENNIS / AFP\n\nHarry Kane insisted England will find the right formula for Euro 2024 success despite their lacklustre display in Thursday's 1-1 draw against Denmark.\n\nGareth Southgate's side would have qualified for the last 16 as Group C winners if they had defeated the Danes in Frankfurt.\n\nEngland captain Kane gave them the perfect start with a clinical close-range finish from Kyle Walker's deflected cross in the 18th minute.\n\nBut England lost their momentum after that and Denmark drew level after 34 minutes when Morten Hjulmand blasted a superb 30-yard drive past Jordan Pickford.\n\nIt was hardly the kind of display that will strike fear into England's rivals, with the incoherent effort coming after they were fortunate to escape with a 1-0 win against Serbia in their group opener last weekend.\n\nBut Bayern Munich striker Kane is adamant England will eventually fire on all cylinders.\n\n\"I think we said before the tournament there's no easy games and I think that's showing,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got levels we can reach and we can be better both with and without the ball.\n\n\"The sign of a good team is when you're not playing at your best and still find a way to get results like we have in the last two games.\"\n\nEngland are still on course to reach the last 16 as they sit top of the group with four points heading into their last game against Slovenia.\n\nBut they will want to win the group, which would likely ensure an easier draw in the last 16.\n\nFormer England players including Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand were scathing in their criticism of the Three Lions' latest limp showing in Germany.\n\nWhile Kane acknowledged there would be doubters after the performance, he expects England to ride out the storm.\n\n\"We're top of the group. We know we can improve. I know there will probably be loads of noise and a bit of disappointment back home.\n\n\"We experienced this in the last Euros as well when we drew to Scotland.

The bad news is everything else.\n\nA 1-1 draw against Denmark edged them closer to the round of 16 but if they play anything like they played in the Waldstadion, that will be the limit of their participation in this European Championship.\n\nEngland were woeful in the sultry heat of early evening. They were outplayed almost from start to finish by the Danes. It is hard to think of a single player who emerged with credit.\n\nEngland were sloppy in possession, they lacked fluency, they lacked verve, they lacked confidence, they lacked cohesion. They looked clumsy and basic beside their technically accomplished opponents.\n\nTo add to that, Gareth Southgate's plan to play Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield alongside Declan Rice appears to be in ruins. Alexander-Arnold is a quite brilliant passer of the ball but he has been largely ineffectual in an unfamiliar role.\n\nEngland were held to a 1-1 draw with Denmark which leaves them top of Group C as it stands\n\nIt was a disappointing performance from Gareth Southgate's men in their second group game\n\nSouthgate will need to be ruthless in his plans if the Three Lions are to roar again\n\nEngland are unbeaten in two games but it was an unconvincing display from the Three Lions\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: What Jude Bellingham must do to elevate his game LISTEN: It's All Kicking Off at the Euros.

He was getting out before it was too late.\n\nMATCH FACTS\n\nDENMARK: (3-4-1-2) Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Maehle, Hjulmand (Norgaard 82), Hojbjerg, Kristiansen (Bah 57); Eriksen (Skov Olsen 82); Wind (Damsgaard 57), Hojlund (Poulsen 67)\n\nSubs not used: Hermansen (GK), Ronnow (GK); Kjaer, Jensen, Dolberg, Jorgensen, Dreyer, Kristensen, Bruun Larsen\n\nGoals: Hjulmand (34)\n\nBookings: Vestergaard (27), Maehle (73), Norgaard (87)\n\nCoach: Kasper Hjulmand\n\nENGLAND: (4-2-3-1) Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold (Gallagher 54), Rice; Saka (Eze 69), Bellingham, Foden (Bowen 69); Kane (Watkins 69)\n\nSubs not used: Ramsdale (GK), Henderson (GK); Konsa, Dunk, Toney, Gordon, Gomez, Palmer, Wharton, Mainoo\n\nGoals: Kane (18)\n\nBookings: Gallagher (61)\n\nCoach: Gareth Southgate\n\nReferee: Artur Soares Dias (Portugal)\n\nVenue: Deutsche Bank Park (Frankfurt)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether Alexander-Arnold starts another match in this tournament in midfield remains to be seen but Southgate was ruthless in the selection of his squad and it looks as if he will have to be ruthless here.\n\nIt was a fine plan in theory but it has not worked yet and tournaments do not provide time. Southgate acted because England were in danger of being overrun.\n\nNo one was safe last night. England skipper Harry Kane put England ahead but he was substituted in the second half, too. So was Bukayo Saka. So, too, Phil Foden, although Foden was perhaps England's best player. It was not a high bar.\n\nNow England have to gather themselves. They are top of Group C and even if they lose to Slovenia in their final game in Cologne, it is unlikely they will be eliminated. But that kind of talk is a far cry from the optimism that accompanied them when they flew to Germany.\n\nEngland had made an uncertain start. Alexander-Arnold was nutmegged in the first minute, Kyle Walker lost his footing over and over again and had to change his boots, and Kieran Trippier gave the ball away.\n\nBut after 13 minutes, England got their first glimpse of an opening. Walker, rebooted, slipped a pass inside to Foden and Foden span sharply, made space for himself in the box and then lifted his left-foot shot just too high. It was a welcome hint of the Foden we are used to.\n\nFive minutes later, England were ahead. Victor Kristiansen was so busy shepherding a ball away from Bukayo Saka on the Denmark left that he did not see Walker hurtling past him on his blind side.\n\nWalker stole the ball from him, advanced towards the goal-line and whipped a cross into the box. Saka prodded at it and it squirted loose to Kane, who had the simple task of sliding it low past Kasper Schmeichel into the bottom corner from a few yards out.\n\nBut Denmark remained undaunted. They continued to play the better football, they kept the ball better, they looked more confident and more fluid. Christian Eriksen was, as usual, at the core of everything they did.\n\nHarry Kane gave England the lead after 18 minutes to give his side the early advantage\n\nEngland's No 9 guides the ball into the bottom corner of the net after a well-worked move\n\nKane was sharpish to the ball as he pounced after it pinballed inside Denmark area\n\nKane celebrates scoring the opener while full-back Kieran Trippier (back) joins him\n\nMorten Hjulmand (No 21) celebrates after equalising with a long-range stunner\n\nWith no England player to pressure him, Hjulmand fires a shot at goal from 30 yards out\n\nHjulmand's shot strikes the base of Pickford's post before ricocheting into the net\n\nHjulmand (left) wheels away in celebration after levelling the scores in style for Denmark\n\nDenmark deserved an equaliser and ten minutes before half time, they got one. Kane received the ball under pressure at a throw in deep in England's half and hit the ball infield blindly.\n\nDenmark pounced on it and when it was moved straight to Morten Hjulmand 30 yards out, he took a touch and then let fly from 30 yards. The shot was beautifully and ferociously hit and it arrowed beyond Pickford's despairing dive and in off the goalkeeper's right-hand post.\n\nEngland were being outplayed. A minute before the interval, Hojlund held the ball up well on the edge of the England area and laid the ball back into the path of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg whose curling shot was on target but well saved by Pickford.\n\nMany wondered if Southgate might withdraw Alexander-Arnold at half-time and accept that the experiment was not working.\n\nHe did not and Alexander-Arnold played one superb long ball over the top of the Denmark defence to Saka that Saka nodded over Schmeichel but into the side-netting.\n\nPhil Foden creates space to shoot but leans back too far and blasts his shot over the bar\n\nThe state of the pitch at the Frankfurt Arena came under huge criticism during the game\n\nDenmark piled the pressure on England towards the end of the first half after equalising\n\nBellingham (centre) is closed down by two Danish defenders during an England attack\n\nIt was Alexander-Arnold's last contribution. Eight minutes after the break, the fourth official raised the digital board and Alexander-Arnold's number was up. He was replaced by Conor Gallagher. It may be that he does not start another game in this tournament.\n\nREAD MORE Fans SLAM the state of 'absolutely s***' pitch for England's clash with Denmark\n\nEngland seemed to respond immediately. Foden danced through midfield and smashed a low drive past Schmeichel but it cannoned off the base of the post and Saka could not force home the rebound.\n\nSouthgate made more changes midway through the half. Foden gave way for Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze and Ollie Watkins came on for Saka and Kane. England were still trying to wrest control of the match.\n\nBellingham produced one brilliant pass to free Watkins but Watkins delayed a fraction too long before shooting, the angle got tighter and his effort was well saved by Schmeichel.\n\nDenmark nearly snatched victory three times in the space of two minutes as the clock ticked down. Marc Guehi was sold short by a pass from Declan Rice and lost the ball to Alexander Bah but as Bah bore down on goal, Guehi recovered superbly and blocked his cross.\n\nSouthgate (left) decided to bring off Alexander-Arnold (No 8) in the 54th minute for Gallagher\n\nSaka battles for the ball as Schmeichel (right) rushes out of his goal to clear the danger\n\nAndreas Christensen should have scored from the resulting corner but he leaned back when the ball fell to him six yards out and his shot cleared the bar.\n\nAs England tried to play the ball out from the back, Walker gave it away and Hojbjerg curled a shot just wide of the post.\n\nSo England finished the game clinging on, grateful for a point. They left looking like beaten men. It is time to rip it up and start again.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Denmark was denied by Slovenia's late leveler in a 1-1 draw also on Sunday. They meet in Frankfurt at the Waldstadion where kickoff is at 7pm Qatar time (1600 GMT). Here's what to know about the match:\n\nMatch facts - Denmark's need for a win is greater, ahead of a final Group C game against a physically imposing Serbia team.\n\n- The teams renew their rivalry from a Euro 2020 semifinal played three years ago at Wembley Stadium. England won 2-1 after extra time, sealed when Harry Kane followed up his penalty being saved by Kasper Schmeichel to score when the ball rebounded to him.\n\n- Denmark did not easily forget how England got that decisive spot-kick, for a foul awarded against defender Joakim M\u00e6hle - \"a penalty which should not have been a penalty,\" coach Kasper Hjulmand said then. Hjulmand said Wednesday he's not thinking about that incident anymore, preferring to look at the next game \"through the front window.\"\n\n- There is a familiarity between the squads with teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Brentford on either side of this game.\n\nTeam news - Gareth Southgate is coaching England at his fourth tournament and will be less troubled than analysts and fans about the manner of victory over Serbia. England eased its way through the group stage at Euro 2020 - making at least two changes between each game - did not concede a goal, then accelerated through the knockout rounds.\n\n- Southgate's main call could be if Trent Alexander-Arnold's long-range passing is retained in central midfield alongside Declan Rice. Recent debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton are options.\n\n- England's preferred left back Luke Shaw is still not involved in team training, and Kieran Trippier should continue on his less favored flank.\n\n- Denmark has reported no injury concerns with defender Simon Kjaer, its captain at Euro 2020, fit to return.\n\nBy the numbers - A draw can be a good result for Denmark even if it ends the day third in the standings. Slovenia plays Serbia in the earlier game Thursday. In two previous Euros with a 24-team tournament format - which sends four of the six third-place teams to the knockout phase - a team with three draws has done enough to advance.\n\n- Another England win would set the team up to win Group C and face a third-place team in the round of 16. The group runner-up will face the Group A winner, likely Germany, in the vibrant Dortmund stadium.\n\n- However, England has never won two straight games to start a Euros tournament.\n\n- Denmark's Kjaer was an unused substitute against Slovenia and his Denmark record of 132 national-team games is now just one ahead of Christian Eriksen, who scored in that 1-1 draw.\n\nWhat they're saying - \"We see it every day in training here, and he's such a nice guy as well. You know he has high standards that he sets and expects.\" - England midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, 19, on star teammate Jude Bellingham, who turns 21 next week.\n\n- \"Once the tournament starts you get into a rhythm.

None of the three previous meetings at major competitions have ended with the Danes victorious, indeed the Mikkel Damsgaard free kick with which they took the lead in the last meeting was the first tournament goal the Danes had scored against England.\n\nGoals were something of a precious commodity for both teams in their opening games but England's solitary strike proved to be enough to overcome Serbia a few hours after Denmark were held to a 1-1 draw with Slovenia. After Serbia and Slovenia played to a 1-1 draw on Thursday the group is wide open. All those results mean that another win for Gareth Southgate's side would take them into the last 16 and may be enough to guarantee them top spot.

It was a more nervy game than it needed to be, a pre-tournament favorite holding on to Jude Bellingham's goal for 80 minutes when they had the talent to do so much more. Still England have previous in tournament football when it comes to grinding their way through games, trusting their defense to hold firm.\n\nDenmark weren't able to do that and will doubtless be loath to avoid a situation where they have to win their final game against Serbia having taken only a point from their first two games. \"We have to stick together,\" said Kasper Schmeichel. \"Any time you play a team with that much quality, you have to be able to stick together, defend well, and we have to take our chances when they come.\"\n\nDon't miss CBS Sports Golazo Network's Morning Footy, now in podcast form!

And what of Phil Foden, whose 35 caps have not really delivered the sort of stand out performance that was the norm with Manchester City last season? For now expect those two to keep their starting berth in what should be an unchanged XI.\n\nHopes of Luke Shaw returning very quickly have been quelled by Southgate, who said: \"He won't be involved tomorrow. He's actually on track for where we thought originally. We were hoping a couple of days ago that we might accelerate that but he needs a bit more volume work.\"\n\nPossible England XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold, Rice; Saka, Bellingham, Foden; Kane\n\nPrediction\n\nThis could be another display where England leave their public wanting more but get the three points that really matter most.

Despite the result, England retains the top spot with four points, while Denmark is second with two points.\n\nIt was a second successive lacklustre performance from Gareth Southgate's men, who squandered the chance to become the first England team to win their two opening games at a Euro tournament. The draw leaves the 2020 runners-up, previously touted as tournament favourites, at the top of Group C on four points, while Denmark are second on two after Slovenia's 1-1 draw with Serbia earlier.\n\nThe game got off to a sloppy start with wayward passes from both teams, quickly silencing the sea of red and white fans, a crowd that included the Prince of Wales and Denmark's King Frederik. But Kane -- who has now scored more goals at major tournaments than any other England player with 13 -- got England on the scoreboard in the 18th minute when Kyle Walker swooped in behind an unsuspecting Victor Kristiansen and fired in a cross that eventually fell to Kane.\n\nThe captain lunged and sent a left-footed shot from close range into the bottom left corner. The goal draws him level with Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as the players to score for England at the most major tournaments, with four apiece. Denmark were the better team after that, however, and an equaliser felt inevitable.\n\nThe Danes capitalised on England's sloppy play in the 34th minute when Kane's pass up the field from a throw-in went to Kristiansen, who passed to Hjulmand. The 24-year-old launched a rocket from about 30 yards out that ricocheted off the left post and into the net.

The goal draws him level with Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as the players to score for England at the most major tournaments, with four apiece.\n\nDenmark were the better team after that, however, and an equaliser felt inevitable.\n\nThe Danes capitalised on England\u2019s sloppy play in the 34th minute when Kane\u2019s pass up the field from a throw-in went to Kristiansen, who passed to Morten Hjulmand. The 24-year-old launched a rocket that ricocheted off the left post and into the net.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t quite dawned on me yet \u2013 to score a goal for Denmark at a major finals is really, really big, so of course I\u2019m proud,\u201d Hjulmand said.\n\nDenmark\u2019s midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg felt his side should have won, however.\n\n\u201cI would have traded it for three points,\u201d he said of his man of the match award. \u201cWe played well, we played smart, annoying that we couldn\u2019t get one to go in. We have a lot we can take with us, we have to keep looking ahead and do it, we have time.\u201d\n\nLooking to inject some fresh legs and energy, Southgate took off Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka with about 20 minutes to play and replaced them with Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze.\n\nBoth teams squandered chances, however, the narrowest miss coming from Foden, who rang a shot off the post in the second half in a far more lively performance from him on Thursday than in the Serbia game.\n\nJude Bellingham, who scored England\u2019s lone goal in their 1-0 opening win against Serbia in a dazzling first-half performance, barely factored on Thursday against Denmark\u2019s physical midfield of Hojbjerg and Hjulmand.\n\nWithin a few minutes of the final whistle, the England fans had largely cleared out, while the Denmark end remained full of celebrating supporters.\n\n\u201cWe understand the supporters\u2019 frustration from the outside, but as a staff and a team we need to stay together,\u201d said England defender Kieran Trippier, who won his 50th cap. \u201cWe know as players we can take it up so many levels.\u201d\n\nEngland take on Slovenia in their final group

Denmark's influence grew and grew and they scored a deserved equaliser through Kasper Hjulmand after 34 minutes.\n\nThe result means England are top of Group C with four points from two games, ahead of their final match against Slovenia on June 25. Denmark are second in the group with two points, and play Serbia in their final game.\n\nJack Pitt-Brooke, Mark Carey, Dan Sheldon and James McNicholas analyse the key talking points from the game in Frankfurt...\n\nIn both England's games at Euro 2024, they have taken an early lead. Ordinarily a goal in the first 20 minutes would be expected to settle any nerves, and provide a platform on which to build for the rest of the game.\n\nInstead, England have responded to those early goals with lethargic passing, conservative positioning and a total abolition of offensive movement.\n\nFor the remainder of the first half, England seemed to have problems all through their spine. In midfield, Declan Rice and Trent Alexander-Arnold were pinned back on the edge of their penalty box. Ahead, Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice seemed to want to occupy all the same spaces. England looked ragged and out of ideas.\n\nA persistent criticism of Gareth Southgate has been England's inability to control games. Their ongoing inability to seize the initiative -- even when ahead -- will only lead to more scrutiny.\n\nJames McNicholas\n\nDespite the opening goal, this was not a classic Harry Kane performance.\n\nHe started the game in the best possible way, slotting in Walker's cross to put England 1-0 up in the 18th minute. It felt like an important goal for a man who has made a habit of starting the last two tournaments slowly before finding his best form during the knockout phase. That made this the first goal he had scored in a group stage since his hat-trick against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod almost six years ago.\n\nBut just as Kane was criticised for not doing enough in the build-up against Serbia, today he was criticised for not doing enough as a conventional No 9. He didn't press, didn't run in behind and never looked at 100 per cent.\n\nEven then it was still a surprise when he was replaced with over 20 minutes left for Ollie Watkins. He was carrying a back injury at the end of the season with Bayern Munich, and Southgate has been keen to protect him in tournaments before, so he doesn't always play 90 minutes.\n\nBut it certainly raises questions going into the Slovenia game, just as there have been in group stages before.\n\nJack Pitt-Brooke\n\nMorten Hjulmand's equaliser was struck from 30.9 metres out, making it the longest-range goal at the Euros since Mikkel Damsgard's goal -- for Denmark -- against England in 2021. As sloppy as England were in the build-up, it was an outstanding strike.\n\nThe 24-year-old Sporting CP midfielder has been linked with a move to Tottenham -- but Spurs' interest may hit a snag.\n\n\"My dad supported and we watched games together when we were younger,\" Hjulmand told Sporting's in-house television channel. \"When I started watching football, Arsenal had a fantastic team and Patrick Vieira was the captain and played in midfield. He was and is a great inspiration for me.\"\n\nIt's more than a casual attachment -- Hjulmand has the special crest which commemorates the 125th anniversary of Arsenal's formation tattooed on his left arm.\n\nJames McNicholas\n\nSouthgate made a triple substitution with just over 20 minutes remaining, bringing on Eberechi Eze for Bukayo Saka, Jarrod Bowen in place of Phil Foden and Ollie Watkins for Kane.\n\nBowen went wide right, Eze slotted in on the left and Watkins played through the middle.\n\nWatkins made a quick start, forcing the Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel into tipping his shot out for a corner after Jude Bellingham's defence-splitting pass set the Aston Villa striker free.\n\nThe trio's pace and direct style of play gave Denmark something else to think about and, at times, they threatened to get in behind and stretch England's Group C opponents, only for a foul or misplaced pass to halt their progress.\n\nBut the main issue for Southgate's side, particularly in the final exchanges, is that they did not see enough of the ball. Denmark were far more comfortable in possession and at no point did they look troubled.\n\nConor Gallagher had replaced Trent Alexander-Arnold in the 54th minute and was quickly booked for a foul on Joakim Maehle. As always with the Chelsea midfielder, he wasn't short of energy but the change did not help England regain control of midfield and Denmark created chances in the final minutes.\n\nDan Sheldon\n\nThe positive take on England's right flank is that they do look dangerous in a lot of their attacking sequences worked down that side of the pitch.\n\nAgainst Serbia, it was Bukayo Saka's cross that led to Jude Bellingham's headed goal, and Kyle Walker's pace and overlapping run was crucial to England's opener against Denmark. There is the right balance on that side of the pitch, and Saka in particular looks to be having a strong start to the tournament in his first two games.\n\nEngland identified a weakness in Denmark's left side of defence and channelled a lot of their attack down that side, with 44 per cent of their attacking touches coming from the right flank. Across the two games, 12 crosses have been made for the right, with just four from the left. Unfortunately, that skew towards England's attack speaks to the negative take on proceedings -- that it is largely borne out of necessity.\n\nIt has been well-documented, but playing a right-footed Kieran Trippier at left-back is not going to offer that same overlapping threat -- or pace in wide areas -- and Phil Foden ahead of him is so much more of a ball-to-feet player who enjoys drifting inside and picking up pockets of space in tight areas. When opponents know that to be the case, they can adapt their own attacking game plan accordingly as England become predictable going forward.\n\nThe optimistic view is that England's right side of attack is looking strong. The pessimistic view is that their left flank is lacking the same pace and penetration.\n\nMark Carey\n\nIt took all of seven minutes for the pitch to show it wasn't quite up to scratch, with Denmark and England players slipping and sliding all over the place, most notably Kyle Walker who went down and took a significant chunk of grass with him.\n\nThe 34-year-old then jogged past the England dugout and signalled that he wanted a different pair of boots, realising there wasn't enough grip on the ones he was wearing.\n\nIt is not the first grass-related issue at this tournament either, with the pitch at Borussia Dortmund's Merkur-Spiel Arena needing to be relaid twice and then dig up and put down a third time after UEFA inspected it and said it was still unsatisfactory.\n\nAlthough the state of the pitch, which was last relaid in November, is a damaging reflection on the host venue, more alarmingly it is a risk to the players who could easily roll an ankle or injure themselves far more seriously as there is little to no support underfoot.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "more@nytimes.com", "name":

England faces Denmark on Thursday as the leader of Group C at the European Championship after a 1-0 win over Serbia.

Denmark was denied by Slovenia's late leveler in a 1-1 draw also on Sunday.\n\nThey meet in Frankfurt at the Waldstadion where kickoff is at 6 pm local time (1600 GMT). Here's what to know about the match:\n\nAlso Read | IND vs AFG Dream11 Team Prediction, ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Super Eight: Tips and Suggestions To Pick Best Winning Fantasy Playing XI for India vs Afghanistan in Barbados.\n\nDenmark's need for a win is greater, ahead of a final Group C game against a physically imposing Serbia team.\n\nThe teams renew their rivalry from a Euro 2020 semifinal played three years ago at Wembley Stadium. England won 2-1 after extra time, sealed when Harry Kane followed up his penalty being saved by Kasper Schmeichel to score when the ball rebounded to him.\n\nAlso Read | Richard Kettleborough, Richard Illingworth To Officiate Blockbuster India vs Australia Super Eight Match in ICC T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nDenmark did not easily forget how England got that decisive spot-kick, for a foul awarded against defender Joakim M\u00e6hle -- \"a penalty which should not have been a penalty,\" coach Kasper Hjulmand said then.\n\nThere is a familiarity between the squads with teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Brentford on either side of this game.\n\nGareth Southgate is coaching England at his fourth tournament and will be less troubled than analysts and fans about the manner of victory over Serbia. England eased its way through the group stage at Euro 2020 -- making at least two changes between each game -- did not concede a goal, then accelerated through the knockout rounds.\n\nSouthgate's main call could be if Trent Alexander-Arnold's long-range passing is retained in central midfield alongside Declan Rice. Recent debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton are options.\n\nEngland's preferred left back Luke Shaw is still not involved in team training, and Kieran Trippier is set to continue on his less favored flank.\n\nDenmark has reported no injury concerns.\n\nA draw can be a good result for Denmark even if it ends the day third in the standings. Slovenia plays Serbia in the earlier game Thursday. In two previous Euros with a 24-team tournament format -- which sends four of the six third-place teams to the knockout phase -- a team with three draws has done enough to advance.\n\nAnother England win would set the team up to win Group C and face a third-place team in the round of 16. The group runner-up will face the Group A winner, likely Germany, in the vibrant Dortmund stadium.\n\nHowever, England has never won two straight games to start a Euros tournament.\n\nDefender Simon Kjaer was an unused substitute against Slovenia and his Denmark record of 132 national-team games is now just one ahead of Christian Eriksen, who scored in that 1-1 draw.\n\n\"We see it every day in training here, and he's such a nice guy as well. You know he has high standards that he sets and expects,\" said England midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, 19, on star teammate Jude Bellingham, who turns 21 next week.\n\n\"Once the tournament starts you get into a rhythm. It came and we won it. So, we're confident now, we're happy,\" said England winger Bukayo Saka on winning the first game\n\n\"We have it in our power to have a fantastic game against England where nobody expects us to win,\" Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said.

Denmark was denied by Slovenia's late leveler in a 1-1 draw also on Sunday. They meet in Frankfurt at the Waldstadion where kickoff is at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT). Here's what to know about the match:\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Denmark's need for a win is greater, ahead of a final Group C game against a physically imposing Serbia team.\n\n-- The teams renew their rivalry from a Euro 2020 semifinal played three years ago at Wembley Stadium. England won 2-1 after extra time, sealed when Harry Kane followed up his penalty being saved by Kasper Schmeichel to score when the ball rebounded to him.\n\n-- Denmark did not easily forget how England got that decisive spot-kick, for a foul awarded against defender Joakim M\u00e6hle -- \"a penalty which should not have been a penalty,\" coach Kasper Hjulmand said then.\n\n-- Gareth Southgate is coaching England at his fourth tournament and will be less troubled than analysts and fans about the manner of victory over Serbia. England eased its way through the group stage at Euro 2020 -- making at least two changes between each game -- did not concede a goal, then accelerated through the knockout rounds.\n\n-- A draw can be a good result for Denmark even if it ends the day third in the standings. Slovenia plays Serbia in the earlier game Thursday. In two previous Euros with a 24-team tournament format -- which sends four of the six third-place teams to the knockout phase -- a team with three draws has done enough to advance.\n\n-- Another England win would set the team up to win Group C and face a third-place team in the round of 16. The group runner-up will face the Group A winner, likely Germany, in the vibrant Dortmund stadium.\n\n-- However, England has never won two straight games to start a Euros tournament.\n\n-- \"We see it every day in training here, and he's such a nice guy as well. You know he has high standards that he sets and expects.\" -- England midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, 19, on star teammate Jude Bellingham, who turns 21 next week\n\n-- \"Once the tournament starts you get into a rhythm. It came and we won it. So, we're confident now, we're happy.\" -- England winger Bukayo Saka on winning the first game\n\n-- \"We have it in our power to have a fantastic game against England where nobody expects us to win.\" -- Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion_(Frankfurt)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waldstadion (Frankfurt)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_M\u00e6hle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joakim M\u00e6hle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Slovenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Slovenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/30mepWlUcd6BfOxxHnUABw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp_sports_913/a6e95deb5151467dcc02ac37ecc68e4c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

On this evidence, it was the understatement of Euro 2024 so far.\n\nGareth Southgate can highlight the point, which moved England closer to the job done territory of qualification for the last 16. It must be said there is precious little jeopardy around that. Who exactly does not advance?\n\nRelated: Denmark 1-1 England: Euro 2024 - live reaction\n\nThe jeopardy was to be found in the England performance. They might have nicked the win, Phil Foden hitting a post in the second half; a few other assorted flickers. And, equally, they might have lost because Denmark had their chances. There was a last-ditch quality to some of England's defending and when Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg shaped a curler for the far corner in the 85 minute, England's hearts were in their mouths. The shot was off target.\n\nEngland lacked structure in midfield, progressive patterns, with all three of Southgate's starters here - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham - enduring difficult games. The manager raised eyebrows when he withdrew his front three of Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane and Foden on 70 minutes, although Jarrod Bowen, Ollie Watkins and Eberechi Eze did bring something in their places.\n\nFor England, the control was not there. The hope had been when Kane put them ahead that they could settle but they did not. There was a frenetic feel to the occasion and Denmark were good value for the draw, secured by Morten Hjulmand's scorching 30-yard drive just after the half hour.\n\nFollowing the 1-0 win over Serbia on Sunday, which had featured a second-half retreat, this was a backwards step for England. The hope remains that they can put their problems behind them and grow into a tournament that they started as one of the favourites. Who was buying that here?\n\nSouthgate had wanted to play better than against Serbia, although that did not apply to the opening 30 minutes of that game when England passed and moved sharply. The idea was to make another assured start with the same XI, Southgate keeping the faith, seeking to finesse the tournament bonds.\n\nIt did not happen. The truth was that England were ragged at the outset, making errors, too many loose passes. There was a lack of cohesion when it mattered on the ball while it also looked as though a few of Southgate's players had problems with the turf, which cut up badly.\n\nKyle Walker was one of them, slipping over twice, rolling his ankle on the second occasion, which looked bad. Fortunately he was able to continue, changing his boots before he re-entered. Walker would be key to the move for the breakthrough goal.\n\nQuite how Victor Kristiansen, the Denmark left wing-back, was unaware of Walker stealing up on his outside was a mystery. Maybe it was because shouts from teammates amid the remorseless din under the closed roof of his excellent stadium were impossible.\n\nBut Kristiansen did not see him as he pondered a backpass and, when Walker robbed him, England felt the surge of possibility. Their luck was in, Walker's low cross, seemingly intended for Foden, deflecting first off Jannik Vestergaard and then Andreas Christensen to break perfectly for Kane. It was a done deal at that point.\n\nDenmark did not panic. They had given up a couple of flickers at 0-0, Foden slipping away from H\u00f8jberg after a Walker cut-back only to shoot wildly; Kane seeing a shot blocked after Rice had won the ball high up. But it was Denmark who looked the more joined up in the first half, more dangerous.\n\nIt was worrying to see how much space they were able to enjoy in between the lines, England's midfield looking open against the ball. Denmark pushed, England forced to defend with a degree of desperation.\n\nThere were an alarming number of situations where England had no options on the ball and Kane was guilty of trying to force a crossfield pass from tight on the left inside his own half on the Denmark equaliser. It went straight to Kristiansen and when he moved it to Hjulmand, he detonated his rocket, watching the ball glance in off Jordan Pickford's right-hand spot. The power and precision were extraordinary.\n\nFoden would slice past a couple of challengers on 41 minutes only to ignore Kane and shoot weakly and England were the happier to hear the half-time whistle. Hjulmand had found room around the edge of the England area - his shot was blocked - while H\u00f8jbjerg shot too close to Pickford.\n\nSouthgate made a move on 54 minutes, introducing Conor Gallagher for Alexander-Arnold, whose performance will deepen the debate about the balance of the England midfield with him in it. Before Alexander-Arnold went off, he had pumped a long ball forward for Saka, which the winger almost made something of, waiting for the bounce and looping a header just off target.\n\nEngland sought greater intensity, Gallagher helping, although he would tread a fine line after being booked for a stamp on Christensen. Foden almost gave them the lead with his best moment, a couple of touches followed by a rasping low drive from distance that rattled the upright.\n\nSouthgate made his triple change and Watkins would almost get in onto a Bellingham pass. The closing stages were frantic, Marc Gu\u00e9hi robbed by the substitute, Alexander Bah, after a bad Rice pass but racing back to make a crucial tackle. From the corner, Christensen went close and so did H\u00f8jbjerg shortly afterwards.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Emile_H\u00f8jbjerg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Bah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Christensen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Christensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Vestergaard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Vestergaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/3c7747e4b6be96119b934ff00213a6ba", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Harry Kane handed England a 1-0 lead early in the first half. However, a precise long-range effort from Morten Hjulmand made it 1-1 for the Danes. England struck the post in the second half in what was overall a sloppy performance from Gareth Southgate's men.\n\nIn what was a tentative start, both sides lacked the killer instinct in the first 15 minutes. Phil Foden missed a presentable chance after doing everything right. It was Kane, who scored for England on a dodgy pitch. Kyle Walker put a low ball across the six-yard box and Kane made no mistake. Credit to Walker for catching out Kristiansen, who was sleeping.\n\nDenmark grew into the game since going behind and asked England questions. It was Kane, who gave the ball away cheaply as his pass was cut out. Kristiansen moved the ball across midfield. Hjulmand received the ball and hit it cleanly. His long-range stunner beat a diving Jordan Pickford. England paid the price for being sloppy as they switched off. Denmark ended strongly.\n\nEngland's midfield was an issue in the first half. Declan Rice and Trent Alexander-Arnold were sitting too deep with Jude Bellingham literally having no say in an advanced role. Denmark found joy in the middle of the pitch. Notably, the Danes had 17 touches in the opposition box compared to England's four. They also had four shots on target and made nine attempts.\n\nAs per Opta, Kane is only the third player to score in four separate major tournaments for England (2018 World Cup, Euro 2020, 2022 World Cup, Euro 2024), after Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. Making his 93rd appearance in all competitions for England, Kane now owns 64 goals.

He's not to blame for this dismal showing, however.\n\nRead More Woeful England lacked fluency, confidence and cohesion in 1-1 draw with Denmark, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nKyle Walker 6\n\nCredit for his awareness in making the steal from a sleeping opponent before creating Kane's goal with a deflected cross, but he did not get forward nowhere near as much as he should and can. He had a shaky start and needed a change of boots, and he was OK defensively.\n\nJohn Stones 6\n\nWe did not see any of the ball-playing ability he showcases for Manchester City, but maybe that was because if he stepped into midfield he would have been met with his own midfielders on his toes! He was pinned in by own team at times and had to worry more about what was coming at him from those in red.\n\nJordan Pickford (pictured) had to make a lot of saves considering how much of the ball Denmark had\n\nKyle Walker (pictured) proved pivtoal in helping England get their opener but he did not get forward nowhere near as much as he should and can\n\nWe did not see any of the ball-playing ability John Stones (left) showcases for Man City\n\nMarc Guehi (right) recovered well to produce an excellent tackle to stop Alexander Bah's (left) cross\n\nMarc Guehi 6\n\nHe had done well but then almost ruined a steady display with a slip to allow Bah to run clear. He recovered to make the tackle, but as much because the Denmark forward was slow. He then lost his man from the resulting corner. Those moments apart, he can be satisfied enough.\n\nRead More Kyle Walker reveals what Gareth Southgate has told England to do when they're leading 1-0\n\nKieran Trippier 6.5\n\nEngland needed him with a couple of big interventions in the moments after Kane's goal. He played most of the game without anyone in front of him either, given how much Foden vacated his position on the left. A solid showing on and off the ball and just about England's best - even if that was the best of a bad bunch.\n\nDeclan Rice 4.5\n\nWill not be happy by the manner in which he lost the ball on several occasions. At one point he blamed Bellingham for not offering an option, but Rice needs to look closer to home. By his standards, this was a very poor performance, and it looked like he knew it.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's (centre) midfield experiment doesn't seem to quite be working\n\nDeclan Rice (pictured) had a poor performance by his standards and will not be happy with how often he lost the ball\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold 4\n\nThis must be the end of the midfield experiment. You can't blame the player, he's not a midfielder! He was hooked after 54 minutes after a performance in which he gave the ball away far too often and went AWOL as Denmark took control. His head was clearly gone after half-time.\n\nRead More James McClean hits out at Declan Rice again as he criticises the England midfielder's performance\n\nBukayo Saka 5\n\nNowhere near the level of danger he posed against Serbia. He did not play badly, but nor did he do much good. With plenty of alternatives in wide areas, he has to do more than this. Like others, his energy in the press to disturb the Danes was not there.\n\nJude Bellingham 5\n\nFrom Roy of the Rovers to Doncaster Rovers, the man-of-the-match from Serbia was a shadow of the star from Sunday. He didn't win his duels and was all too rarely on the ball. When he did have it he kept onto it for too long and did not populate the box like he did in the opening game. He did well not to be substituted.\n\nJude Bellingham (pictured) failed to live up to his Man of the Match display against Serbia\n\nBukayo Saka (centre) lacked energy in the press and failed to show the same level of attacking threat he had shown against Serbia\n\nPhil Foden (centre) had good moments but again looked uncomfortable on the left wing\n\nPhil Foden 6\n\nOut of position on the left wing, again, every time he impacted it was when drifting inside, at times even right of centre in midfield. He had good moments, two good runs followed by poor finishes and another when he cracked post, but he cannot continue in a position he does not want to play. It's detrimental to the team.\n\nHarry Kane 4.5\n\nRight place to pounce for opener but then gifted possession to Danes for equaliser with baffling cross-field ball - he did not look where it was going. Dropped so deep but was unable to press opponents. Looked off it, like against Serbia, and was rightly withdrawn when impact had waned to zero.\n\nDespite his goal, Kane (pictured) underwhelmed and was brought off after half-time\n\nConor Gallagher (front right) came on as a substitute for Trent Alexander-Arnold after half-time\n\nAston Villa forward Ollie Watkins (pictured) would make his first Euro 2024 appearance, coming on for Kane\n\nGareth Southgate (left) had no answers, his substitutes didn't work and he failed to learn from the errors his side made during their game vs Serbia\n\nSubstitutes\n\nConor Gallagher (on for Alexander-Arnold, 54) 5.5\n\nEberechi Eze (on for Foden 69) 5\n\nJarrod Bowen (on for Saka 69) 5\n\nOllie Watkins (on for Kane 69) 5\n\nManager - Gareth Southgate 4\n\nWasn't this performance everything for which Southgate has been criticised? A team packed full of attacking talent taking the lead and then retreating so deep to invite pressure and an inevitable equaliser.\n\nHe had no answers - his four changes did not work - and the manager best wear a crash helmet during the fallout from this dismal display.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

England won 2-1 after extra time, sealed when Harry Kane followed up his penalty being saved by Kasper Schmeichel to score when the ball rebounded to him.\n\n-- Denmark did not easily forget how England got that decisive spot-kick, for a foul awarded against defender Joakim M\u00e6hle -- \"a penalty which should not have been a penalty,\" coach Kasper Hjulmand said then. Hjulmand said Wednesday he's not thinking about that incident anymore, preferring to look at the next game \"through the front window.\"\n\n-- There is a familiarity between the squads with teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Brentford on either side of this game.\n\n-- Gareth Southgate is coaching England at his fourth tournament and will be less troubled than analysts and fans about the manner of victory over Serbia. England eased its way through the group stage at Euro 2020 -- making at least two changes between each game -- did not concede a goal, then accelerated through the knockout rounds.\n\n-- Southgate's main call could be if Trent Alexander-Arnold's long-range passing is retained in central midfield alongside Declan Rice. Recent debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton are options.\n\n-- England's preferred left back Luke Shaw is still not involved in team training, and Kieran Trippier should continue on his less favored flank.\n\n-- Denmark has reported no injury concerns with defender Simon Kjaer, its captain at Euro 2020, fit to return.\n\n-- A draw can be a good result for Denmark even if it ends the day third in the standings. Slovenia plays Serbia in the earlier game Thursday. In two previous Euros with a 24-team tournament format -- which sends four of the six third-place teams to the knockout phase -- a team with three draws has done enough to advance.\n\n-- Another England win would set the team up to win Group C and face a third-place team in the round of 16. The group runner-up will face the Group A winner, likely Germany, in the vibrant Dortmund stadium.\n\n-- However, England has never won two straight games to start a Euros tournament.\n\n-- Denmark's Kjaer was an unused substitute against Slovenia and his Denmark record of 132 national-team games is now just one ahead of Christian Eriksen, who scored in that 1-1 draw.\n\n-- \"We see it every day in training here, and he's such a nice guy as well. You know he has high standards that he sets and expects.\" -- England midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, 19, on star teammate Jude Bellingham, who turns 21 next week.\n\n-- \"Once the tournament starts you get into a rhythm. It came and we won it. So, we're confident now, we're happy.\" -- England winger Bukayo Saka on winning the first game.\n\n-- \"Are we favorites? No. Is it a failure if we don't win the Euros?

The goal draws him level with Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as the players to score for England at the most major tournaments, with four apiece.\n\nDenmark were the better team after that, however, and an equaliser felt inevitable. The Danes capitalised on England's sloppy play in the 34th minute when Kane's pass up the field from a throw-in went to Kristiansen, who passed to Hjulmand. The 24-year-old launched a rocket from about 30 yards out that ricocheted off the left post and into the net.\n\nEngland keeper Jordan Pickford barely saw it coming, and waved a frustrated finger at his teammates.\n\nDenmark were the sharper team thereafter, as their midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg appeared to acknowledge afterwards.\n\n\"I would have traded it for three points,\" he said of his man of the match award. \"We played well, we played smart, annoying that we couldn't get one to go in. We have a lot we can take with us, we have to keep looking ahead and do it, we have time.\"\n\nLooking to inject some fresh legs and energy, Southgate took off Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka with about 20 minutes to play and replaced them with Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze.\n\nBoth teams squandered chances, however, the narrowest miss coming from Foden, who rang a shot off the post in the second half in a far more lively performance from him on Thursday than in the Serbia game.\n\nJude Bellingham, who scored England's lone goal in their 1-0 opening win against Serbia in a dazzling first-half performance, barely factored on Thursday.\n\nThe Frankfurt Arena turf, which drew complaints after an earlier game, was no help to either team and was eventually torn to shreds. England's Walker had to change his boots early on after sliding on it and rolling his ankle.\n\nEngland take on Slovenia in their final group game on Tuesday, while the Danes take on Serbia on the same day, with all four teams still technically able to progress in the tournament depending on the results.", "source": {"uri": "onmanorama.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OnManorama"},

While the Three Lions have come out on top 13 times, Denmark have registered just four victories, with the remaining five games all ending as a draw.\n\nThe very first meeting between these two European nations took place back in September 1948 when they played out a goalless friendly stalemate at a neutral venue in Norway.\n\nEight years later, Denmark and England locked horns for their first competitive encounter in World Cup qualifying, with the Three Lions following up a 5-2 home victory with a 4-1 success in the reverse fixture five months later.\n\nThose two victories were part of a six-match winning streak for England against Denmark, but the latter eventually celebrated their first triumph over the Three Lions in September 1983, with Allan Simonsen's first-half penalty securing a narrow 1-0 win at Wembley Stadium in European Championship qualifying.\n\nDenmark and England shared the spoils in a 0-0 draw during the group stage of Euro 1992, a competition the Danes famously triumphed in having qualified only after Yugoslavia were barred due to the developing Balkan crisis.\n\nSince the turn of the century, England have won four of their eight meetings with Denmark, including a comfortable 3-0 victory in the last 16 of the 2002 World Cup, courtesy of a Thomas Sorensen own goals and strikes from Michael Owen and Emile Heskey.\n\nDenmark got their revenge, though, with two friendly wins by an aggregate score of 7-3 between 2003 and 2005, before England matches that with two friendly victories of their own in 2011 (2-1) and 2014 (1-0).\n\nThe most recent three meetings between these two nations have all been competitive ones, including back-to-back encounters in the UEFA Nations League, with Denmark holding England to a 0-0 draw on home soil in September 2020 before securing a narrow 1-0 away victory at Wembley 13 months later, thanks to a first-half penalty from Christian Eriksen.\n\nEngland and Denmark last locked horns in the semi-finals of Euro 2020, with the Three Lions edging through to their first major tournament final for 55 years after claiming a 2-1 win after extra time at Wembley. Mikkel Damsgaard's superb free-kick was cancelled out by an unfortunate Simon Kjaer own goal, before Harry Kane slotted home the match-winner in the 104th minute after having his initially penalty

2024 success despite their lacklustre display in Thursday's 1-1 draw against Denmark.\n\nGareth Southgate's side would have qualified for the last 16 as Group C winners if they had defeated the Danes in Frankfurt.\n\nEngland captain Kane gave them the perfect start with a clinical close-range finish from Kyle Walker's deflected cross in the 18th minute.\n\nBut England lost their momentum after that and Denmark drew level after 34 minutes when Morten Hjulmand blasted a superb 30-yard drive past Jordan Pickford.\n\nIt was hardly the kind of display that will strike fear into England's rivals, with the incoherent effort coming after they were fortunate to escape with a 1-0 win against Serbia in their group opener last weekend.\n\nBut Bayern Munich striker Kane is adamant England will eventually fire on all cylinders.\n\n\"I think we said before the tournament there's no easy games and I think that's showing,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got levels we can reach and we can be better both with and without the ball.\n\n\"The sign of a good team is when you're not playing at your best and still find a way to get results like we have in the last two games.\"\n\nEngland are still on course to reach the last 16 as they sit top of the group with four points heading into their last game against Slovenia.\n\nBut they will want to win the group, which would likely ensure an easier draw in the last 16.\n\nFormer England players including Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand were scathing in their criticism of the Three Lions' latest limp showing in Germany.", "source": {"uri":

"Five things we learned from England's 1-1 draw against Denmark at Euro 2024, Arsenal star impresses again but Man City ace struggles", "body": "England drew 1-1 against Denmark in Germany in their second game of the European Championships at the Frankfurt Arena.\n\nGareth Southgate's side struck first in the first half thanks to a tap in from Harry Kane, for his first goal at this summer's competition.\n\nDenmark, however, weren't giving up without a fight and struck 35 minutes into the game through a stunning goal from Morten Hjulmand.\n\nAfter England switched off for a second, the Sporting Lisbon midfielder struck a beauty from 30 yards out which went in off the post.\n\nIt wouldn't be a major tournament for Southgate's England without a goal from Kane.\n\nAfter failing to really get involved in the opening game against Serbia, Kane was right in the thick of things here as he netted from close range in the first half.\n\nAfter good work from Kyle Walker on the right, he cut the ball back to Bukayo Saka, but the ball eventually found it's way to Kane who had an easy tap in.\n\nThat was tournament goal number 13 for Kane and his 63rd for the national team.\n\nAfter the England goal, Southgate's side, once again, seemed to drop off and go into their shell which allowed their opponents to grow in confidence.\n\nAfter a dispossession in the middle of the park, Sporting Lisbon midfielder Hjulmand took a couple of touches before firing into the corner.\n\nEverton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had no chance with the effort which was the first goal that the Three Lions have conceded in the group stage of a major tournament since Gareth Bale's freekick in 2016.\n\nManchester City midfielder Phil Foden won the Premier League Player Of The Year award and looked set to be in for a key tournament in Germany.\n\nHowever, so far after two group games for England, Foden has looked invisible off the left and Southgate has to make a decision on the City midfielder.\n\nFoden's qualities are clear but the Englishman cannot continue to play off the left as this seems to stifle the Three Lions.\n\nThere has been much debate about Trent Alexander-Arnold's position in the team with Southgate choosing to play the Liverpool defender in the middle of the park.\n\nAfter a poor showing against Serbia, the Liverpool man was kept in the same role for the game against Denmark but it just did not work.\n\nDeclan Rice would drop deep and Alexander-Arnold looked like he didn't know what he was meant to be doing in the middle of the park.\n\nSouthgate has options to change things and it is vital that he does so going forward in the tournament.\n\nThroughout the game, Denmark were pressing as a team and on multiple occasions did not allow the Three Lions out of their own half.\n\nAs for England, the press looks disjointed and Harry Kane was struggling, despite netting the games opening goal.\n\nIt was certainly a surprise to see Kane get substituted for Ollie Watkins on the 70 minute mark but it was the right decision made by Southgate.\n\nEngland take on Slovenia in their final group game on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com",

Kevin Keegan scored twice inside 21 minutes but Denmark were soon level courtesy of an Allan Simonsen penalty and a goal from Frank Arnesen.\n\nEngland regained their two-goal lead in the second half thanks to Bob Latchford and Phil Neal but just 13 seconds after England's fourth goal, Per Rontved got one back for Denmark. Despite this, England managed to hold on for the victory.\n\nDenmark 0 England 3 (World Cup 2002 round of 16, June 2002)\n\nRio Ferdinand celebrates after England beat Denmark (Rui Vieira/PA)\n\nEngland reached the quarter-finals of World Cup 2002 after ultimately beating Denmark in the first half with three goals without reply.\n\nRio Ferdinand got England up and running after netting inside the first five minutes, then a 22-year-old Michael Owen doubled the lead in the 22nd minute.\n\nJust before half-time, Emile Heskey joined the party with a goal to give Sven-Goran Eriksson's side a healthy lead going into the second half, which produced no further goals.\n\nDenmark 4 England 1 (friendly, August 2005)\n\nA friendly in the summer of 2005 saw Denmark comfortably beat England in Copenhagen. Denmark scored three goals in eight second-half minutes through Dennis Rommedahl, Jon Dahl Tomasson and Michael Gravgaard.\n\nEngland managed to get one back in the 87th minute thanks to Wayne Rooney, however this was merely a consolation as in the second minute of added time Soren Larsen scored Denmark's fourth.\n\nEngland 2 Denmark 1 (Euro 2020 semi-final, July 2021)\n\nGareth Southgate's side kept their Euro 2020 hopes alive by making their way into the final after overcoming a resilient Denmark side.\n\nIt was not simple for England as in the 30th minute Mikkel Damsgaard stuck a powerful free-kick into the top-left corner, leaving a flailing Jordan Pickford with no chance and putting the Danes 1-0 up.\n\nSoon after, England were back level after an own goal from a low Bukayo Saka cross was bundled in by an unlucky Simon Kjaer.\n\nEngland kept pushing but they could not beat Kasper Schmeichel until the 104th minute when Harry Kane followed in his saved penalty and made sure not to miss the rebound, sending England to the final.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

These are two teams with points on the board in Group C but with room for improvement. They also know each other pretty well.\n\nThis Euro 2024 match kicks off from the Waldstadion at 6 p.m. local time Thursday, June 20, in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nHere's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe:\n\nLuke Shaw continued to train away from his team-mates as he builds match fitness, so the game in Frankfurt comes too soon for the Manchester United left-back to start.\n\nGareth Southgate could stick with an unchanged XI from the Serbia game, giving the Trent Alexander-Arnold midfield experiment another chance to bed in. Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo appeared as substitutes at the weekend and are the most likely alternatives to the Liverpool star.\n\nEngland projected starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Pickford (GK) -- Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier -- Alexander-Arnold, Rice -- Saka, Bellingham, Foden -- Kane.\n\nKasper Hjulmand could similarly field an unchanged side, although Joakim Maehle could provide an attacking outlet at wing-back.\n\nManchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has seven goals in 15 international caps and will lead the line for his country once more.\n\nDenmark projected starting lineup (3-4-1-2): Schmeichel (GK) -- Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard -- Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen -- Eriksen -- Wind, Hojlund.\n\nHere's how to watch this Euro 2024 match across selected areas of the world's major regions:\n\nUSA: England vs. Denmark from the Waldstadion will be televised in the United States on FOX, with a Spanish-language broadcast via Vix.

Overall, we've got to look back and see where we can improve.\"\n\nKane went on to acknowledge that England are also shaky in possession at times too, adding: \"We're struggling with and without the ball.\n\n\"We'll have to go away and look at it back, but the pressure hasn't been quite right in both games, and we haven't been good enough with the ball top to bottom, that's me all the way back to [Jordan] Pickford.\n\n\"We're dropping below our level in terms of retaining the ball and playing under pressure.\n\n\"We know we can improve. There'll be a lot of noise, a bit of disappointment back home, but we experienced this when we drew to Scotland in the last Euros. The sign of a good team is to find results when you're not playing your best.\"\n\nFor Southgate's part, he understood why fans would be frustrated with performances in the opening two games, and added that his team must find another level.\n\nHe told BBC Sport: \"Clearly it wasn't what we would've hoped. We're not using the ball well enough and have to accept if you do that you're going to suffer at times as we have tonight. We know there's another level we're going to have to find.\n\n\"We've played teams who are quite fluid in back threes, it's not easy to get pressure on them, but we've definitely got to do it better than we have in these two matches.\n\n\"That's been part of the problem, but not keeping the ball has also been a big part of the problem.\"\n\n\"There's a huge amount of work, that's evident from the performances we've given. We have to stay tight, we understand people will be disappointed with the performances - and rightly so. We've got to make them better.\"\n\nSky Sports' Nick Wright:\n\nThe result was different but there were obvious parallels with the Serbia game. Once again, a bright start was rewarded with an early goal. Once again, it was followed by the team ceding the initiative and sinking deeper and deeper into their own half.\n\nThis tendency to invite pressure is not new. It has been a curious feature of Gareth Southgate's tenure. But mostly it has occurred in knockout games against the big nations. Not in group-stage fixtures against sides sitting outside the top 20 in the FIFA rankings.\n\nIt is baffling that a group of players as good as this, a group regarded as favourites to win the tournament, can end up playing like an underdog in games such as these but that is the reality of what they served up, first against Serbia and now against Denmark.\n\nOf course, that is not to say these are easy fixtures. Tournament football can be unforgiving. But the Denmark game was just the latest in which England have invited problems by inviting pressure. It led to Denmark's leveller and it could have been worse.\n\nThe statistics were alarming. Denmark, in addition to outshooting England, made slightly more passes and had slightly more of the ball. But consider, too, where they had it compared to England. Denmark had 22 touches in the opposition box to England's 11. They made 142 passes in the final third to England's 97.\n\nIt is not as though England lack the personnel to play higher up the pitch. In Kyle Walker and the excellent Marc Guehi, they have quick defenders able to sweep up behind a high line.

This was a questionable decision as Serbia bested the Three Lions for the best part of 50 minutes. That meant that match winner Jude Bellingham retained his spot as the ten, with Harry Kane ahead of him and Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden either side. It initially appeared that Denmark might take the same route as Serbia as they lined up with a flat back five - but the game was far more open from the off. Some Denmark mistakes made it look like an easier task for England to progress that ball into the final third, which is what led to their opening goal as some dedicated work from Kyle Walker led to the ball falling kindly to Harry Kane to bag his first of the tournament. Denmark started to make use of the ball and work their way back into the game. The equaliser came from a world class long ranged strike from the midfield, and England looked shaky going into half time. 1-1 at the break.\n\nEngland came out lethargically after a 15 minute telling off session, with a long shot from Declan Rice all they could muster in the first five minutes. Bukayo Saka headed just wide moments later but frustrations were still evidently high. Phil Foden hit the post cleanly as things started to improve, before Saka shot way wide on the break. Denmark came lose via a couple of long ranged strikes, before England made various changes. Ollie Watkins came in and tested the keeper early on as he provided a different kind of outlet for Jude Bellingham to find with his runs in behind. It was becoming more apparent by the second that many of the England players were not on the same page as each other. Marc Gu\u00e9hi made a mistake to let Denmark in, but to his credit recovered to stop the opposition from capitalising. Two chances later for the Danes, and the British fans were starting to sweat. Other than one or two moments of quality, Jude Bellingham had a quiet game. Still, he was not alone as it was another disappointing performance for England. 1-1 at full time, bringing the points tally up to 4. This should see them through to the knock-out phase. England finalise their group stage campaign on Tuesday against Slovakia, and at some point will need to improve.", "source": {"uri": "managingmadrid.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Managing Madrid"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_sharpe@managingmadrid.com", "name": "Sam Sharpe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lNCAGM_RfWOtV2KszY7vw1Fu1T4=/0x0:3000x1500/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25499343/2158002316.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

While the Three Lions have come out on top 13 times, Denmark have registered just four victories, with the remaining five games all ending as a draw.\n\nThe very first meeting between these two European nations took place back in September 1948 when they played out a goalless friendly stalemate at a neutral venue in Norway.\n\nEight years later, Denmark and England locked horns for their first competitive encounter in World Cup qualifying, with the Three Lions following up a 5-2 home victory with a 4-1 success in the reverse fixture five months later.\n\nThose two victories were part of a six-match winning streak for England against Denmark, but the latter eventually celebrated their first triumph over the Three Lions in September 1983, with Allan Simonsen's first-half penalty securing a narrow 1-0 win at Wembley Stadium in European Championship qualifying.\n\nDenmark and England shared the spoils in a 0-0 draw during the group stage of Euro 1992, a competition the Danes famously triumphed in having qualified only after Yugoslavia were barred due to the developing Balkan crisis.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nSince the turn of the century, England have won four of their eight meetings with Denmark, including a comfortable 3-0 victory in the last 16 of the 2002 World Cup, courtesy of a Thomas Sorensen own goals and strikes from Michael Owen and Emile Heskey.\n\nDenmark got their revenge, though, with two friendly wins by an aggregate score of 7-3 between 2003 and 2005, before England matches that with two friendly victories of their own in 2011 (2-1) and 2014 (1-0).\n\nThe most recent three meetings between these two nations have all been competitive ones, including back-to-back encounters in the UEFA Nations League, with Denmark holding England to a 0-0 draw on home soil in September 2020 before securing a narrow 1-0 away victory at Wembley 13 months later, thanks to a first-half penalty from Christian Eriksen.\n\nEngland and Denmark last locked horns in the semi-finals of Euro 2020, with the Three Lions edging through to their first major tournament final for 55 years after claiming a 2-1 win after extra time at Wembley. Mikkel Damsgaard's superb free-kick was cancelled out by an unfortunate Simon Kjaer own goal, before Harry Kane slotted home the match-winner in the 104th minute after having his initially penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nPrevious 10 meetings\n\nJul 07, 2021: England 2-1 Denmark (Euro 2020 Semi-Finals)\n\nOct 14, 2020: England 0-1 Denmark (UEFA Nations League League A)\n\nSep 08, 2020:

Manager Gareth Southgate made several decisions that ultimately backfired. England remain top of Group C but will need to improve dramatically in order to win the tournament.\n\nEngland were held to a sluggish 1-1 draw against Denmark on Thursday night. An early goal by Harry Kane brought hope among the Three Lions that they could forget last Sunday's close shave with Serbia, but Gareth Southgate's side lacked energy and ideas to kick on, allowing the Danes to find a way back into the fixture.\n\nAfter Slovenia and Serbia also drew in the earlier Euro 2024 kickoff, England had the chance to qualify early for the knockout rounds, but changes are needed by Southgate - and fast. A final Group C tie against bottom-placed Slovenia on Tuesday night awaits, but there are three things the manager will want to focus on in his post-match reflection first.\n\nRelated England 1-1 Denmark: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nEngland were off the boil as Denmark were left unlucky to draw in their Euro 2024 clash.\n\nSitting Back After Scoring England needed to kick on after early goal\n\nIn a tournament where so many early goals have been scored, it was critical for England to kick on after Harry Kane opened his Euro 2024 account in the 18th minute. But in a repeat of last weekend's tale against Serbia, they appeared to drop off and retreat, soaking up pressure and allowing Denmark to find a way back into the game, scoring the equaliser in the 34th minute before looking the likeliest to find a winner.\n\nEngland's history of sitting back after scoring a goal is a well-noted pattern in football, and it made an unwelcome appearance in Frankfurt. Below shows the average positioning of each England player before the goal compared to afterward, and the results make for worrying reading for those hoping the Three Lions can finally bring football home.\n\nConor Gallagher, Eberechi Eze and Ollie Watkins all came on and helped them re-energise late on, but it was too little too late for England, who ran out of ideas once Denmark had found their feet. Anthony Gordon possesses the necessary pace to ensure heads don't drop and opposition defences always have something to think about, but was an unused player on Thursday evening.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic : Denmark had more shot attempts (16-12), shots on goal (7-4) and more possession (50.9%-49.1%) than England.\n\nNot Changing The Line-Up After Serbia Game The problems were there for all to see before kick-off\n\nAlthough changing a winning team is usually the least effective strategy to undertake, with the famous quote suggesting \"If it isn't broken, don't fix it\" becoming a stereotypical managerial saying in such circumstances, it would probably have been better for Southgate to have tweaked a few things following a scrappy, close call 1-0 victory over Serbia last week.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it appeared obvious that there were cracks to be plastered after the first group fixture. Trent Alexander-Arnold appears less like a midfielder in each competitive fixture he plays for England, while Phil Foden - who was unable to complete any dribbles or create any chances against Serbia - was isolated when shoved out on the left flank.\n\nYet, while these two glaring problems were discernible to everyone else, the same starting line-up were handed their shirts back by Southgate in an attempt to help those who underperformed to exorcise their demons and vindicate the faith he had in his players to make a difference.\n\nThe result had the opposite effect, however, with both aforementioned players struggling to make an impact in their unchartered positions. Seemingly, Southgate sees the positives of having both Alexander-Arnold and Foden start together, but when put into practice, it just appears as though the manager is shoehorning reputable players into a system not fit for winning the European Championships. This helps construct a perfect segue into the final point.\n\nLack of Midfield Energy Foden, Rice, and Bellingham could form midfield three\n\nAhead of this year's tournament, Southgate was praised for ditching his old-fangled ways of putting dull, defensive strategies ahead of the attacking, experimental outlook of other coaches at his level. He was finally starting Alexander-Arnold, and his loyalty to players such as Kalvin Phillips and Eric Dier had been depleted, availing the England manager of a new, avant-garde approach to the way the Three Lions set up.\n\nBut now, he finds himself under criticism for this very reason. With Alexander-Arnold never playing in midfield under Jurgen Klopp, and Foden playing his best football in the number 10 role, fans can now see the reasoning behind Pep Guardiola and Klopp's decision to play these talented stars where they did.\n\nAs a result, England looked lethargic, particularly in the midfield areas. With both Rice and Alexander-Arnold being too far away from Jude Bellingham; play was easily broken up by Denmark, and the Three Lions had a tendency to lose the ball through misplaced passes, often playing at a pace that would suit the walking version of the sport.\n\nOne such way of combatting this is by Southgate continuing his experimental lineups, but with Foden starting as the 10 and Bellingham slotting into Alexander-Arnold's number 8 role.

A slightly different style of game, so they'll pose us different questions,\" said Southgate. \"We have to use the ball as we did in the first half [against Serbia], really, and we'll need to look back at their game and see whether there are any adjustments to what we need to do.\"\n\nUnlike England, Denmark was not able to make their first-half marker stand up as they were held to a 1-1 draw against Slovenia.\n\nChristian Eriksen, making his triumphant return to the European Championship after suffering a cardiac arrest in Denmark's opener at UEFA Euro 2020, found the net in the 17th minute to put his side ahead.\n\nUnfortunately, a deflected shot beat Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in the 77th minute and they were forced to settle for a point.\n\n\"Sometimes when you're up 1-0 and don't score the second goal, something happens in you,\" said Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand. \"That's why it's so important to get the second, and you know football. When you don't score the second goal, some disappointing things can happen.\"\n\nDenmark will be looking for more than just a response from their opening draw.\n\nThis contest is a rematch of the UEFA Euro 2020 semifinal where England eliminated Denmark 2-1 on a Harry Kane extra-time goal scored after he missed on a penalty.\n\n\"I would be lying if I said I hadn't thought about what might have been that night,\" Denmark defender Jannik Vestergaard said when asked about the rematch of the semifinal loss. \"There is still some bitterness.

In both matches, they failed to build on early first goals.\n\nRegardless of whether England secure passage to the knockout rounds in Germany, supporters will fear a repeat against the stronger opponents who await.\n\nAfter Harry Kane opened the scoring at Waldstadion, it immediately led to England's back four retreating towards their own penalty area. It was like they were playing 20 yards closer to Jordan Pickford's goal. When Morten Hjulmand levelled from long-range there were two centre-backs in their area. Gareth Southgate's backline should have been further up the pitch rather than inviting pressure. A touch map of the first half showed most of the action being in England's half, which was due to them dropping deeper. It was the same story in their Group C opener against Serbia only they managed to hold on for their win.\n\nPhil Foden had two good chances from the edge of the area and both were from a central No10 role. They were among the more positive moves of the first half but England do lose balance when he drifts inside. At one point he chased a ball across to the other flank and Denmark were able to switch play. England needed to be tighter as a midfield three. Jude Bellingham was playing further forward than Declan Rice and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Denmark were having joy playing through England with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Hjulmand exploiting space.\n\nWhile under the cosh, there was a moment when Bukaya Saka had the chance to break but his counter-attack was very smartly halted by a tactical foul from a Dane. England needed to find their pacy attackers when they got on the ball, which is down to getting accurate passes out of defence and midfield once possession is won. Just before Alexander-Arnold came off he went on a powerful run through the middle and these counter-attacks relieved the pressure and put England back on top in the second half.\n\nSouthgate waited until the 54th minute before making changes and could have easily started making subs at half-time. He has faith in his 4-2-3-1 system but Conor Gallagher, his first replacement, is a different type of player to Alexander-Arnold, adding plenty of energy but losing the range of passing of the Liverpool midfielder. Some on the bench such as Eberechi Eze or Anthony Gordon could have been given a chance - just a change of legs to ask the Danes a different question.\n\nWithin moments of the game resuming after Kane's goal we see a tactical theme that caused England problems throughout the half. Denmark's 5-4-1 defensive shape flipped into a 3-2-5 in attack when their wing-backs Victor Kristiansen and Joakim Maehle pushed forward. That front five stretched the pitch and out-numbered England's usual back four.\n\nIn reaction, Rice drops on to Denmark forward Jonas Wind to match their forward five. Kieran Trippier is reluctant to jump out to Maehle, which could have sparked Marc Guehi to jump to Wind and preserve England's shape. The result is a crater of space in midfield.\n\nDenmark looked to turn England around with long balls, from where they could pen Southgate's side in. A theme of England's opening two games is that when they were pushed back, they stayed back. In this instance, every England player bar Bellingham is camped in and around their own penalty area. Diligent defensive work to be sure, and in the Premier League we see high pressing teams crunch behind the ball when the time is right, but it made it difficult for England to escape.\n\nWhen Bukayo Saka hammers the ball clear, England have nobody contesting the first ball or even the second. It is simple for Denmark to recycle possession at start another attack. Southgate decided against picking one of England's best counter-attacking runners in Marcus Rashford, but does have Anthony Gordon and Ollie Watkins as options to fulfil this role. Tired legs after a long seasons makes springing attacks from deep even harder.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [],

Three of those will have come at the Euros, and one at the 2002 World Cup.\n\nDenmark and Gareth Southgate's England face off in a pivotal clash at Deutsche Bank Park on Thursday. A win for England would secure their spot in the UEFA Euro 2024 Round of 16. Ahead of the England vs Denmark clash, let us take a look at the predictions.\n\nAccording to the supercomputer, England are unsurprisingly favoured in this encounter with a 54.5% win probability, while Denmark's chances stand at 20.6%, with a draw considered likely at 25%. England boasts an exceptional squad on paper but has struggled to fully click as a cohesive unit on the international stage. Key figures like Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane possess the potential to be match-winners and will be crucial in determining England's success in this critical fixture. e at Insidesport.IN predict England to win the game 2-1.\n\nEngland got off to a winning start against Serbia, albeit with a performance that left room for improvement, marked by a narrow 1-0 victory. In their match against Serbia, England displayed a subdued attacking performance, managing only 12 touches in Serbia's box, their lowest in a European Championship game since 2012. The game saw a total of just 11 shots, with England's expected goals (xG) standing at a mere 0.54, despite registering three shots on target.\n\nJude Bellingham emerged as a pivotal figure for England against Serbia, scoring the decisive goal in the 13th minute. His influence extended across various facets of the game, leading England in touches (93) and ranking among the top passers with 77 successful attempts. Additionally, Bellingham engaged in 16 duels, winning 10 and successfully completing three tackles, showcasing his all-round contribution to the team's performance.\n\nFor Denmark, who currently sit second in Group C standings, the draw against Slovenia highlighted their need to elevate their game. They will be banking on talisman Christian Eriksen, who scored his first-ever goal in the European Championship during Denmark's opener, to pose a threat to England's defense.\n\nDespite Denmark's strong showing in reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2020, their recent group-stage record in Euros has been less impressive, with just one win in their last six group matches. Their challenge against England presents a crucial opportunity to assert themselves and enhance their prospects of advancing in the tournament.\n\nEngland Predicted XI:\n\nPickford; Walker, Stones,

None of the three previous meetings at major competitions have ended with the Danes victorious, indeed the Mikkel Damsgaard free kick with which they took the lead in the last meeting was the first tournament goal the Danes had scored against England.\n\nGoals were something of a precious commodity for both teams in their opening games but England's solitary strike proved to be enough to overcome Serbia a few hours after Denmark were held to a 1-1 draw with Slovenia. Those results mean that another win for Gareth Southgate's side would take them into the last 16 and may be enough to guarantee them top spot.

It was a more nervy game than it needed to be, a pre-tournament favorite holding on to Jude Bellingham's goal for 80 minutes when they had the talent to do so much more. Still England have previous in tournament football when it comes to grinding their way through games, trusting their defense to hold firm.\n\nDenmark weren't able to do that and will doubtless be loath to avoid a situation where they have to win their final game against Serbia having taken only a point from their first two games. \"We have to stick together,\" said Kasper Schmeichel. \"Any time you play a team with that much quality, you have to be able to stick together, defend well, and we have to take our chances when they come.\"\n\nTeam news\n\nDenmark: Simon Kjaer is in the running to figure, at least in some fashion, after missing the opening game with a thigh issue. \"It looks better and better,\" said head coach Kasper Hjulmand. \"He has had two fantastic training sessions.\" Joakim Maehle will hope to push his way into contention at wing back while Youssuf Poulsen's physicality could ask questions of Marc Guehi and John Stones that Jonas Wind might not.\n\nPossible Denmark XI: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Norgaard, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Hojlund, Poulsen\n\nEngland: Is more time needed to work out how Trent Alexander-Arnold's role in midfield? And what of Phil Foden, whose 35 caps have not really delivered the sort of stand out performance that was the norm with Manchester City last season? For now expect those two to keep their starting berth at a time when Luke Shaw may be hoping to feature off the bench.\n\nPossible England XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Alexander-Arnold, Rice; Saka, Bellingham, Foden; Kane\n\nPrediction\n\nThis could be another display where England leave their public wanting more but get the three points that really matter most.

Channel, start time and how to watch Euro 2024 fixture online tomorrow", "body": "The match is a replay of the Euro 2020 semi-final, when England squeezed past a spirited Danish side thanks to Harry Kane's rebound from a penalty.\n\nThe Three Lions earned a nervy three points against Serbia in their opening game, but with Slovenia and Denmark drawing the other match in Group C, it has put them in a strong position at the top of the group.\n\nDenmark were good value in their opening game, but will be disappointed to have thrown away a win after Christian Eriksen's dream opening goal. Nevertheless, the 1992 champions have a history of causing upsets in this competition, and they'll be hoping to do the same again in Frankfurt.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group C fixture.\n\nWhen is Denmark v England?\n\nThe match will kick off at 5pm BST on Thursday 20 June at the Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nDenmark vs England will be shown live on BBC One and iPlayer, with coverage starting at 4pm.

Viewers using a VPN need to make sure that they comply with any local regulations where they are, and also with the terms of their service provider.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nEngland have no fresh injury concerns after their opening win against Serbia, though there may be a change at left-back if Luke Shaw has recovered in time to be fit to start.\n\nIt would make sense for Southgate to go with roughly the same starting line-up, as he appears to have consolidated his favoured eleven. Although there are still question marks about who plays next to Declan Rice in midfield, expect Trent Alexander-Arnold to start once more, given his encouraging performance in the opener.\n\nFor Denmark, expect a similar line-up to the one that began the draw against Slovenia, with several players - including Andreas Christensen, Jannik Vestergaard, Christian Eriksen and Morten Hjulmand appearing undroppable. If they are struggling in attack, we may see Mikkel Damsgaard or Kasper Dolberg off the bench, but the starting XI appears fairly rigid.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nDenmark: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Wind, Hojlund.\n\nEngland: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Rice, Alexander-Arnold; Foden, Bellingham, Saka; Kane.\n\nEngland have the perfect chance to ensure qualification for the round of 16 and the opportunity to rest players in their final group game, so expect a determined performance to try and answer the questions posed after their nervy opening win. The Three Lions should have enough quality in midfield and attack to beat Denmark, though the impressive defensive duo of Stones and Geuhi will need to be way of the threat of players such as Eriksen, Hojlund and Hjulmand.

Harry Kane opened the scoring with a calm close-range finish, but their negative approach allowed Denmark back into the game and Morten Hjulmand's rocket from distance levelled the score.\n\nThe second half wasn't any more fruitful for the Three Lions, despite Gareth Southgate making a flurry of changes as the game drew to a close. In the end, they were slightly fortunate to come away with a point following a subpar display.\n\nHere is how X users reacted to the events that unfolded in Frankfurt.\n\nSimilarly to England's opener with Serbia, Southgate's side didn't make a particularly fast start against Denmark. However, yet again, they found themselves ahead before the 20-minute mark as Kane opened his Euro 2024 account.\n\nKyle Walker darted down the right flank and took advantage of some slack defending from Victor Kristiansen, firing a cross towards the penalty spot. After a few deflections, the ball fell to England's skipper, who slotted his side in front.\n\nHowever, England's joy was short-lived. Having dropped into a familiarly deep shape, Southgate's side invited enormous pressure on Jordan Pickford's goal and Denmark took full advantage.\n\nIt was a special strike that levelled proceedings, with midfielder Hjulmand arrowing a venomous strike in off the inside of the post from 25 yards out. England could have no complaints.\n\nHaving named an unchanged side from the 1-0 win over Serbia, Trent Alexander-Arnold once again came under scrutiny for his performance in midfield. He was not the only England starter off the pace, but Southgate's decision to substitute him in the 55th minute spoke volumes.\n\nA minute on from Alexander-Arnold's withdrawal, England created their best moment since Kane's opener. Phil Foden, who also received his share of criticism, leathered a low drive against the base of the post after drifting into his favoured number ten position.\n\nEven captain Kane wasn't immune to criticism and he was also hooked by Southgate with 20 minutes to play. Despite scoring, the Bayern Munich man hadn't done an awful lot and was rightly replaced by Ollie Watkins.\n\nThe Aston Villa striker made an immediate impact, racing in behind Denmark's defence and testing Kasper Schmeichel with a strong effort.\n\nSeveral of England's substitutes made a positive impact after replacing their more experienced teammates, but it still wasn't enough to earn the Three Lions victory.\n\nIn the end, a draw will have to do, with England not in any danger of missing out on the last 16. However, performances must improve heading into the latter stages of the competition.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j0vc2pecwycgy96ene.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Denmark will be looking to secure their first win of Euro 2024 after a draw against Slovenia.\n\nJude Bellingham's impressive performance in the first half was a major highlight in the tournament opener, shining brightly amid Gareth Southgate's ongoing challenge to integrate all his talented players effectively. However, England faltered after that and their performance was criticized despite the win against the not-so-strong Serbians.\n\nVital Match for Both Teams\n\nDenmark has a chance to seek revenge against England, who narrowly defeated them 2-1 in the semifinals of the 2020 European Championship. In their opening match on Saturday, the Danes drew 1-1 with Slovenia, marking an emotional return to the Euros for midfielder Christian Eriksen.\n\nEriksen scored Denmark's only goal three years after suffering a cardiac arrest during the last tournament.\n\nDespite Eriksen's standout performance, the Danish team failed to maintain their momentum and conceded an equalizer, resulting in a disappointing outcome.\n\nDenmark has experienced international success, having won the 1992 European Championship -- a feat that England has not achieved in their ten previous appearances. The Three Lions' loss to Italy in the 2020 final was their best result in recent tournaments.\n\nFollowing an exceptional season at Real Madrid, the 20-year-old Bellingham demonstrated on Sunday that he is prepared to bear the weight of England's high expectations. He joined Michael Owen as the only English players to score in both a European Championship and a World Cup before turning 21.\n\nGoalkeeper Jordan Pickford made a crucial late leaping save to secure the win, extending England's streak of five consecutive Euro group stage matches without conceding a goal, a record that dates back to their 2016 match against Wales.\n\nWhen and Where\n\nThe England vs Denmark Euro 2024 match will be played at Frankfurt, Germany, on Thursday, Jun 20 at 5pm BST/ 12pm ET/ 9.30pm IST.\n\nHow to Live Stream\n\nUnited States: The England vs Denmark Euro 2024 match will be broadcast live on the FOX networks, including Fox Sports.

Nevertheless, the 1992 champions have a history of causing upsets in this competition, and they'll be hoping to do the same again in Frankfurt. Here's everything you need to know ahead of the Group C fixture:\n\nWhen is Denmark v England?\n\nThe match will kick off at 5pm BST on Thursday 20 June at the Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nDenmark vs England will be shown live on BBC One and iPlayer, with coverage starting at 4pm. You can find a full list of which channel is showing each match here.\n\nIf you're travelling abroad and want to watch major sporting events, you might need a VPN to unblock your streaming app. Our VPN round-up is here to help and includes deals on VPNs in the market. Viewers using a VPN need to make sure that they comply with any local regulations where they are, and also with the terms of their service provider.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nEngland have no fresh injury concerns after their opening win against Serbia, although Luke Shaw will play no part having trained away from the group after returning from injury. Kieran Trippier set to continue at left-back.\n\nSouthgate will go with roughly the same starting line-up, as he appears to have consolidated his favoured eleven. Although there are still question marks about who plays next to Declan Rice in midfield, expect Trent Alexander-Arnold to start once more, given his encouraging performance in the opener.\n\nFor Denmark, expect a similar line-up to the one that began the draw against Slovenia, with several players - including Andreas Christensen, Jannik Vestergaard, Christian Eriksen and Morten Hjulmand appearing undroppable. If they are struggling in attack, we may see Mikkel Damsgaard or Kasper Dolberg off the bench, but the starting XI appears fairly rigid.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nDenmark: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Wind, Hojlund.\n\nEngland: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Rice, Alexander-Arnold; Foden, Bellingham, Saka; Kane.\n\nEngland have the perfect chance to ensure qualification for the round of 16 and the opportunity to rest players in their final group game, so expect a determined performance to try and answer the questions posed after their nervy opening win. The Three Lions should have enough quality in midfield and attack to beat Denmark, though the impressive defensive duo of Stones and Geuhi will need to be way of the threat of players such as Eriksen, Hojlund and Hjulmand.

But he, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka, were all hooked, with 20 minutes to go as Gareth Southgate tried to give his side energy.\n\nAnd last as in Sunday's laboured victory over Serbia, England got progressively worse and lost control of the game and the chance to guarantee qualification. Serbia's draw with Slovenia earlier in the day meant an England victory would put them through, and while they are still top of Group B they go into next Tuesday's final game knowing they could end up in third place.\n\nIt was a huge disappointment for the thousands of England supporters who had flocked to Frankfurt, while their Danish counterparts celebrated loudly with their fans at the final whistle.\n\nIt looked like Southgate failed to learn a lesson when he decided to stick with Trent Alexander-Arnold in an unchanged line-up. The Liverpool right-back had been press-ganged unto a midfield role to add creativity, but it did not work against Serbia and looked like another failed experiment here in Frankfurt. Alexander-Arnold's biggest strength is his crossing and passing ability, but he is not suited to a more central role and gave the ball away three times in the early stages, while offering little in terms of creativity.\n\nBy contrast Christian Eriksen was showing England what they need, a clever, calm playmaker who can find pockets of space, spot openings and deliver the ball with pinpoint precision.\n\nJude Bellingham wears the number ten for England, but he is not a playmaker in the Eriksen mould, more an all action box to box midfielder more akin to Bryan Robson. Foden could play the number ten role better, but he continues to be pushed out on the left in an unbalanced looking side.\n\nAnd so England, having started brightly and taken the lead through Kane in the 18th minute, lost their way again, handed the initiative to their opponents, and cannot have been surprised to concede an equaliser before half-time. By the end of the half they looked ragged and short of ideas, with only Foden finally taking it upon himself to get more involved, dropping deeper and demanding the ball, and running at defenders.\n\nOne such run from the halfway linec could have ended with a goal if Foden had played in Kane, who was in a good position, but the Manchester City man went for a goal himself and his shot lacked the power to trouble Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nThe Danish keeper was well beaten when Kane had put England ahead in the 18th minute, however, after a dreadful mistake from Viktor Kristianson. The Dane dawdled on the ball wide on the left, not seeing the danger as Kyle Walker appeared from nowhere to take the ball off his toes. Walker cut to the byline, and though his cutback was imprecise, the ball squirmed through to Kane, who steered it past Schmeichel with a low shot from close range.\n\nIt was a goal out of nothing, but the result of a defensive mistake rather than clever attacking play, and so was Denmark's equaliser. With England's defence being pinned back and unable to play through the Danish press, Kane dropped deep in a bid to help out, but his attempted clearance ran into no-man's land, and when the ball was relayed to Hjulmand, he hit a rasping shot from 35 yards that flew through a cluster of players, hit the inside of the far post, and nestled in the net.\n\nIt was no more than Denmark deserved and they took control for the remainder of the half, with England looking increasingly desperate.\n\nSouthgate waited until ten minutes into the second to make the expected change, replacing Alexander-Arnold with the more combative Conor Gallagher. England immediately looked better, and Foden rattled a shot against the base of the post, with Saka scooping the rebound over the bar.\n\nSaka had another chance when he was put in by Kane's clever crossfield pass, but the Arsenal man shot wide of the far post.\n\nIt was to be the pair's final involvement, as Southgate then removed them and Foden in a brutal cull with 20 minutes. Jude Bellingham survived, but he looked a shadow of the player who had been so dynamic in England's opening game.\n\nOllie Watkins, Kane's replacement, immediately looked more dangerous and went close twice. But England continued to create clear openings, while making defensive mistakes to give Denmark hope. Declan Rice gave the ball away twice in dangerous positions and Marc Guehi made a good recovery tackle after his howler let in Danish substitute Alexander Bah.\n\nLong before the final whistle it was clear England were going to have to settle for a point, and now face a nervy game against unbeaten Slovenia in Cologne next Tuesday.\n\nDENMARK (3-4-1-2): Schmeichel 7; Andersen 7, Christensen 7,

Nevertheless, the 1992 champions have a history of causing upsets in this competition, and they'll be hoping to do the same again in Frankfurt.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group C fixture:\n\nDenmark v England TV channel, start time and how to watch Euro 2024 fixture tonight\n\nWednesday 19 June 2024 22:00 , Lawrence Ostlere\n\nWelcome along to The Independent's live coverage of England's second group game of this Euro 2024, as they take on Denmark in Frankfurt today.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion_(Frankfurt)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waldstadion (Frankfurt)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1989b91c62896017ef7f3097c8d65ae5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1015, "textEnd": 1022}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Three Lions entered the competition as one of the favorites to lift the trophy next month. They could have booked an early place in the knockout rounds with a victory on the day. Nevertheless, Gareth Southgate's team may now have to find a positive result in their last group fixture to advance on.\n\nEngland entered the matchup seemingly in control of their group. The Three Lions were the only team of the quartet to win a match at Euros going into their fixture with Denmark. Slovenia drew both of their first two games of the competition and found themselves a point behind England before kickoff.\n\nThe Three Lions took a lead in the 18th minute of the match after enjoying a fair share of the possession in the early stages. Star striker Harry Kane found the back of the net after solid work on the flank by Kyle Walker. The defender raced down the right side of the pitch and sent a dangerous low cross into the middle of the box. The ball ricocheted off of several players, including Bukayo Saka, and found its way to the striker.\n\nKane then hit a shot into the bottom corner of the net just a few yards away from goal. It was the Bayern Munich forward's first goal of the tournament, but 64th total strike for his country. The goal, however, seemed to galvanize Denmark. England, despite holding the lead, appeared out of sorts for the remaining portion of the half.\n\nAs Denmark continued to look dangerous, the underdogs finally found the back of the net in the 34th minute. While Kane netted a score for his team, he then also helped create a goal for the Danes. The striker initially played a stray pass straight to his opponents. The ball fell right to Victor Kristiansen, who then picked out an open Morten Hjulmand inside England's half.\n\nAlthough the midfielder looked more likely to pass to another teammate, he instead took a shot from distance. The decision paid off as the shot arrowed off of the post and into the goal to level the scoreline. English goalkeeper Jordan Pickford seemingly had plenty of time to react to the shot. However, his view was obstructed by several players inside the box. The impressive strike will go down as one of the top goals of the entire Euro 2024 group stage.\n\nThe halftime break appeared the settle the Three Lions a little bit. Arsenal duo Declan Rice and Saka both took chances at goal early in the second half. Manchester City star Phil Foden then struck the post in the 56th minute with a dangerous shot from distance.\n\nDenmark, however, also had a few solid chances in the first portion of the second half as well. Perhaps their best scoring opportunity during this timeframe came from substitute Mikkel Damsgaard. The playmaker sent a shot on the half-volley towards Pickford in the 68th minute. The keeper was able to get his hands on the ball to make the stop though.\n\nWhile Denmark looked more likely to score a late winner, the match ended all square. England's failure to win the game will not go down well inside the nation. The tournament co-favorites alongside France have looked disjointed for much of their first two matches. Manager Gareth Southgate could also receive heat for replacing his entire front three with 20 minutes left in Thursday's match.\n\nEngland is next set to face Slovenia in their final Group C matchup. Denmark, on the other hand, will round out their group stage by playing Serbia. The two matches are scheduled to be played at the same time on Tuesday, June 25.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikkel_Damsgaard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikkel Damsgaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240620_WST_512646_England-Denmark.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 3571, "textEnd": 3578}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Gareth Southgate's side, dropping deep and lacking intensity, were wayward with their passing. Jude Bellingham - the star on Sunday - was anonymous, Trent Alexander-Arnold out of sorts in midfield.\n\nThere were scrappy, dangerous moments in the England box as Denmark sought an equaliser but there was nothing scruffy about Morten Hjulmand's stunning leveller, which he hammered in off a post after Kane gave the ball away deep in his own half.\n\nBukayo Saka tried to rally his side after the break, looping a header over Kasper Schmeichel and into the side-netting and he was unable to turn in the rebound when Phil Foden drove against an upright after the disappointing Alexander-Arnold had been hooked. Southgate's midfield experiment with the Liverpool man will surely be paused now.\n\nThe England head coach is rarely bold but this performance demanded an intervention and it came with a triple change on 69 minutes. Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze on. Captain Kane, Saka and Foden off. And there was almost an instant impact with Watkins nipping in behind the Danish defence before his shot was saved from a tight angle.\n\nBut with the otherwise impressive Marc Guehi having to frantically recover after giving the ball away and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg whistling a shot wide, England couldn't shake off their lethargy. Progress remains in their own hands going into the final group game with Slovenia on Tuesday - but they won't be going far in Germany with this kind of display.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/06/1600x900/skysports-john-stones-england_6586760.jpg?20240620185148", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Instead, they were fortunate to earn a point from a disorganised display.\n\nHarry Kane scored in his fourth successive major tournament to give England an 18th-minute lead.\n\nHowever, as has often been the case under Southgate's management, this goal marked the beginning of a retreat, allowing Denmark to dominate the remainder of the match.\n\nSloppy passes gave Denmark the opportunity to get back into the game from a long range stunner from Morton Hjulmand.\n\nSouthgate's side lacked intensity and frequently dropped deep, resulting in errant passing. Jude Bellingham, Sunday's standout performer, was largely invisible, while Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled to find his rhythm in midfield.\n\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg took the first shot on target within 30 seconds, but his low effort was easily collected by Jordan Pickford.\n\nEngland responded with some positive early touches, particularly through Bukayo Saka, who earned a throw-in while hugging the touchline.\n\nThe first ten minutes saw both teams testing each other, with Phil Foden creating England's first opportunity two minutes in.\n\nAfter manoeuvring around the edge of the box, Foden's shot sailed over the bar.\n\nEngland broke the deadlock in the 18th minute when Kane capitalised on Victor Kristiansen's error.\n\nThe Danish left-back hesitated, seemingly unaware he was under pressure, and was caught out by Kyle Walker's pressure.\n\nWalker produced a deflected pass that Kane converted from close range.\n\nDenmark equalised in the 34th minute with a long-range strike from Hjulmand.\n\nAn errant pass from England landed at Hjulmand's feet, and his shot from about 25 yards out beat Pickford, who reacted too late.\n\nJust before half-time, Joachim Andersen's off-balance header landed on the roof of the net, then Hojbjerg's attempt from outside the box was comfortably saved by Pickford, keeping the score level at the break.\n\nThe second half commenced with England struggling to maintain possession and showing no signs of improvement.\n\nTheir play was disjointed, marked by lethargic, sideways passing that led nowhere. There was a lack of movement and runners, and England's first chance of the half came from Saka, whose header dropped onto the side netting.\n\nAlexander-Arnold was substituted for Conor Gallagher in England's first change of the match.\n\nFoden came close again in the 56th minute, finding space to unleash a powerful shot that hit the post, nearly catching Kasper Schmeichel off guard.\n\nDenmark made their first substitution, bringing on Yussuf Poulsen for Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund. England responded with a triple substitution in the 68th minute: Ollie Watkins replaced Kane, Eberechi Eze came on for Saka, and Jarrod Bowen took Foden's place.\n\nKane, who had been dropping too deep and condensing play, was replaced by Watkins.\n\nThe Aston Villa man had an early opportunity, breaking through Denmark's defence, but Schmeichel anticipated the danger and made the save.\n\nMarc Guehi's mistake allowed Alexander Bah to break free with options in the box. However, Guehi quickly recovered and managed to rectify his error before Bah could capitalise.\n\nFive minutes before full-time, Bellingham lost possession, leading to another attempt by Hojbjerg, which went wide.\n\nThe match ended in a 1-1 draw, leaving England with four points from two games and plenty of room for improvement as they head to Cologne to face Slovenia.", "source": {"uri":

see them qualify for the knockout stages, but they turned in a poor display despite taking the lead through Harry Kane.\n\nSouthgate's men sat back and allowed Denmark back into the game, and they equalised through a brilliant strike from Morten Hjulmand, but neither side were able to find a winner.\n\nFollowing an indifferent display against Serbia in the opening game many people were expecting an improvement against Denmark, but that simply didn't happen.\n\nThe Three Lions took the lead after good work from Kyle Walker down the right hand side, and his cut back deflected into Kane's path and he duly applied the finish.\n\nAfter taking the lead, England like they so often do under Southgate just sat off instead of going for the kill and were punished when no one closed down Hjulmand who fired a superb strike into the corner from outside the box.\n\nEngland looked lethargic with the team lacking balance particularly in midfield, and Trent Alexander-Arnold was once again subbed off, whilst Kane was also ineffective.\n\nThe performance will no doubt lead to questions given the talent at Southgate's disposal and Shearer feels serious questions will be coming his way.\n\n\"Gareth Southgate will get serious questions,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"You see the players out there, Phil Foden and what he has done all season for Manchester City, Jude Bellingham turning up in the first game and not so much tonight, John Stones and what we have seen him do at club level.\n\n\"There is far more to get out of those players than he is getting at the moment.\n\n\"Gareth at the minute is not getting the best out of England's best players.\"\n\nThe draw against Denmark means England have still never won their opening two games at a European Championships, and they will have to wait until the final group game against Slovenia on Tuesday to qualify for the knockout stages.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"},

That's showing, there's levels we can reach and we can be better with and without it.\n\n\"But the sign of a good team is to find results when you're not playing your best.\n\n\"We know we can improve.

Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo appeared as substitutes at the weekend and are the most likely alternatives to the Liverpool star.\n\nEngland projected starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Pickford (GK) -- Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier -- Alexander-Arnold, Rice -- Foden, Bellingham, Saka -- Kane.\n\nKasper Hjulmand could similarly field an unchanged side, although Joakim Maehle could provide an attacking outlet at wing-back.\n\nManchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has seven goals in 15 international caps and will lead the line for his country once more.\n\nDenmark projected starting lineup (3-4-1-2): Schmeichel (GK) -- Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard -- Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen -- Eriksen -- Wind, Hojlund.\n\nYou have to go back to a 2014 friendly for the last time England beat Denmark in 90 minutes. The suffocating tension of that Euro 2020 semifinal came after a pair of Nations League meetings earlier in the 2020/21 season when the Scandinavians won 1-0 at Wembley and shared a 0-0 draw in Copenhagen.\n\nBoth teams taking a grip on their opening games before letting it slip suggests each will have their moments in the ascendency during this match. Despite England's superior quality on paper, two teams who know each other well while grasping for their best form might prove hard to separate once more.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com",

Instead of driving home their advantage, England, just like against Serbia, began to sit deep and lose control, allowing the Danes' confidence to build.\n\nIn the 34th minute, Kane went from hero to zero, sloppily giving the ball away following a throw-in, with Hjulmand taking advantage and firing a thunderbolt from distance into the bottom left corner.\n\nIt was a wake-up call for England, yet not one that the players seemed to hear, with mis-placed passes, failed attempts to dribble out of trouble and a general lack of cohesion all over the pitch.\n\nDenmark had a few close chances in the meantime, with Joachim Andersen heading over from a corner while Jordan Pickford did well to deal with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's powerful effort.\n\nFoden, maligned from the first match, was determined to make himself the hero, but could only aim a tame effort at Kasper Schmeichel after a great run, before firing over again with the last kick of the first-half.\n\nThings improved somewhat after the break, with Foden smacking the post and Bukayo Saka hitting the side netting, but frustration among fans in the stadium and at home was mounting.\n\nFor all England's faults, Denmark must be praised for their efforts and they continued to push for a second, with Christian\n\nWith Plan A well and truly in the mud, Southgate turned to his bench, and in a radical change brought Kane, Saka and Foden off for Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze.\n\nThis certainly livened things up with Watkins getting behind the defence and drawing a fine stop from Schmeichel. Denmark retaliated, Hojbjerg again forcing Pickford into action.\n\nMarc Guehi looked to have gifted Alexander Bah a golden opportunity but the centre-back raced back to stop the attack and moments later Hojbjerg came close to a late winner but couldn't curl his effort into the top corner.\n\nMORE : Didier Deschamps gives huge Kylian Mbappe update for France vs Netherlands", "source": {"uri":

The signs were there again in the narrow win over Serbia on Sunday and against the Danes, it was at its infuriating worst.\n\nThe trend of meekly surrendering control after scoring the opening goal continued in rotten fashion on Thursday and while Morten Hjulmand's majestic strike was something special, it had been coming from the moments the Danes kicked off again after Kane's opener.\n\nEngland were so deep at one point in the first half, Kane's only option was to try and bulldoze his way up field 70 yards out from goal, quickly swarmed and snuffed out. No runners and no movement undermined anything and everything England tried to muster.\n\nEven sitting deep, England's carelessness with the ball was staggering. Declan Rice, Kyle Walker and John Stones, so used to crisply finding their teammates with ease, were the worst offenders in the first-half. It was Kane's wayward pass in-field that found its way to Hjulmand to score from range.\n\nThe searing heat in Frankfurt and the turf that began tearing up from the opening minutes will not have helped by the inability to keep the ball under no pressure was a huge concern.\n\nAlexander-Arnold was also among those guilty of being too careless on the ball with England's midfield lacking any zip or penetration. The Liverpool right-back was given eight minutes of the second-half to turn things around but by minute 54, his evening was over with Conor Gallagher given his chance.\n\nAlexander-Arnold didn't necessarily have a bad game against Serbia but was among the most passive of those in England shirts. The school of thought among many pundits leading into the competition was that Alexander-Arnold in midfield should be successful enough to navigate the group stages. But it appears to have failed at its first meaningful test.\n\nKane registered just three touches of the ball in the first-half against Serbia. He had beaten that tally within the opening 10 minutes against Denmark, on the score sheet after 18 but his static performance leading the line was a problem.\n\nFormer England internationals Rio Ferdinand and Alan Shearer were left exasperated with his performance and the sight of him being replaced with 20 minutes of the game left was welcomed.\n\nKane persistently dropping deep left England starved of an out ball, exacerbating problems in midfield rather than solving them. Denmark found it far too easy to mark him out of the game, aside from the goal, and Watkins' introduction immediately injected some life into proceedings, picked out by Bellingham only to be denied by Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nIt leaves Southgate with a huge dilemma on his hands for the rest of the competition.\n\nMORE : Dismal England draw with Denmark as lacklustre Euro 2024 continues\n\nMORE :

Hjulmand struck in the 34th minute to cancel out the goal scored by Harry Kane in the 18th minute as Denmark and England played out a tight 1-1 draw in an even contest in Group C. Both goals came in the first half and the two sides made some good attempts in the second session but could not find the back of the net.\n\nWith this draw, England moved to four points from two matches while Denmark and Slovenia have two points each from two draws. Serbia have one point from two games.\n\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg's shot on target within the very first minute seemed to promise an end-to-end contest, but what soon transpired was an England team controlling possession and scant opportunities for either side.\n\nThe Three Lions eventually upped the tempo, however, and after a good chance for Phil Foden, Harry Kane buried a diverted cross from close range.\n\nAfter that, Denmark began cranking up the pressure - and they reaped the benefits. Morten Hjulmand chose the perfect moment to score his first international goal, equalising with an exquisite long-range strike into the bottom corner.\n\nDenmark also created the second half's first chance, with Jonas Wind's shot being blocked. The Danes enjoyed spells of fluid possession after the restart, dictating the pace of the game, but it was England who went closest to adding to the scoreline, with a Foden shot coming back off a post.\n\nBoth coaches made changes in an attempt to eke out victory, and substitute Ollie Watkins - on for Kane - had a chance to find the net swiftly after coming on, only for Kasper Schmeichel to deny him.

The 30-year-old Kane scored 36 goals in just 32 Bundesliga games last season, clinching his first European Golden Shoe award. He also has scored six goals in his last eight matches since the end of April.\n\nIn addition, the Three Lions have been nearly unbeatable for 18 months. Since the end of the 2022 World Cup, England have seven wins, two draws and two losses across 11 matches. They have outscored their opponents over that time 24-8. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back Denmark\n\nThe Danes have a world-class playmaker in the middle in Christian Eriksen. He suffered cardiac arrest during a match against Finland in the 2021 European Championships before being resuscitated by a defibrillator. Now, the 32-year-old midfielder leads Denmark in goals with 42. In Sunday's 1-1 draw against Slovenia, Eriksen scored a beautiful goal, using his chest to redirect the ball before volleying it past keeper Jan Oblak.\n\nEriksen and the rest of the Danish attack will face a potentially vulnerable England backline. England's new centerback pairing of John Stones and Marc Guehi has limited experience playing together after Harry Maguire was left off the roster.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nEngland take on Denmark in their second game of Euro 2024 looking to improve on a nervy win over Serbia in their opening fixture.\n\nJude Bellingham's first-half goal was enough to clinch three points, but Gareth Southgate's side rarely looked in control in the second half and rode their luck at times.\n\nDenmark shared a draw with Slovenia in their opening match, after Christian Eriksen's early goal delighted fans in his first European Championship appearance since collapsing on the pitch three years ago.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group C fixture.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nEngland have no fresh injury concerns after their opening win against Serbia, although Luke Shaw trained away from the group as the left back continues an individualised programme after returning from injury. He is unlikely to feature, with Kieran Trippier set to continue at left-back.\n\nIt would make sense for Southgate to go with roughly the same starting line-up, as he appears to have consolidated his favoured eleven. Although there are still question marks about who plays next to Declan Rice in midfield, expect Trent Alexander-Arnold to start once more, given his encouraging performance in the opener.\n\nFor Denmark, expect a similar line-up to the one that began the draw against Slovenia, with several players - including Andreas Christensen, Jannik Vestergaard, Christian Eriksen and Morten Hjulmand appearing undroppable. If they are struggling in attack, we may see Mikkel Damsgaard or Kasper Dolberg off the bench, but the starting XI appears fairly rigid.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nDenmark: Schmeichel; Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard; Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen; Eriksen; Wind, Hojlund.\n\nEngland: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Rice, Alexander-Arnold; Foden, Bellingham, Saka; Kane.\n\nWhen is Denmark v England?\n\nThe match will kick off at 5pm BST on Thursday 20 June at the Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nDenmark vs England will be shown live on BBC One and iPlayer, with coverage starting at 4pm. You can find a full list of which channel is showing each match here.\n\nIf you're travelling abroad and want to watch major sporting events, you might need a VPN to unblock your streaming app. Our VPN round-up is here to help and includes deals on VPNs in the market. Viewers using a VPN need to make sure that they comply with any local regulations where they are, and also with the terms of their service provider.\n\nEngland have the perfect chance to ensure qualification for the round of 16 and the opportunity to rest players in their final group game, so expect a determined performance to try and answer the questions posed after their nervy opening win. The Three Lions should have enough quality in midfield and attack to beat Denmark, though the impressive defensive duo of Stones and Geuhi will need to be way of the threat of players such as Eriksen, Hojlund and Hjulmand.

Victor Kristiansen had no idea Kyle Walker was eating up the ground behind him and the Manchester City right-back got onto Bellingham's pass before sending a low cross into the box.\n\nTwo ricochets off Denmark defenders saw a chance fall kindly to Kane and the captain made no mistake on the six-yard line, guiding his effort into the far corner with Schmeichel given no chance.\n\nHowever, England's common tendency to drop reared its ugly head again. Loose passes gave Denmark possession time and time again and the Three Lions were punished when Hjulmand was given space to thrash a shot towards goal from 30 yards, hitting the inside of the post and bouncing over the line to equalise.\n\nKasper Hjulmand's side continued to press well at the start of the second half, disturbing an increasingly beleaguered England midfield that offered little obvious plan in and out of possession. Alexander-Arnold was dragged off before the hour mark before Foden smacked the post with a low effort from distance.\n\nFoden, Kane and Saka were brought off in a triple change but it didn't have the desired effect, with Denmark still looking the more likely to claim all three points.\n\nNo late winner arrived, however, with Southgate left with a lot to think about before his side's final group stage outing.\n\nGK: Kasper Schmeichel - 6/10 - Made a couple of smart saves and commanded his area well.\n\nCB: Joachim Andersen - 6/10 - Was comfortable enough defending deep and nodding crosses away.\n\nCB: Jannik Vestergaard - 5/10 - Looked slow and ponderous when England moved the ball quickly, which thankfully for him wasn't too often.\n\nCB: Andreas Christensen - 6/10 - Another of the Danish centre-backs who had a comfortable time dealing with England's passive attack.\n\nRWB: Joakim Maehle - 6/10 - Offered a willing runner up and down the right and picked up a caution.\n\nCM: Morten Hjulmand - 8/10 - Produced a fantastic hit from distance that brought the Danes back onto level terms. He and Hojbjerg were always a step ahead of England's midfield.\n\nCM: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - 7/10 - Got shot after shot away and nearly came close to bagging the winner late on. Won the ball back often.\n\nLWB: Victor Kristiansen - 5/10 - Awfully asleep to Walker's surging run as the Danes fell behind. Short pass assisted Hjulmand's cracker.\n\nAM: Christian Eriksen - 6/10 - Helped Denmark create the better openings and led their defensive effort well from the front.\n\nST: Rasmus Hojlund - 5/10 - Was crowded out by England's centre-backs whenever the ball arrived at his feet.\n\nST: Jonas Wind - 5/10 - Unsettled England's defenders but didn't have too much in the way of attacking to do.\n\nSubs not used: Frederik Ronnow (GK), Mads Hermansen (GK), Mathias Jorgensen, Rasmus Kristensen, Simon Kjaer, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Mathias Jensen, Anders Dreyer, Kasper Dolberg.\n\nKasper Hjulmand - 6/10 - His side made a poor start but were helped by England's passiveness allowed them a route back into the game.\n\nGK: Jordan Pickford - 7/10 - The busier of the two goalkeepers, though Pickford often had simple long-range strikes to gather.\n\nRB: Kyle Walker - 6/10 - Brushed off an early injury scare to play a key part in the opening goal.\n\nCB: John Stones - 6/10 - Needed to use his experience to push England forward. Defended reasonably well.\n\nCB: Marc Guehi - 7/10 - Sniffed out danger well and stepped in to deny Hojlund any time on the ball.\n\nLB: Kieran Trippier - 5/10 - Did his job well enough defensively but looks so awkward in attack.\n\nCM: Trent Alexander-Arnold - 5/10 - Pinged a few long passes forward and got on the charge infrequently but was off before the hour mark having left a few too many holes in midfield.\n\nCM: Declan Rice - 4/10 - England needed his bursting runs from midfield to drag them out of their malaise but they didn't arrive.\n\nRW: Bukayo Saka - 5/10 - Started to run at his marker more often as the game progressed and got more joy, but was hooked alongside Kane and Foden.\n\nAM: Jude Bellingham - 5/10 - Much quieter in the opening 45 than he was against Serbia. Things didn't get much better in the second half.\n\nLW: Phil Foden - 6/10 - Skipped away from some challenges but made the wrong decisions in the opening 45 minutes. Hit the post with a nice effort from distance.\n\nST: Harry Kane - 6/10 - Showed typical composure to fire England into an early lead but his wayward pass helped Hjulmand equalise.\n\nSUB: Conor Gallagher (54' for Alexander-Arnold) - 5/10 - Booked for a late challenge shortly after his introduction.\n\nSubs not used: Aaron Ramsdale (GK), Dean Henderson (GK), Ezri Konsa, Joe Gomez, Lewis Dunk, Adam Wharton, Kobbie Mainoo, Anthony Gordon, Cole Palmer, Ivan Toney\n\nGareth Southgate - 3/10 - A few experiments that Southgate has tested out need to be brought to an end quickly. The England boss has had tournament success before and needs to get back to the formula that has worked for them before.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"},

To that point, no other England player had achieved the feat.\n\nKane has now equalled that, however.

Went about his work with minimum fuss and was a commanding presence between the sticks.\n\nDEFENCE\n\nJoachim Andersen - 7/10\n\nDealt with Kane for long periods and can be pleased with what was a strong performance. Entered Euro 2024 off the back of an impressive campaign for Crystal Palace.\n\nAndreas Christensen - 7/10\n\nPlayed a lot of football in the Barcelona midfield in the second half of last season, but he has been back in defence at Euro 2024 and put in another strong performance here.\n\nJannik Vestergaard - 6/10\n\nFound it difficult at times when England were able to isolate him, but the centre-back was strong in the air, and he also deserves credit for helping Denmark claim a welcome point.\n\nMIDFIELD\n\nJoakim Maehle - 6/10\n\nCame into the side in the wing-back role on the right, and he was able to help out his defence, but the 27-year-old did find it difficult to produce higher up the field.\n\nMorten Hjulmand - 8/10\n\nLevelled the scores with a stunning strike in the first half, and he was uncertainly one of Denmark's best players against England, with his reputation growing further due to another strong performance.\n\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg - 9/10\n\nComfortably the best player on the pitch. Had five shots in total, with two of those coming close to goals, while he made six tackles and finished with a pass success rate of 89%.\n\nChristian Eriksen - 7/10\n\nVeteran is likely to leave Manchester United this summer in search of regular action, and he showed his class with a solid performance for Denmark, with his passing a particular highlight.\n\nVictor Kristiansen - 5/10\n\nMade a terrible mistake for England's opener, with Kyle Walker catching the wing-back out, but he did improve before being replaced in the 57th minute of the contest.\n\nATTACK\n\nRasmus Hojlund - 6/10\n\nStretched England with his pace and movement early on, and he was a threat in the first period, but the Manchester United striker struggled after the break and was replaced in the 67th minute.\n\nJonas Wind - 5/10\n\nDropped into a deeper position at times, with Hojlund through the middle, but the attacker struggled to get involved in his side's passing moves, and he was replaced in the 57th minute alongside Kristiansen.\n\nSUBSTITUTES\n\nMikkel Damsgaard - 6/10\n\nWas Denmark's first player off the bench in the 57th minute, but the forward struggled to get into the match from an attacking point of view.\n\nAlexander Bah - 6/10\n\nHad a brilliant chance to deliver a dangerous cross into the England box late on, but he was denied by Marc Guehi. Brought energy to the wing-back position after dropping out of the XI.\n\nYussuf Poulsen - 6/10\n\nReplaced Hojlund in the 67th minute of the contest, but he was unable to make much of an impact, with England's defence largely being tested by the Denmark midfielders.\n\nAndreas Skov Olsen - 6/10\n\nWas a part of a double Denmark change in the 82nd minute, and Olsen brought energy to his side in the latter stages of the contest.\n\nChristian Norgaard - 6/10\n\nAs expected, Norgaard proved to be a dependable performer for Denmark when he was introduced in the 82nd minute, with the midfielder a calming presence.\n\nEngland player ratings vs. Denmark: Bellingham, Kane struggle for Three Lions\n\nGOALKEEPER\n\nJordan Pickford - 7/10\n\nHad no chance with Denmark's leveller, and the Everton goalkeeper made some smart saves during the contest. Can be pleased with his performance in England's second match at the European Championship.\n\nDEFENCE\n\nKyle Walker - 6/10\n\nHis bright run and cross led to England making the breakthrough, but the Manchester City defender faded from an attacking point of view as the match progressed.\n\nJohn Stones - 6/10\n\nOne of England's most gifted players in possession of the ball, but the centre-back has been unable to showcase his skills during Euro 2024.\n\nMarc Guehi - 6/10\n\nNot quite as impressive as his first performance against Serbia, but he was again solid in the middle of the defence and recovered well to block after a mistake in the second period.\n\nKieran Trippier - 6/10\n\nSolid defensively for England, but Trippier was hardly seen as an attacking threat. In an ideal world, head coach Southgate would be able to call upon Luke Shaw down the left.\n\nMIDFIELD\n\nDeclan Rice - 6/10\n\nShowed at Arsenal last season that he is capable of dominating matches from midfield, but Rice was asked to sit deep here, and he struggled to have an impact.\n\nJude Bellingham - 6/10\n\nProved to be England's star player against Serbia, but the Real Madrid midfielder found it difficult against Denmark, with the team's shape making it difficult for him to have an impact.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - 5/10\n\nMidfield experiment just did not work again; there is no doubting the Liverpool man's quality, but the 25-year-old is a defender, and he should be replaced in the starting XI for the next match.\n\nATTACK\n\nBukayo Saka - 6/10\n\nWas one of England's best players against Serbia, but the Arsenal attacker found it difficult against Denmark. Had a half-chance early in the second period, heading into the side-netting from close range.\n\nHarry Kane - 6/10\n\nFound the back of the net with a smart finish in the first period, but the Three Lions captain was dropping far too deep, and it was not a shock when he was replaced in the 69th minute.\n\nPhil Foden - 6/10\n\nHit the post early in the second period and had a couple of other half-chances during a decent display, but he has not managed to make his mark at the competition thus far.\n\nSUBSTITUTES\n\nConor Gallagher - 6/10\n\nPicked up a yellow card shortly after entering the field for a late challenge on Christensen. Was unable to influence the match after his entry early in the second period.\n\nJarrod Bowen - 6/10\n\nWas a part of a triple change for England in the 69th minute, and the West Ham United forward did bring energy to the attack, but he was unable to have a serious impact.\n\nOllie Watkins - 7/10\n\nHad a brilliant chance to win it for England, but he was denied by Schmeichel. Denmark's defenders did not relish coming up against the Aston Villa striker in the latter stages.\n\nEberechi Eze - 6/10\n\nEntered Euro 2024 off the back of an excellent season for Palace, but Eze was unable to stamp his authority on this match, with Denmark able to deal with him.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

It seems Southgate's side still have some work to do.\n\nHarry Kane gave England the lead in the opening 20 minutes of the match, in what was a dream start for the Three Lions. Kyle Walker's deflected cross ricocheted off several Danish defenders before it fell to the England captain, who took great delight in tapping in his first goal at Euro 2024.\n\nA lapse in concentration in defence would see England fail to shut down Sporting midfielder Morten Hjulmand, who fired a long-range effort past Jordan Pickford to pull a goal back for Kasper Hjulmand's side before half-time.\n\nIn the second half, England struggled for creativity and were unable to find a winner, with Denmark, eager to press, giving Southgate's side a few late scares. Mail Sport's CRAIG HOPE delivers his player ratings from Deutsche Bank Park.\n\nHad to make lots of saves given how often Denmark were afforded the ball, but most of them were routine.\n\nWill maybe wonder if he could have got down to keep out Denmark goal from 25 yards. He's not to blame for this dismal showing, however.\n\nKyle Walker 6\n\nCredit for his awareness in making the steal from a sleeping opponent before creating Kane's goal with a deflected cross, but he did not get forward nowhere near as much as he should and can. He had a shaky start and needed a change of boots, and he was OK defensively.\n\nJohn Stones 6\n\nWe did not see any of the ball-playing ability he showcases for Manchester City, but maybe that was because if he stepped into midfield he would have been met with his own midfielders on his toes! He was pinned in by own team at times and had to worry more about what was coming at him from those in red.\n\nMarc Guehi 6\n\nHe had done well but then almost ruined a steady display with a slip to allow Bah to run clear. He recovered to make the tackle, but as much because the Denmark forward was slow. He then lost his man from the resulting corner. Those moments apart, he can be satisfied enough.\n\nKieran Trippier 6.5\n\nEngland needed him with a couple of big interventions in the moments after Kane's goal. He played most of the game without anyone in front of him either, given how much Foden vacated his position on the left. A solid showing on and off the ball and just about England's best - even if that was the best of a bad bunch.\n\nDeclan Rice 4.5\n\nWill not be happy by the manner in which he lost the ball on several occasions. At one point he blamed Bellingham for not offering an option, but Rice needs to look closer to home. By his standards, this was a very poor performance, and it looked like he knew it.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold 4\n\nThis must be the end of the midfield experiment. You can't blame the player, he's not a midfielder! He was hooked after 54 minutes after a performance in which he gave the ball away far too often and went AWOL as Denmark took control. His head was clearly gone after half-time.\n\nBukayo Saka 5\n\nNowhere near the level of danger he posed against Serbia. He did not play badly, but nor did he do much good. With plenty of alternatives in wide areas, he has to do more than this. Like others, his energy in the press to disturb the Danes was not there.\n\nJude Bellingham 5\n\nFrom Roy of the Rovers to Doncaster Rovers, the man-of-the-match from Serbia was a shadow of the star from Sunday. He didn't win his duels and was all too rarely on the ball. When he did have it he kept onto it for too long and did not populate the box like he did in the opening game. He did well not to be substituted.\n\nPhil Foden 6\n\nOut of position on the left wing, again, every time he impacted it was when drifting inside, at times even right of centre in midfield. He had good moments, two good runs followed by poor finishes and another when he cracked post, but he cannot continue in a position he does not want to play. It's detrimental to the team.\n\nHarry Kane 4.5\n\nRight place to pounce for opener but then gifted possession to Danes for equaliser with baffling cross-field ball - he did not look where it was going. Dropped so deep but was unable to press opponents.

highlights, man of the match and the best statistics.\n\nyou have updates\n\nMorten Hjulmand cancelled out an opener from Harry Kane, as Denmark came from behind to draw 1-1 with England in Thursday's Euro 2024 fixture in Stuttgart.\n\nKane's first goal of the summer competition had sent England ahead in the 18th minute, but a stunner from Morten Hjulmand saw the points shared in the Group C contest.\n\nThe result has left Gareth Southgate's side top of the section, two points ahead of both second-placed Denmark and third-placed Slovenia.\n\nEngland have not yet qualified for the last-16 stage of the European Championship, but they are in a very strong position ahead of their final match against Slovenia on Tuesday night.\n\nHere, Sports Mole provides an in-depth analysis of the clash in Stuttgart, in addition to highlights, our man of the match and the best statistics.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n1st min: Half-chance for Denmark in the early exchanges, but Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg fires straight into the arms of England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford after smart work from Rasmus Hojlund.\n\n13th min: Phil Foden works his way into a shooting position inside the Denmark box, but he just lifts his effort over the crossbar.\n\n18th min: England make the breakthrough in the 18th minute, with Kane sliding the ball into the bottom corner from close range after a mistake from Victor Kristiansen, who had allowed Walker to break into the Denmark box, and the defender's cross eventually came for Kane.\n\n34th min: Denmark level the scores in the 34th minute of the contest, and it is a stunning hit from Morten Hjulmand, who finds the bottom corner with an effort off the inside of the post; Pickford dived towards the bottom corner but was unable to make contact.\n\n44th min: Pickford has to keep out a powerful strike from Hojbjerg, with Denmark threatening to score a second in the closing stages of the first period.\n\n45th min: Foden finds space outside the Denmark box late in the first period, but the attacker's effort was always rising over the crossbar.\n\nHALF TIME: DENMARK 1-1 ENGLAND\n\n51st min: Declan Rice tries his luck from outside the penalty box, but Kasper Schmeichel manages to make a comfortable save to keep the score level.\n\n53rd min: Bukayo Saka heads into the side-netting after beating Schmeichel to a bouncing ball, with England having their second sight of the Denmark goal.\n\n56th min: Foden hits one off the post for England after finding space outside the Denmark box; much better from the Manchester City attacker.\n\n72nd min: Schmeichel is on hand to make a brilliant save to deny Ollie Watkins from close range, with the Aston Villa striker making an immediate impact.\n\n73rd min: Pickford has to get down to keep out a strike from Hojbjerg, with both sides having their moments during a well-contested second period in Frankfurt.\n\n84th min: Alexander Bah sees his cross deflected behind by Marc Guehi after taking the ball away from the Englishman, before Andreas Christensen heads the resulting corner over the crossbar.\n\n85th min: Hojbjerg sees a brilliant strike drift just wide of the England goal.\n\nFULL TIME: DENMARK 1-1 ENGLAND\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH - PIERRE-EMILE HOJBJERG\n\nHojbjerg was the star of the show on Thursday evening, with the Tottenham midfielder putting in a brilliant performance in the middle of the Denmark midfield.\n\nThe 28-year-old had five shots in total, with at least two of those coming close to registering, while he made six tackles and ended with a pass completion rate of 89%, according to WhoScored.\n\nThere were certainly more glamorous players on the field, but Hojbjerg continued to go about his work impressively, and it was a standout performance from the midfielder.\n\nSTANDOUT MOMENT\n\nThis is not a difficult one.\n\nDenmark's equaliser was a stunning hit from Morten Hjulmand, with the midfielder taking a touch out of his feet before drilling a sensational effort into the bottom corner.\n\nEngland would not have been too concerned when he lined the ball up from that position, but the 24-year-old demonstrated why he is being tracked by a number of major clubs.\n\nSporting Lisbon will do well to keep hold of the central midfielder this summer.\n\nBEST STATS\n\nMATCH STATS\n\nPossession: Denmark 46%-54% England\n\nShots: Denmark 16-11

Harry Kane's spot-kick was saved but he turned home the rebound to send his country through to the final.\n\nDenmark have not forgotten about the decision. Head coach Kasper Hjulmand said: \"Maybe some of the players can take something from that.\"\n\nFan friction\n\nEngland supporters will be hoping for a much smoother ride when they make the journey to Frankfurt, having experienced issues in the previous game in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nTravel chaos before and after the Serbia game left some fans stranded in and around the stadium and unable to make onward journeys once they made it back into the city centre.\n\nWith the Deutsche Bank Park, home of Bundesliga outfit Eintracht Frankfurt, better connected fans will be optimistic of a better all-round experience.\n\n50 not out for Kieran Trippier\n\nEngland\u00b4s Kieran Trippier during the Euro 2024 Group C win over Serbia (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nKieran Trippier will mark a half-century of England caps if he starts as expected in Frankfurt.\n\nThe Newcastle defender has been operating at left-back with Luke Shaw still battling back to full fitness having not played for Manchester United since suffering a hamstring injury in February.\n\nTrippier is a more than able deputy and one of the men Southgate had relied upon at all four major tournaments at the helm - but he will need another strong showing if he is to keep his place once Shaw is ready for action.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Is England's head-to-head record against Denmark any good? And how do their squad values compare?\n\nRead on for a 60-second primer for this Group C match, which kicks off at 5pm UK time.\n\nHaving won their first game against Serbia on Sunday, England can guarantee their place in the last 16 by beating Denmark today.\n\nA draw or defeat would leave them needing a result in their last group game against Slovenia on Tuesday to be certain, but the reality is that Gareth Southgate's men are all but qualified already.\n\nSince four of the six teams which finish third in their groups will also progress to the next round, it will take a huge reversal of fortunes for England to go home early.\n\nDenmark's need for points is greater, having only managed a draw against Slovenia, who are on paper the weakest team in Group C.\n\nA win for the Danes would almost certainly send them through, even if it means relying on being one of the best third-placed teams.\n\nA draw or defeat would likely leave them needing to beat Serbia on Tuesday to go further.\n\nThe two teams have met 22 times in international football, with England winning 13 of those matches and losing just four.\n\nIn their 11 competitive meetings - Euros, World Cups, qualifiers and Nations League fixtures - England have won six and lost twice.\n\nSo England hold the upper hand, although they have only won two of their last seven competitive matches against Denmark.\n\nOne of those was in the semi-finals of the last Euros, when Southgate's team needed extra-time and a disputed penalty to advance.\n\nBoth of Denmark's competitive wins over England - in a 1983 Euro qualifier and in 2020 in the Nations League - have come via a 1-0 scoreline achieved by a penalty.\n\nEngland have the most valuable squad at Euro 2024, according to independent consultants Football Benchmark, worth an estimated \u20ac1.382bn (\u00a31.166bn).\n\nBut Denmark rank ninth of the 24 teams at the tournament with a valuation of \u20ac418.9m (\u00a3354.1m), which puts them ahead of the likes of Croatia, Turkey, Switzerland and Group C rivals Serbia.\n\nThe top 10, based on valuations of each squad's 18 most valuable players, is: England, France, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Croatia.", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_dalleres@cityam.com", "name": "Frank Dalleres",

Their style, tactics, form and injuries are combining to go from bad to worse...\n\n* England's record scorer is now their biggest problem. Harry Kane missed Bayern Munich's final three matches with a back injury and still doesn't look fit. Having barely touched the ball against Serbia, he was statuesque against Denmark. Are England now carrying their captain?\n\n* England's form is worrying. With just two wins from their last seven matches, they would be relegation candidates if this was a club league.\n\n* And their performances have been even worse. There is no recognisable style of play, no discernible patterns of play other than the tactic of passing the ball to Bukayo Saka and hoping he will deliver.\n\n* England are declining. They were poor against Serbia. They were worse against Denmark. As Kane said afterwards, \"We're struggling with and without the ball.\" In other words, they are really struggling full stop.\n\n* Judging by what happens next in their performance, it's actually bad news when England score. Should we stop celebrating goals?\n\n* Gareth Southgate just doesn't seem able to rouse his troops. England were crying out for a rallying call at half-time. Instead they re-emerged devoid of energy.\n\n* Nor does Southgate - at least currently - seem able to unlock, particularly in attack, the performances from his players that they consistently deliver at a club level.\n\n* England's starting XI against Denmark proved remarkably unbalanced. Even with the defence too deep, a chasm still existed between the Declan Rice/Trent Alexander-Arnold pivot and Jude Bellingham. Better teams than Denmark will exploit the gaping holes between them. Then, with the defence still so far back, the gap between England's rearguard and midfield was simply unworkable.\n\n* Harry Maguire has his faults, but are England missing his leadership? It's the only obvious explanation for why the defence sits so deep - and, worse, continues to sit so deep even when it's so plain that England are tactically tactics are not working. On the ball and in direction, John Stones just doesn't seem able to exert any authority in an England shirt.\n\n* Phil Foden clearly doesn't want to play on the left. So he drifts inside to where Bellingham is stationed. Cue a midfield muddle and a lopsided team shape. Is it time to make the call: Foden or Bellingham?\n\n* Having finished his season as a No 8, Declan Rice suddenly looks uncomfortable as a No 6.\n\n* England's Euro 2024 squad had plenty of gambles but none more so than the inclusion of the injured Luke Shaw as the only recognised left-back. With the Manchester United defender's inactivity stretching into months rather than weeks, his ongoing unavailability through the opening group matches makes it extremely unlikely we will see him - the only left-footed left-back in England's 26 - before the tournament ends. Playing a right-back at left-back isn't England's biggest problem, but it is a problem.\n\n* And then there's the tactical gamble. Trent Alexander-Arnold was England's first withdrawal against both Serbia and Denmark. Given that his exit against the Danes occurred just a few minutes into the second half, Southgate has surely accepted defeat in the midfield experiment that England have supposedly spent a year working on. So what now?\n\n* Bellingham looks shattered. Just as worryingly, it looks as if England don't know where to play him. Is he really a No 10? Should England try him as an 8? But does Bellingham actually need a break more than he needs a change of position?\n\n* It doesn't help that the rest of the tournament has been so good. It only highlights how laboured and lethargic England's displays have been.\n\n* England don't know how to press. As Kane admitted, \"When the opponents are dropping a few players deeper we're not quite sure how to get the pressure on and who's supposed to be going.\"\n\n* Where is the football intelligence? England kept on passing slowly out from the back against Denmark even when it was obvious within a few minutes of kick-off that the approach was laced with danger on the ice-rink surface.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/06/1600x900/skysports-gareth-southagte_6586749.jpg?20240620184509", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Victor Kristiansen had no idea Kyle Walker was eating up the ground behind him and the Manchester City right-back got onto Bellingham's pass before sending a low cross into the box.\n\nTwo ricochets off Denmark defenders saw a chance fall kindly to Kane and the captain made no mistake on the six-yard line, guiding his effort into the far corner with Schmeichel given no chance.\n\nHowever, England's common tendency to drop reared its ugly head again. Loose passes gave Denmark possession time and time again and the Three Lions were punished when Hjulmand was given space to thrash a shot towards goal from 30 yards, hitting the inside of the post and bouncing over the line to equalise.\n\nKasper Hjulmand's side continued to press well at the start of the second half, disturbing an increasingly beleaguered England midfield that offered little obvious plan in and out of possession. Alexander-Arnold was dragged off before the hour mark before Foden smacked the post with a low effort from distance.\n\nFoden, Kane and Saka were brought off in a triple change but it didn't have the desired effect, with Denmark still looking the more likely to claim all three points.\n\nNo late winner arrived, however, with Southgate left with a lot to think about before his side's final group stage outing.\n\nGK: Kasper Schmeichel - 6/10 - Made a couple of smart saves and commanded his area well.\n\nCB: Joachim Andersen - 6/10 - Was comfortable enough defending deep and nodding crosses away.\n\nCB: Jannik Vestergaard - 5/10 - Looked slow and ponderous when England moved the ball quickly, which thankfully for him wasn't too often.\n\nCB: Andreas Christensen - 6/10 - Another of the Danish centre-backs who had a comfortable time dealing with England's passive attack.\n\nRWB: Joakim Maehle - 6/10 - Offered a willing runner up and down the right and picked up a caution.\n\nCM: Morten Hjulmand - 8/10 - Produced a fantastic hit from distance that brought the Danes back onto level terms. He and Hojbjerg were always a step ahead of England's midfield.\n\nCM: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - 7/10 - Got shot after shot away and nearly came close to bagging the winner late on. Won the ball back often.\n\nLWB: Victor Kristiansen - 5/10 - Awfully asleep to Walker's surging run as the Danes fell behind. Short pass assisted Hjulmand's cracker.\n\nAM: Christian Eriksen - 6/10 - Helped Denmark create the better openings and led their defensive effort well from the front.\n\nST: Rasmus Hojlund - 5/10 - Was crowded out by England's centre-backs whenever the ball arrived at his feet.\n\nSubs not used: Frederik Ronnow (GK), Mads Hermansen (GK), Mathias Jorgensen, Rasmus Kristensen, Simon Kjaer, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Mathias Jensen, Anders Dreyer, Kasper Dolberg.\n\nKasper Hjulmand - 6/10 - His side made a poor start but were helped by England's passiveness allowed them a route back into the game.\n\nGK: Jordan Pickford - 7/10 - The busier of the two goalkeepers, though Pickford often had simple long-range strikes to gather.\n\nRB: Kyle Walker - 6/10 - Brushed off an early injury scare to play a key part in the opening goal.\n\nCM: Trent Alexander-Arnold - 5/10 - Pinged a few long passes forward and got on the charge infrequently but was off before the hour mark having left a few too many holes in midfield.\n\nCM: Declan Rice - 4/10 - England needed his bursting runs from midfield to drag them out of their malaise but they didn't arrive.\n\nRW: Bukayo Saka - 5/10 - Started to run at his marker more often as the game progressed and got more joy, but was hooked alongside Kane and Foden.\n\nAM: Jude Bellingham - 5/10 - Much quieter in the opening 45 than he was against Serbia. Things didn't get much better in the second half.\n\nLW: Phil Foden - 6/10 - Skipped away from some challenges but made the wrong decisions in the opening 45 minutes. Hit the post with a nice effort from distance.\n\nST: Harry Kane - 6/10 - Showed typical composure to fire England into an early lead but his wayward pass helped Hjulmand equalise.\n\nSubs not used: Aaron Ramsdale (GK), Dean Henderson (GK), Ezri Konsa, Joe Gomez, Lewis Dunk, Adam Wharton, Kobbie Mainoo, Anthony Gordon, Cole Palmer, Ivan Toney\n\nGareth Southgate - 3/10 - A few experiments that Southgate has tested out need to be brought to an end quickly.

Kevin Keegan scored twice inside 21 minutes but Denmark were soon level courtesy of an Allan Simonsen penalty and a goal from Frank Arnesen.\n\nEngland regained their two-goal lead in the second half thanks to Bob Latchford and Phil Neal but just 13 seconds after England's fourth goal, Per Rontved got one back for Denmark. Despite this, England managed to hold on for the victory.\n\nRio Ferdinand got England up and running after netting inside the first five minutes, then a 22-year-old Michael Owen doubled the lead in the 22nd minute.\n\nJust before half-time, Emile Heskey joined the party with a goal to give Sven-Goran Eriksson's side a healthy lead going into the second half, which produced no further goals.\n\nA friendly in the summer of 2005 saw Denmark comfortably beat England in Copenhagen. Denmark scored three goals in eight second-half minutes through Dennis Rommedahl, Jon Dahl Tomasson and Michael Gravgaard.\n\nEngland managed to get one back in the 87th minute thanks to Wayne Rooney, however this was merely a consolation as in the second minute of added time Soren Larsen scored Denmark's fourth.\n\nGareth Southgate's side kept their Euro 2020 hopes alive by making their way into the final after overcoming a resilient Denmark side.\n\nIt was not simple for England as in the 30th minute Mikkel Damsgaard stuck a powerful free-kick into the top-left corner, leaving a flailing Jordan Pickford with no chance and putting the Danes 1-0 up.\n\nSoon after, England were back level after an own goal from a low Bukayo Saka cross was bundled in by an unlucky Simon Kjaer.\n\nEngland kept pushing but they could not beat Kasper Schmeichel until the 104th minute when Harry Kane followed in his saved penalty and made sure not to miss the rebound, sending England to the final.",

Harry Kane scored the first goal for England, before Morten Hjulmand netted an equaliser for Denmark.\n\nEngland now has their final group game of the tournament to play against Slovenia next Tuesday. Guaranteed progression to the last-16 appears almost certain, nonetheless, there's been concern regarding the strategy pursued by Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate.\n\nShearer voiced his criticism of England's tactics during the draw with Denmark. He contrasted Stones and Foden's roles at Manchester City under Pep Guardiola with the duo's impact for England at Euro 2024 thus far.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Phil Foden an England problem? No chance' - Man City proof, Southgate claim and 'step up' challenge\n\nREAD MORE: Man City face looming \u00a3100m transfer deadline\n\nSpeaking on BBC Sport, Shearer said: \"Let's use John Stones as an example. How many times do you see him get the ball and run into midfield, or get the ball with his back and turn in the Man City team? So many times. He's brilliant at it. How many times have you seen him do it in the last two England games? I can't remember any.\n\n\"How many times do you see Declan Rice getting that ball and bursting forward? How many times have you seen him do it in an England shirt in the last two games? None.\n\n\"How many times do you see Phil Foden get on the ball in the middle of the park, turn? Maybe once tonight when he had the shot and hit the post. So Gareth [Southgate] at the minute is not getting the best out of England's best players. It was very poor, it wasn't good enough,\" Shearer added, reflecting on England's performance.\n\n\"We've all been there as players, and yes you do try and take the positives, and yes it is tournament football. But it's our job and the coaches' jobs to dissect what went wrong, and there's plenty to look at there.\n\n\"Where do you start? No energy, no guile, I wouldn't say a lack of effort or not trying, but there's so much more to come from those players. I look at Jude [Bellingham] tonight, he couldn't put one foot in front of the other. He couldn't get forward.\n\n\"I look at Phil Foden on the left - is he affecting the game? No chance. I look at [Bukayo] Saka and Harry Kane, I know he [Kane] got his goal and I mentioned it on commentary about running in behind. At least when [Ollie] Watkins came on the defenders were running in behind. It was really poor and it is concerning, absolutely.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_wakefield@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Mark Wakefield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Slovenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Slovenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29394150.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_shearerjpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo appeared as substitutes at the weekend and are the most likely alternatives to the Liverpool star.\n\nEngland projected starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Pickford (GK) -- Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier -- Alexander-Arnold, Rice -- Foden, Bellingham, Saka -- Kane.\n\nKasper Hjulmand could similarly field an unchanged side, although Joakim Maehle could provide an attacking outlet at wing-back.\n\nManchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has seven goals in 15 international caps and will lead the line for his country once more.\n\nDenmark projected starting lineup (3-4-1-2): Schmeichel (GK) -- Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard -- Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen -- Eriksen -- Wind, Hojlund.\n\nYou have to go back to a 2014 friendly for the last time England beat Denmark in 90 minutes. The suffocating tension of that Euro 2020 semifinal came after a pair of Nations League meetings earlier in the 2020/21 season when the Scandinavians won 1-0 at Wembley and shared a 0-0 draw in Copenhagen.\n\nBoth teams taking a grip on their opening games before letting it slip suggests each will have their moments in the ascendency during this match.

It wasn't difficult to find either as Gareth Southgate named an unchanged lineup from the side that squeezed past Serbia in the opening match at Euro 2024.\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield and Phil Foden pushed out to the left wing once more, England supporters were quick to express their concerns.\n\nThe pitch didn't look in perfect condition as the game got underway in Frankfurt, with chunks of turf flying into the air with alarming regularity.\n\nKyle Walker was the first victim of the uneven surface on several occasions, even receiving treatment after twisting his ankle in the process of making a pass. Fortunately, the right-back was able to continue.\n\nHowever, a dodgy pitch couldn't stand in the way of England taking the lead against Denmark with their first real opportunity.\n\nA bursting run from Walker - whose ankle was seemingly unaffected by his earlier slip - and his deflected cross set up skipper Kane, who made no mistake to open the scoring with a simple finish.\n\nDenmark were quick to respond with some threatening attacks, unnerving a shaky and hesitant England backline. However, there was little that the Three Lions could do to stop Hjulmand's exquisite long-range strike to level the score. Well, other than close him down a bit quicker.\n\nOnce again, England had been caught napping as they sat deeper and deeper, with Denmark good value for their equaliser.

Morten Hjulmand scored a wonderful effort from 25-yards while Harry Kane opened his account for the tournament. Hojbjerg and Hjulmand were both impressive for Denmark.\n\nEngland were left frustrated on Thursday night, as their second game of EURO 2024 ended in a wildly unimpressive draw to Denmark.\n\nAfter some very cagey opening stages, which featured a number of players slipping on a torrid surface in Frankfurt, it was Harry Kane to open his account for the tournament, sliding home from close range after a ricocheted cross from Walker fell at his feet. The Danes stayed combative and hopeful amidst several careless giveaways from England, and Morten Hjulmand made them pay for one with a blockbusting 25-yard drive, which took a hit off the post before going in beyond the flailing Jordan Pickford.\n\nEngland continued to fail in their pursuits of possession, and looked largely lethargic throughout, giving away several important passes and lacking the cohesion they need to pass through a very stern Denmark spine. England recovered somewhat with the introduction of Ollie Watkins, who stretched the Danish defence more often with his pace in behind, but that was soon nullified by Denmark, who dominated England for their mistakes toward the back end of the match, with Hojbjerg and Bah both coming close to finding a winner.\n\nIt wasn't to be for either side, however, as England miss out on the chance to top the group, and Denmark hold them to a brilliant point to keep their chances alive.\n\nMatch Highlights England Player Ratings: GK - Jordan Pickford - 6/10\n\nMade a few good saves throughout, was helpless to Denmark's equaliser.\n\nRB - Kyle Walker - 6/10\n\nExcellent work in the buildup to England's opener, was the biggest casualty of the constant slips on the pitch. Some sloppy passes out on the right, but very good in the air.\n\nCB - John Stones - 5/10\n\nHis usually sound proficiency on the ball did not shine through in the first half. Sharpened up somewhat in the second. Had no license to get forward and push the midfield on.\n\nCB - Marc Guehi - 7/10\n\nDid well when Denmark came forward, which was plenty of times in comparison to England. Made a mistake against Bah in the final ten, but recovered with a superb slide in the box.\n\nLB - Kieran Trippier - 6/10\n\nComfortable, but not outstanding, at left-back. Made some smart tackles down the left.\n\nCM - Declan Rice - 4/10\n\nGave the ball away in some consistently dangerous areas. Did not sweep up the midfield how he usually does.\n\nCM - Trent Alexander-Arnold - 4/10\n\nSome smart long passes forward, but was bypassed several times in the center and somewhat sloppy with his shorter passes. The midfield experiment doesn't seem to be working. Hooked at 54' for Gallagher.\n\nAM - Jude Bellingham - 5/10\n\nHis first-half was a shadow of his one against Serbia. Was nullified by the Danish midfield in the first 45, and didn't seem to press much, similarly to his teammates. Found much more joy late in the day with more runs in behind to aim at.\n\nRW - Bukayo Saka - 5/10\n\nKept trying to get at Denmark, but was kept fairly quiet otherwise, either by Denmark or, seemingly, Southgate. Showed more spirit in the second half with a few attempts on goal, and a few more runs in behind. England's biggest threat until Watkins came on, which doesn't say much.\n\nLW - Phil Foden - 5/10\n\nJust as spirited than his Serbia showing, with several attempts from range, similarly ineffective. Hit the post early in the second half, but was withdrawn roughly 15 minutes later. Yet to click for him in this tournament.\n\nST - Harry Kane - 6/10\n\nOpened the scoring for England with a close-range effort. Didn't effect the game otherwise. Withdrawn for the pace and energy of Watkins to decent effect.\n\nSub - Conor Gallagher - 5/10\n\nAdded some graft and energy in an otherwise lethargic England press. Did his thankless job, but added little in possession.\n\nSub - Ollie Watkins - 6/10\n\nImmediately made a difference with a run in behind, found by Bellingham and saved by Schmeichel. Added a new, effective dynamic.\n\nSub - Eberechi Eze - N/A\n\nMade little impact when brought on in search of direction. Gave the ball away dangerously, but was let off with a foul.\n\nSub - Jarrod Bowen - N/A\n\nMade little impact.\n\nDenmark Player Ratings: GK - Kasper Schmeichel - 6/10\n\nDidn't have much to do in the first half. Kept Watkins and Foden out well in the second.\n\nCB - Joachim Andersen - 7/10\n\nHad little to do in the first half. Linked with the midfield and wingbacks nicely.\n\nCB - Andreas Christensen - 8/10\n\nWas accurate with all of his first-half passes and was in-passible by England.\n\nCB - Jannik Vestergaard - 6/10\n\nHad little to do in the first half, aside from a tactical foul on Saka which proved effective. Struggled to keep up with Watkins when he came on.\n\nRWB - Joakim Maehle - 7/10\n\nExcelled down the right-hand side. Always looking to get up and support. Spirited and full of stamina.\n\nLWB - Victor Kristiansen - 5/10\n\nMade a big mistake against Walker as England opened the scoring and couldn't contribute further forward like his fullback partner. Withdrawn early in the second half.\n\nCM - Morten Hjulmand - 8/10\n\nRestored parity with a delightful effort from range. Worked incredibly hard in the center of the park.\n\nCM - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - 9/10\n\nKept the Danish midfield ticking over superbly, made some key recoveries and was vital to the press that nullified England for so long.\n\nAM - Christian Eriksen - 7/10\n\nA constant worry for the England defense. Linked the midfield and attack superbly with some sharp passing.\n\nST - Rasmus Hojlund - 6/10\n\nDidn't impose much on the England back four, aside from plenty of energy. Withdrawn on the hour.\n\nST - Jonas Wind - 6/10\n\nGot the better of the England defence occasionally. Hooked early in the second.\n\nSub - Mikel Damsgaard - 6/10\n\nLooked spirited, found room on the flanks a few times. Tested Pickford with a hopeful drive on the hour.\n\nSub - Alexander Bah - 5/10\n\nLost possession on a fair few occasions. Not much more effective than Kristiansen, who he replaced.\n\nSub - Youssef Poulsen - N/A\n\nOnly touched the ball on a handful of occasions. Had no impact.\n\nSub - Christian Norgaard - N/A\n\nDidn't have time to make an impact.\n\nSub - Andreas Skov Olsen - N/A\n\nDidn't have time to make an impact.\n\nMan of the Match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg\n\nThe Tottenham man was the pick of the players in this stalemate, with the Danish midfielder absolutely superb in the press that kept England so quiet and threatened throughout.\n\nWhere England were lethargic, Hojbjerg was anything but, and allowed nobody in England white much more than 2-3 touches on the ball, where he could help it. Linked all areas of the pitch together superbly, and was a star man today to hold the Three Lions to a draw.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Bah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikkel_Damsgaard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikkel Damsgaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Wind", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Skov_Olsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Skov Olsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Andersen_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joachim Andersen (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Christensen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Christensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Driving_and_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Driving and Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Shooter", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Shooter", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-20-jun-2024-06-25-pm-5103.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Gareth Southgate's side at least sit at the top of Group C after the Danes were surprisingly held to a 1-1 draw by Slovenia on Sunday.\n\nPoignantly, Manchester United's Christian Eriksen scored the Dane's goal in his first Euros match since suffering a cardiac arrest during a group match against Finland at Euro 2020.\n\nAnother England win would send them through to the knockout stage with a game to spare, but it won't be easy in a repeat of the Euro 2020 semi-finals, which saw Denmark edged out after extra-time.

It's the middle game of the day after the other Group C clash between Slovenia and Serbia (2pm kick-off).\n\nWhere can I watch Denmark vs England?\n\nHaving covered the Serbia clash, the BBC have also got this game before ITV picked up the baton for the group finale against Slovenia on Tuesday. Coverage gets underway at 4pm and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker will be on duty with all the team news and build-up.\n\nIf you're on the move, the match will also be available to watch on iPlayer via your mobile device. If that isn't feasible, Alex Scott will present highlights of the game at 11.05pm on BBC2.\n\nMatch odds\n\nEngland are odds-on to make it two wins out of two. The Three Lions are 13/20 favourites while Denmark are 17/4 with BetVictor. The draw looks decent value at 5/2.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Questions have to be asked as to his positioning and misplaced pass for Denmark's equaliser, as well as his fitness. Replaced by Watkins in the 70th minute\n\nLooked like a man with a point to prove. Had four shots and with more licence to roam, was England's best attacking player. Rifled a shot onto the post in the second half, before being substituted for Bowen.\n\nBrilliant clearance just before the hour ahead of Christian Eriksen and once again shored up England's midfield.\n\nTook his knocks from Denmark after coming on, and executed himself well. No real inflential moments.\n\nAlmost got caught out soon after his introduction as Eriksen collected a pass, but was helped out by his team-mates. A tournament debut for the Crystal Palace winger.\n\nWithin minutes of coming on, had run in behind the Denmark defence to force a save from Kasper Schmeichel.

Their style, tactics, form and injuries are combining to go from bad to worse...\n\n* England's record scorer is now their biggest problem. Harry Kane missed Bayern Munich's final three matches and doesn't look fit. Having barely touched the ball against Serbia, he was statuesque against Denmark. Are England now carrying their captain?\n\n* England's form is worrying. With just two wins from their last seven matches, they would be relegation candidates if this was a club league.\n\n* And their performances have been even worse. There is no recognisable style of play, no discernible patterns of play other than the tactic of passing the ball to Bukayo Saka and hoping.\n\n* England are declining. They were poor against Serbia. They were worse against Denmark. As Kane said afterwards, \"We're struggling with and without the ball.\" In other words, they are really struggling full stop.\n\n* Gareth Southgate just doesn't seem able to rouse his troops. England were crying out for a rallying call at half-time. Instead they re-emerged devoid of energy.\n\n* Nor does Southgate - currently - seem able to unlock, particularly in attack, the performances from his players that they consistently deliver at a club level.\n\n* England's starting XI against Denmark proved remarkably unbalanced. Even with the defence too deep, a chasm still existed between the Declan Rice/Trent Alexander-Arnold pivot and Jude Bellingham. Better teams than Denmark will exploit the gaping holes. Then, with the defence still so far back, the gap between England's rearguard and midfield was simply unworkable.\n\n* Harry Maguire has his faults, but are England missing his leadership? It's the only obvious explanation for why the defence is sitting so deep. John Stones just doesn't seem able to exert any authority in an England shirt.\n\n* Phil Foden clearly doesn't want to play on the left. So he drifts inside to where Bellingham is stationed. Cue a midfield muddle and a lopsided team shape. Is it time to make the call: Foden or Bellingham?\n\n* Having finished his season as a No 8, Declan Rice suddenly looks uncomfortable as a No 6.\n\n* England's Euro 2024 squad had plenty of gambles but none more so than the inclusion of the injured Luke Shaw as the only recognised left-back. With the Manchester United defender's inactivity stretching into months rather than weeks, his ongoing unavailability through the opening group matches makes it extremely unlikely we will see him - the only left-footed left-back available - in the tournament.\n\n* And then there's the tactical gamble. Alexander-Arnold was England's first withdrawal against both Serbia and Denmark. Given that his exit against the Danes occurred just a few minutes into the second half, Southgate has surely accepted defeat in the midfield experiment that England have supposedly spent a year working on. So what now?\n\n* Bellingham looks shattered. Just as worryingly, it looks as if England don't know where to play him. Is he really a No 10?\n\n* It doesn't help that the rest of the tournament has been so good. It only highlights how laboured and lethargic England's displays have been.\n\n* Where is the football intelligence? England kept on passing slowly out from the back against Denmark even when it was obvious within a few minutes of kick-off that the approach was laced with danger on the ice-rink surface.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/06/1600x900/skysports-gareth-southagte_6586749.jpg?20240620184509", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The goal draws him level with Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as the players to score for England at the most major tournaments, with four apiece.\n\nDenmark were the better team after that, however, and an equaliser felt inevitable.\n\nThe Danes capitalised on England's sloppy play in the 34th minute when Kane's pass up the field from a throw-in went to Kristiansen, who passed to Hjulmand. The 24-year-old launched a rocket from about 30 yards out that ricocheted off the left post and into the net.\n\nEngland keeper Jordan Pickford barely saw it coming, and waved a frustrated finger at his team mates.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/06/21/FBL-EURO-2024-MATCH17-DEN-ENG-181833.jpg?VersionId=fBowK5QVWLIYYTrgOhOxbOeSDngcqja7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 141, "textEnd": 148}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo appeared as substitutes at the weekend and are the most likely alternatives to the Liverpool star.\n\nEngland projected starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Pickford (GK) -- Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier -- Alexander-Arnold, Rice -- Foden, Bellingham, Saka -- Kane.\n\nKasper Hjulmand could similarly field an unchanged side, although Joakim Maehle could provide an attacking outlet at wing-back.\n\nManchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has seven goals in 15 international caps and will lead the line for his country once more.\n\nDenmark projected starting lineup (3-4-1-2): Schmeichel (GK) -- Andersen, Christensen, Vestergaard -- Bah, Hjulmand, Hojbjerg, Kristiansen -- Eriksen -- Wind, Hojlund.\n\nYou have to go back to a 2014 friendly for the last time England beat Denmark in 90 minutes. The suffocating tension of that Euro 2020 semifinal came after a pair of Nations League meetings earlier in the 2020/21 season when the Scandinavians won 1-0 at Wembley and shared a 0-0 draw in Copenhagen.\n\nBoth teams taking a grip on their opening games before letting it slip suggests each will have their moments in the ascendency during this match.

Neal Maupay mocked England's struggles, while Alan Shearer criticised Southgate's tactics. Jordan Henderson urged fans to trust the team, while Daniel Sturridge questioned Cole Palmer's absence.\n\nEngland's Euro 2024 campaign resumed with an underwhelming performance against Denmark as the two nations drew 1-1 on Thursday night. After Serbia equalised late against Slovenia earlier in the day, Gareth Southgate's side knew a win would confirm their status as Group C winners and guarantee a place in the knockout stages with a game to spare.\n\nDespite struggling in the second half against Serbia, the manager named an unchanged side against Denmark. It was a tremendous show of faith from Southgate for the likes of Phil Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who drew criticism from fans online - but it was a gamble that didn't pay off.\n\nRelated England 1-1 Denmark: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nEngland were off the boil as Denmark were left unlucky to draw in their Euro 2024 clash.\n\nEngland were poor and, despite taking the lead early through Harry Kane, spent the majority of the match on the back foot and were fortunate to come away from the contest with anything at all. In truth, it was a disappointing match, but here are five things from the match that you might have missed.\n\nNeal Maupay Pokes Fun at England The Frenchman couldn't resist having a laugh on social media\n\nWhile England's struggles won't leave any Three Lions' fan happy, rival supporters are certainly seeing the funnier side - and one man who couldn't resist poking fun at the team was Brentford striker, Neal Maupay. The Frenchman, who has earned a reputation for the manner in which he antagonises opposition players and fans, hopped onto social media at full-time and mocked England and the notion that football could be coming home this summer. Check out his viral tweet below:\n\nIt was brutal from Maupay, but it's far from the first time he's poked fun online at the expense of others. Just a couple of weeks ago, for example, the 27-year-old had a dig at James Maddison when the Tottenham man was left out of the England squad for Euro 2024.\n\nShearer Believes Southgate Is England's Problem He doesn't think the coach is getting the best out of his players\n\nSpeaking shortly after the match concluded, Gary Lineker spoke to Alan Shearer and asked him why he thought players like Foden, who entered the tournament off the back of an exceptional season with Manchester City, were struggling to make any impact at Euro 2024 so far. The Premier League's all-time leading goalscorer was brutally honest with his response\"\n\n\"Well, let's use John Stones as an example. How many times do you see him get the ball and run into midfield or get the ball and turn in the Man City team? So many times. He's brilliant at it. How many times have you seen him do it in the last two England games? I can't remember any.\n\n\"How many times do you see Declan Rice getting that ball and bursting forward? How many times have you seen him do it in an England shirt in the last two games? None. How many times do you see Phil Foden get on the ball in the middle of the park and turn? Maybe once tonight when he had the shot and hit the post. Gareth at the minute is not getting the best out of England's best players.\"\n\nIt's a damning statement from Shearer, but there won't be many England fans out there who disagree with his comments after the first two matches at Euro 2024.\n\nRelated 3 Things Gareth Southgate Got Wrong During Denmark 1-1 England\n\nEngland no longer look like Euro 2024 favourites after another dismal performance against Denmark - and Southgate has questions to answer.\n\nJordan Henderson Defends England The midfielder backed the team\n\nAfter watching England struggle through their first two games of Euro 2024, fans have grown restless and are voicing their frustration with the side both online and in the stadium. Boos could be heard during the Three Lions' draw with Denmark, while many posted on social media about the performance. But one man who thinks supporters should instead continue to have faith in the side is former Southgate favourite Jordan Henderson.\n\nThe midfielder, who has represented England at multiple major tournaments under Southgate took to Instagram and shared footage from Kyle Walker's post-match interview. He backed the full-back for his comments, pleaded with fans to get behind the squad and claimed there was too much negativity towards them right now.\n\nDaniel Sturridge Questions Cole Palmer's Absence The former striker is shocked at the star's lack of minutes\n\nHeading into Euro 2024, there were few England forwards who had contributed to more goals during the 2023-24 season than Cole Palmer. He had a stellar campaign at Chelsea, but despite the Three Lions' issues creating many chances going forward, he's yet to see a single minute of international football since the tournament got underway. Daniel Sturridge is very confused about that. The pundit made sure to let the world know that too, with a post on social media.\n\nSturridge will be far from the only fan who is baffled at the lack of minutes for Palmer. Something clearly isn't clicking within the England team right now, and it's led to two very lacklustre and lethargic performances offensively. With Southgate needing to find a solution, it's bizarre he hasn't turned to the proven goalscorer yet.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Cole Palmer contributed to 42 goals during the 2023-24 season\n\nJamie Carragher Blasts England's Boring Matches Pundit claims England have had two of the most boring games at Euro 2024\n\nFor the most part, Euro 2024 has delivered so far. There have already been some incredible matches and moments throughout the first week of the tournament. Unfortunately for England fans, though, their national team's two matches have been dull in comparison to what they've seen elsewhere - and Jamie Carragher voiced that sentiment on X.\n\nThe pundit took to the social media site and posted about how entertaining the European Championship has been so far, but also highlighted how England's two matches have been some of the poorest in the whole tournament. It's far from the entertaining, free-flowing football that they should be playing considering the talent on paper.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Transfermarkt and accurate as of 20/06/2024.",

Once again, a bright start was rewarded with an early goal. Once again, it was followed by the team ceding the initiative and sinking deeper and deeper into their own half.\n\nThis tendency to invite pressure is not new. It has been a curious feature of Gareth Southgate's tenure. But mostly it has occurred in knockout games against the big nations. Not in group-stage fixtures against sides sitting outside the top 20 in the FIFA rankings.\n\nIt is baffling that a group of players as good as this, a group regarded as favourites to win the tournament, can end up playing like an underdog in games such as these but that is the reality of what they served up, first against Serbia and now against Denmark.\n\nOf course, that is not to say these are easy fixtures. Tournament football can be unforgiving. But the Denmark game was just the latest in which England have invited problems by inviting pressure. It led to Denmark's leveller and it could have been worse.\n\nThe statistics were alarming. Denmark, in addition to outshooting England, made slightly more passes and had slightly more of the ball. But consider, too, where they had it compared to England. Denmark had 22 touches in the opposition box to England's 11. They made 142 passes in the final third to England's 97.\n\nIt is not as though England lack the personnel to play higher up the pitch. In Kyle Walker and the excellent Marc Guehi, they have quick defenders able to sweep up behind a high line. In midfield and attack, they have players drilled to play in exactly that way for their clubs.\n\nWhy, then, does the same issue keep resurfacing? A degree of pragmatism is understandable at a tournament. But England are causing themselves unnecessary problems.\n\nRarely has a midfield containing so much talent looked as disjointed as this one.\n\nMaybe that shouldn't be surprise given this was only the third time, after a 1-0 Nations League loss to Hungary in June 2022 and Sunday's opener against Serbia, that Declan Rice, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jude Bellingham have started a game together centrally.\n\nSouthgate's determination to get Alexander-Arnold into his line-up is of course understandable given the qualities he possesses. But is a major tournament the right place to trial a new-look midfield? On this evidence, the answer is an emphatic no.\n\nRice, impressive but overworked against Serbia, was overrun on occasions this time, the gaps to Alexander-Arnold and Bellingham too great, with the former eventually sacrificed, making way for Conor Gallagher only nine minutes after half-time.\n\nGallagher does not possess the same level of vision and passing ability as Alexander-Arnold but he brought more energy and security alongside Rice. He will fancy his chances of starting against Slovenia. But England's midfield remains a major work-in-progress.\n\nHarry Kane's goal, slotted home from close-range from Kyle Walker's deflected cut-back, made him only the third player to score for England at four different major tournaments behind only Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. But this was a tough afternoon for him.\n\nAs against Serbia, he was a peripheral figure. And when he did get on the ball, it was mostly as a result of dropping deep, into areas where he did more harm than good, as shown by the woefully misplaced pass from the left-back position which led to Denmark's goal.\n\nThe problem, though, was that when he wasn't dropping deep, he cut an isolated figure upfield, too far away from England's defenders and midfielders to be a useful outlet.\n\nThe lack of support is something for Southgate to ponder as he prepares his team to face Slovenia but there are off-the-ball question marks over Kane too.\n\nHe looks tired after a long season with Bayern Munich which ended with a back injury. And even at his freshest, his pressing is not his strength. Ollie Watkins, his replacement in the second half, gave England more in that regard. Kane's spot is under scrutiny.\n\nKane was just one of many England players who looked oddly fatigued against Denmark but Bellingham's lack of energy relative to the Serbia game stood out even more.\n\nThe 20-year-old appeared to put any questions of burnout to bed with his excellent individual display on Sunday but this game was a different story. There were glimpses of his brilliance, including an incisive through-ball to release Watkins late on. But not much more.\n\nHis exhaustion was summed up in the closing stages when, having been sold short by a poor Kyle Walker pass, he simply could not muster the energy to chase back, allowing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to charge forward and fire an effort narrowly wide.\n\nIt is hardly surprising if he is feeling jaded after an epic first season at Real Madrid which only finished with their Champions League final win over Real Madrid on June 1. But, given his importance, it will be difficult to grant him any rest until England's tournament is over.\n\nThis was a much better performance from Phil Foden after a hard-working but largely fruitless showing against Serbia. It was telling, though, that his best work, including one dancing dribble through midfield and several efforts on goal, came from central positions.\n\nThe 24-year-old had clearly been encouraged to drift infield but England's left-sided conundrum remains. With the right-footed Kieran Trippier playing as a makeshift left-back, Southgate's team carries precious little threat on that flank.\n\nThe lopsided-ness is not an issue when England's right flank delivers as it did for Bellingham's goal against Serbia, set up by Bukayo Saka, and Kane's goal against Denmark, set up by Walker. But this level of reliance is surely not sustainable.\n\nLuke Shaw is a huge miss. Southgate hinted that the 28-year-old, the only natural left-back in the squad, may not recover from his injury in time to feature in the group stage.\n\nThe worry is that, even when he is deemed fit, he will not have played a competitive fixture since February. Throwing him into the team for the knockout stages would carry obvious risks. The question is whether England's need on that side forces the decision.\n\nEngland's performances so far have raised concerns over numerous individuals but their collective problems are arguably more concerning. The lack of creativity has been stark.\n\nSouthgate's side mustered a meagre total of only 0.52 expected goals in the Serbia game, a clear indication of the low quality of chances created, and, at 0.85, the number was not much higher against Denmark. The Danes were comfortable for most of the contest.\n\nThis issue is intertwined with their propensity to drop so deep. You cannot threaten the opposition goal if you don't get near it. But even when England do manage to get into dangerous positions, they are struggling to make them count.\n\nThe hope for England fans is that, ultimately, none of this will matter. Southgate's side have taken four points from a possible six. They are on course to reach the knockout stages, however unconvincingly.

In general, when the teams drop a few players deeper we're not sure how to the get the pressure on and who's supposed to be going.\n\n\"In the second half we tried to change it a bit with me and Jude [Bellingham] playing in front of their two midfielders and then trying to get up. But it was difficult: credit to Denmark, they're a really good side and they caused us some threats.\n\n\"We're struggling with and without the ball. The pressing in both games hasn't been quite right, and with the ball we haven't been good enough - that's from top to bottom, from me to Picks. Everyone's dropping below their level in terms of retaining the ball and playing under pressure. It was tough out there with the heat and the pitch. It wasn't our greatest game but we got away with a draw.\"\n\nThe result means England have effectively qualified for the last-16 and they remain well-placed to win the group ahead of Tuesday's meeting with Slovenia in Cologne.\n\nKane pointed out that England drew 0-0 with Scotland in a flat performance in their second group game of Euro 2020, when they went on to reach the final.\n\n\"There's no easy games at major tournaments and I think that's being shown,\" he said.\n\n\"There are levels we can reach, with and without the ball, but it's a sign of a good team that you can get results when you're not playing well.\n\n\"We're top of the group and we've all but qualified. I know there'll be loads of noise and a bit of disappointment at home, but we experienced this when we drew with Scotland in the last Euros. It's a time to stay calm, reflect and try to improve. Step by step, we'll get there.\"\n\nSouthgate acknowledged that England lacked intensity off the ball but believes they do not have the personnel or fitness up front to press high up the pitch.\n\n\"We pressed slightly differently, which meant that [Phil] Foden was starting a little bit more in field,\" the manager said.\n\n\"But our press wasn't intense enough and it meant that our backline had a problem with the players dropping either side of our pivots. So, that's something that has to be better. We know with the profile of players that we've got, we don't feel the way to press is really high up the pitch.\n\n\"I don't think that's the physical level of the team at the moment either.

Their showing in this game was even worse, with Denmark having been the better side for the majority of the contest.\n\nGareth Southgate's tactics were under the microscope before this tournament even began, with the scrutiny only likely to intensify over the coming days. He is certainly not getting the most out of the talented squad at his disposal.\n\nSome prominent voices in English football have already grown tired with the team's approach in Germany.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC after the game, Rio Ferdinand struggled to mask the frustration he felt with England and their setup during the draw with Denmark.\n\nLacklustre, lacked any sort of direction in my eyes, tactically well below par.\n\nWe were overshadowed tactically I thought by a Denmark team. You have to give them that respect, they were well drilled and tactically superior, they pressed us better and forced England to look very average.\n\nWe highlighted before the game about sitting back. Our best players and most decisive players are at the top of the pitch and we choose to set up like that?\n\nWe've got too good of players to set ourselves up tactically to sit back and wait and hope to get through the game. We need to get to the bottom of whether they're being told to do this or if the players are being forced to do this by the opposition.\n\nAt the moment, it doesn't look good for them as individuals, but more importantly as a team...\n\nIt just concerns me when you see the standard of players we have out there...\n\nThe players don't the same players we see for their clubs. It happened in my generation, so I understand exactly what it is.\n\nJohn Stones is there, he's an absolutely perfect centre back coming out with the ball. He looks far from it there. He comes into the midfield when he has the freedom to do it in the team structure. I don't think the team balance is allowing the players to perform at their best.\n\nFoden isn't playing in his best position and isn't performing at his best. Jude Bellingham would maybe be better off as an 'eight', all the best things he done was from the 'eight' position.\n\nThe balance of the team is a big concern.\n\nEngland remain top of their Euro 2024 group, with a game against Slovenia still to come. While they should comfortably make the knockout stages, their performances so far are not fitting of a team that the English media had deemed as favourites to win the tournament.\n\nIf they fall flat over the coming weeks, it is likely that Gareth Southgate will take the blame.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary Connaughton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNlxcXC8yMDE5MTMxNVxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wNi0yMFQxOTEyNDQuMjg3LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJjYzFiZmM3ZWRkNzdiZWMxNzgyN2EyNTFhNmMwNDMzZjA1NThmMWZmIn0=/rioferdinandalreadylosingtheheadafterenglanddrawwithdenmarkballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Step by step, we'll get there.\"\n\n\"I know there will probably loads of noise and a bit of disappointment back home, but we experienced this in the last Euros as well when we drew to Scotland.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Img38365326.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

First the right-back squared a pass to his Manchester City team-mate Phil Foden, who did well to create space for himself but shot high and wide.\n\nThen, on 18 minutes, came the breakthrough which was a personal nightmare for Danish wing-back Victor Kristiansen.\n\nWhile Walker blue-lighted it down the flank, Kristiansen appeared to be towing a caravan and, as he dawdled, the City man robbed him.\n\nWalker's cut back deflected off Andreas Christensen, allowing Kane to prod home from six yards.\n\nIt was the skipper's 13th goal at major tournaments - three more than any other Englishman has managed.\n\nBut England failed to capitalise - they were shoddy in their passing and panicky at the back.\n\nJordan Pickford had a mad five minutes - allowing Christian Eriksen to steal the ball from him in the six-yard box but Alexander-Arnold intercepted before Rasmus Hojlund could finish.\n\nSoon the England keeper was flapping at a cross and after an Alexander-Arnold error, Marc Guehi's attempted clearance was deflected on to the roof of the net.\n\nDenmark were far more assured in their passing and they fully deserved their equaliser.\n\nFrom a Kieran Trippier throw-in deep in England's half, Kane played a stray pass which Kristiansen intercepted, teeing up Hjulmand for a 30-yard drilled home off the post.\n\nIt wasn't an absolute clanger from Pickford but from such a range, he will feel he should have saved it.\n\nThe Danish fans started performing a Viking thunderclap - bringing back unfortunate memories of Iceland - England grew increasingly frustrated.\n\nFoden started shaping up like Diego Maradona at the Azteca Stadium but after an impressive dribble he failed to play the obvious pass to Kane, who was visibly fuming.\n\nIt was a pretty miserable 45 minutes, at least as poor as England's second half against Serbia.\n\nThe second period began in more upbeat fashion and Alexander-Arnold produced his best moment just as Southgate was preparing to substitute him.\n\nThe Liverpool man's dipping long-range pass released Saka, who couldn't control it, then headed into the side-netting.\n\nThe Alexander-Arnold experiment was put to bed when Conor Gallagher replaced him on 54th minute.\n\nSoon after Saka fed Foden, who pinged a shot against the post from outside the area.\n\nAgain, though, it started getting ragged from England - a Declan Rice error allowed Eriksen a sight at goal but the Manchester United man shot over.\n\nThen midway through the second half, Southgate made a drastic triple change, withdrawing his front three of Kane, Saka and Foden and sending on Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze.\n\nIt did not take long before Watkins was testing Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nFirst, Bellingham produced a sweet pass but the Danish keeper advanced to deny Watkins with his body.\n\nSchmeichel pushed another Watkins effort around the post and England were re-energised.\n\nYet there were still moments of worry. Rice's poor pass almost let in Alexander Bah, but the excellent Marc Guehi receovered.\n\nThen Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg curled one wide from the edge of trhe box as the Danes finished strongly.",

We've had two games in a short turnaround and we needed fresh legs, energy to press,\" he told the BBC. \"I think Harry has only had one 90 minutes in over a month so that was the decision we took.\n\n\"There's a huge amount of work, that's evident from the two performances we've given and we've got to be tight. We understand people will be disappointed with the performances and rightly so and we've got to make them better.\"\n\nKane had just 24 touches in England's opener against Serbia, including only two in the first half, and Gary Lineker believes Southgate needs to ask for more from his captain. \"As a striker you have two jobs, score goals, which Harry Kane has been good at all his career, and make space,\" the former England striker said.\n\n\"He needs his manager to come to him and ask a little bit more of him. I would have expected that if I'd put in that kind of performance. Against a back three he has to stretch the play, run one way and then come short so you don't have to come too far to receive it.\n\n\"He needs to make more space for the midfield players behind him to create chances.\" Fellow ex-striker Alan Shearer suggested Kane needs the players around him to make space, suggesting Anthony Gordon should start England's final group game against Slovenia.\n\n\"As I got older I needed pace in and around me,\" Shearer explained. \"I could still score goals, head the ball, get into positions in the box, but one thing I could not do is run in behind. Harry Kane is the same now.\n\n\"He needs players that have the legs to run beyond and make the space. That's why I would have Anthony Gordon in the team, Phil Foden is occupying the same spaces as Kane at the moment and it's not working.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

CLICK HERE TO ADD TO YOUR BETSLIP.\n\nThursday, June 20 - 5pm: Denmark v England\n\nEuro 2024 Group C match at Waldstadion, Frankfurt\n\nWhere to watch: BBC One, RTE2, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport Website\n\nEngland will click into the groove and get better as the tournament goes on. I think they'll have too much for Denmark but it will be an even tougher game than the one against Serbia.\n\nI still fancy us to win and we'll probably play better than we did against Serbia but it will be tight, something like 2-1 to England.\n\nEngland have too many players who can hurt Denmark and it only takes a couple to be on it to make the difference as we saw with Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka on Sunday.\n\nWe were fantastic down the right-hand side against Serbia with Kyle Walker and Saka going at them, that scares anyone in world football. There was a slight issue on the left.\n\nKieran Tripper played well even though he was slightly out of position and Phil Foden didn't look himself. There will be improvements there but Bellingham was a class act and we need to get Harry Kane into the game more.\n\nDefensively England were good and that's the area most people seem to be most worried about so that was a definite positive. I just think everyone will get better through the tournament and this will be another step forward.\n\nKane had such a quiet game and he was barely involved. He only had two touches in the first half but, barring an unbelievable save, he almost came away from the game with a goal.\n\nIf that goes in he's up and running and on the Golden Boot leaderboard but you can never, ever write him off. You have to play him every game and he's a huge threat whatever's actually happening on the pitch.\n\nBellingham put in an all-action display, he was everywhere, putting in tackles, winning headers and he was aggressive.\n\nHe's got the touch and the ability to get past people and he plays the right pass at the right time.\n\nHe's got excellent timing when arriving into the box as we saw for the goal. It was just fantastic and he was brave to get in there and score it.\n\nHis confidence will have grown a little more, if that's even possible, and he should be a big threat again on Thursday.\n\nPeople sill be scared of Saka bombing down that right-hand side. They will have watched videos of him coming inside for Arsenal but he's got the intelligence to go down the line and mix it up down the outside.\n\nAt Arsenal he doesn't really have that No.9 to get to the byline and aim for but at England he's got Kane and there's few better players on the planet you'd want to be aiming for and rely on to get into the box.\n\nIf you're going on the outside, as he did against Serbia, you need someone to cross to. Playing for your country is obviously different than your club and he's adapted wonderfully, even though he's playing in the same position.\n\nChristian Eriksen's goal for Denmark against Slovenia was fantastic but it could be Rasmus Hojlund that gives England most to think about. He played well in their first game and looked full of confidence, more so that he has at Manchester United anyway.\n\nEriksen is a class act, he makes them tick, and Denmark have caused us problems in games before. We always seem to end up playing Denmark, we usually manage to get past them, and I can't see anything different happening this time.\n\nAll prices are bang up to date with our snazzy widgets, while odds in copy are accurate at time of publishing but subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "news.paddypower.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddy Power News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_crouch@news.paddypower.com", "name": "Peter Crouch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC iPlayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion_(Frankfurt)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waldstadion (Frankfurt)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://news.paddypower.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/crouch-denmarkvenglandtips.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 127, "textEnd": 134}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

And England were unable to respond, with Denmark ultimately having more shots and more possession.\n\n\"I think we said before the tournament there's no easy games and I think that's showing,\" Kane told the BBC after the game. \"We've got levels we can reach and we can be better both with and without the ball.\n\n\"I think the sign of a good team is when you're not playing at your best and still find a way to get results like we have in the last two games.

We know we can improve.\n\n\"I know there will probably loads of noise and a bit of disappointment back home but we experienced this in the last Euros as well when we drew to Scotland.

There's another level we've got to find.\n\n\"We've played teams that are quite fluid and we're not getting pressure on them. Keeping the ball has also been a big part of the problem.

The role is specific and in some respects old-school; to play as much as possible on the shoulder of the last defender, stay on the fringe of the action as the midfielders assume all the creative responsibilities, patiently awaiting one moment to strike.\n\n'The problem with a player of Kane's many abilities is that it reduces his effectiveness by 50 per cent. Kane is a multi-tasking, modern centre-forward who was reduced to one-dimension during the 1-0 win over Serbia.\n\n'If Southgate persists with the same system for the rest of the tournament, his No 9 will be heavily compromised. Possibly too much. Having come into the Euros with a Phil Foden conundrum, after one game Southgate has a Kane one.\n\n'In the first half, Kane registered just two touches of the ball. For a player of his class, that is deeply worrying.\n\n'By full time that had risen to 24, showing that he was more involved in the second half - ironic given that England were less dominant in possession. There is a tactical curiosity that when England played well, Kane was not involved at all. When they didn't, he nearly scored and had more possession.'\n\nAccording to Carragher, a distinct lack of sheer pace 'hurt' England and there was 'too much responsibility' on Bukayo Saka to make runs in behind Serbia's obstinate defence.\n\n'I have always distinguished the best centre-forwards between great players and great goalscorers. Haaland is a great scorer. Kane is a great player who scores lots of goals,' the former Liverpool and England centre-back added.\n\n'The reason he is world class is because he does not need to score to have an impact on a game. At his best, he is a goalscoring No 9, a false 9 and a creative No 10.\n\n'Redefining him as a poacher to accommodate so many team-mates who want to occupy the deep, No 10 position will be the most contentious decision Southgate makes if England are unsuccessful.'\n\nCarragher continued: 'Kane is at his best when he is surrounded by pace. At the last three international tournaments, he liked to drop deep and supply passes to rapid wide strikers like Bukayo Saka and Raheem Sterling, or (when selected) Marcus Rashford.\n\n'Even when England were in control during the first 30 minutes against Serbia, Saka was the only attacker running beyond the defence. He was brilliant, but there was too much responsibility on him to make those runs.\n\n'The lack of pace hurt England the longer the game progressed, so it was surprising Anthony Gordon was not introduced. There is also an argument that Ollie Watkins should have replaced Kane for the last 20 minutes because he is quicker and could have freshened it up physically.\n\n'True, Kane nearly had his reward when he forced an impressive save on 77 minutes. Like Haaland, interpretations of whether he played well or not become defined by such opportunities.'\n\nMORE : Gary Neville slams Arsenal defender for 'getting carried away' during Scotland's Euro

Replaced by Conor Gallagher in the 53rd minute.\n\nJude Bellingham - 5\n\nWasn't able to take the game by the scruff of the neck as he so often does and didn't quite get going.\n\nBukayo Saka - 5\n\nDenmark clearly had a plan for him after seeing the damage he did to Serbia in the first game. Offered a threat with his running in behind but not his best England display.\n\nPhil Foden - 5\n\nShowed some promise when popping up in his favourite positions, including one slaloming run in the first half and a strike against the post in the second. But we are still not seeing him excel on the international stage.\n\nHarry Kane - 5\n\nThe skipper scored his 64th England goal with a composed left-footed finish but his overall showing wasn't all that impressive. He gave away the ball cheaply from a throw-in for Denmark's leveller and him dropping deep left England a little short in attack. Taken off for Watkins.\n\nCame on for Alexander-Arnold and was booked not long after entering the fray.\n\nOllie Watkins - 6\n\nBrought on for Kane and immediately stretched the game with constant running in behind, giving Denmark a new kind of problem.\n\nJarrod Bowen - 5\n\nUnlike against Serbia, struggled to make too much of an impact.\n\nEberechi Eze - 5\n\nOne glimpse of what he's all about with a pass in behind that just evaded Watkins.", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt5c85826bd3cbb6f3/6674648be86ae96d7114fa8c/448418214_1006336907724747_1154412179386042792_n.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Manager Gareth Southgate will be well aware that it was far from a standout performance, with his team losing control and creating few opportunities in the second half.\n\nDenmark, managed by Kasper Hjulmand, suffered their own disappointing result following a 1-1 draw with Slovenia, though past clashes with England have shown they still pose a great threat with the abundance of top talent they possess. And MEN has pinpointed five dangermen who England must identify and keep tabs on - including two Manchester United stars.\n\nREAD MORE: Rasmus Hojlund highlights Man Utd failures - Sir Alex Ferguson wouldn't have signed him\n\nREAD MORE: Serbia fined for breaking UEFA rules in Euro 2024 match vs England\n\nRasmus Hojlund\n\nRasmus Hojlund finished his first season at Old Trafford with 16 goals across all competitions. That included an impressive five in six matches in the Champions League - yet the 21-year-old's form for his country is even more eye-catching.\n\nWith seven goals in eight Euro 2024 qualifying matches, he is undoubtedly Denmark's star striker - and he almost scored another against Slovenia but for an excellent save by Jan Oblak. England centre-backs John Stones and Marc Guehi will need to manage his pace on the counter, and handle his darting runs into the six-yard box.\n\nAndreas Christensen\n\nAt the opposite end of the pitch is Andreas Christensen, well known to English football fans from his time at Chelsea. Christensen's duel with Harry Kane promises to be fascinating - but his influence in the opposition box should not be underestimated.\n\nThe central defender scored crucial headers for Barcelona last season in El Clasico and against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-finals, with his very first touch of the ball. England must stay alert to his movement during set pieces.\n\nChristian Eriksen\n\nProviding Christensen and his Red Devils team-mate Hojlund with pinpoint crosses will be Christian Eriksen, who enjoyed a dream start to the Euros by scoring a stunning volley in their opener, 1,100 days after suffering a cardiac arrest at the 2021 edition of the tournament. The United midfielder has been Denmark's talisman for over a decade, as shown by his two man of the match performances in qualifying.\n\nThe 32-year-old was instrumental in creating chances against Slovenia, causing havoc with his corners and free-kicks, but is equally skilled at breaking down defences from open play. England will need to contain him if they are to nullify Denmark's threat, with Declan Rice set for a busy evening.\n\nPierre-Emile Hojberg\n\nDenmark's midfield is marshalled by Tottenham's Pierre-Emile Hojberg. The veteran's role will be crucial in the midfield contest which could determine the outcome of the game - and his two goals in qualifying showed he can also deliver big moments.\n\nEngland's midfield was outplayed in the second half against Serbia, and there's a real risk of being overrun by Denmark. The Danes dominated possession (68%) with an impressive 88% pass accuracy against Slovenia, and boasted the fourth highest possession in Euros qualifying (64%).\n\nJonas Wind\n\nDenmark will chase a victory after dropping two points to a late Slovenia equaliser on Sunday. The Danes had taken the lead after just 17 minutes of play thanks to a masterful flick from Jonas Wind to set-up Eriksen.\n\nThe Wolfsburg forward could prove a handful for England's defenders, having notched 11 goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga last season. Only Bukayo Saka and Harry Kane have netted more for England than the eight he has scored for Denmark.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester

It is tournament football and it is our job to dissect what has gone wrong and there is plenty to look at there. Where do you start? No energy, no guile. I would not say lack of effort but there is so much more to come from those players.\n\n\"Look at Jude [Bellingham] tonight, he could not get one foot in front of another. He could not get forward. I look at Phil Foden, is he affecting the game? No chance. I look at [Bukayo] Saka and Kane. I know he got his goal, but I said on commentary about running in behind. It was really poor. It is concerning, absolutely.\n\n\"Use John Stones as an example. How many times do you see him step into midfield and turn his back and run with the ball in a Man City team?\n\n\"He is brilliant at it. How many times have you seen it in the last two England games? Not many. How many times do you see Declan Rice get the ball and go on a bursting run? None. How many times do you see Foden get the ball and turn, maybe once tonight when he hit the post. Gareth at the minute is not getting the best out of England's best players.\"\n\nRio Ferdinand, also a BBC pundit and former England player, agreed with Shearer by adding: \"The current balance of the team is not allowing the players to reach the levels that they have done for clubs.\n\n\"Phil Foden is out of position and not playing his best, maybe Jude Bellingham would be better playing at number eight. It is a big concern.\"\n\nHarry Kane's decision to continue to drop deep also came under criticism from Shearer who called for the England captain to be taken off in place for Ollie Watkins which Southgate finally did in the 70th-minute.\n\nShearer, who scored 30 goals in 62 appearances for England, also called for Southgate to pair Kane with players who are willing to run in behind after suggesting Kane is going through a similar experience to himself when he reached over 30 and started to see his pace dwindle.\n\n\"As I got older I needed pace in and around me,\" Shearer added. \"I could still score goals, head the ball, get into positions in the box, but one thing I could not do is run in behind. Harry Kane is the same now, he needs players that have the legs to run beyond and make the space.\n\n\"That's why I would have Anthony Gordon in the team, Phil Foden is occupying the same spaces as Kane at the moment and it's not working. He is a brilliant goal scorer and he will always score goals but what he lacks is that yard and energy. Someone else can do it alongside him.\n\n\"It is one of the reasons why I retired from international football. I could not do it for Newcastle and England with my lack of place. Harry is not the quickest, he needs pace in and around him and that is why I would play Gordon.\"\n\nFellow former England striker and BBC pundit Gary Lineker added: \"In all honesty, I think Harry Kane needs to do a lot better.\n\n\"His movement was minimal. He did not look to get in behind and he doesn't often but even when he is coming short he is doing it lethargically and plodding short.\n\n\"As a striker you have two jobs, score goals, which Harry Kane has been good at all his career, and make space. He needs his manager to come to him and ask a little bit more of him.\n\n\"I would have expected that if I'd put in that kind of performance. Against a back three he has to stretch the play, run one way and then come short so you don't have to come too far to receive it. He needs to make more space for the midfield players behind him to create chances.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/11a396182a6f34a2cea177cb06aade58", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

You can't do it in twos or threes because you'll get picked off, especially at this level.\"\n\nShearer added: \"You can talk about the energy and the pressure and everything else: their passing still hasn't been good enough either. There's been far too many passes gone astray, simply passes. Don't look at me and say the pitch is bobbly.\"\n\nAs the game drew towards a close, Shearer wrapped up: \"It's been an awful performance, especially after going up in the game ... I'm not sure there's one England player who I can look at and say 'yeah, they've been on it tonight'. They haven't. Caught on the ball, too many sloppy passes, certainly not enough energy.\n\n\"We were looking for an improvement from the first game and it's been worse ... [Southgate] will get asked serious questions and he'll understand that when you look at the players out there.\"\n\nA good bit of alertness from Kyle Walker to beat the much-too-relaxed Victor Kristiansen to an overhit through ball teed up Kane to put Gareth Southgate's side ahead 18 minutes in, with the Bayern Munich striker equalling the England record for most goals at consecutive tournaments in the process.\n\nBut unlike against Serbia in the opening game, England did not get away with inviting pressure on themselves after taking the lead as Morten Hjulmand struck an out-bending effort in off the post from 25 yards.\n\nNonetheless, England are in a strong position to qualify from their group after four points from their first two games ahead of facing Slovenia on Tuesday night.\n\nRanked!

Cristiano Ronaldo is basically the Portugal manager... but why is he celebrating on his own?\n\nThere was a moment 15 minutes from time in England's defeat of Serbia in Gelsenkirchen that could have changed the way their opening game of Euro 2024 has subsequently been viewed.\n\nSubstitute Jarrod Bowen made space on the right and dropped a cross straight on to the head of Harry Kane at the far post. The England captain's contact was clean and powerful only for Serbia goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to touch the ball brilliantly, and rather unexpectedly, on to the underside of the crossbar.\n\nIn that moment Kane was not only denied his 64th international goal, but also the opportunity to stop what appears to be a biennial tournament debate in its tracks.\n\nKane, coming off the back of a prolific season with Bayern Munich, did not score in the group stage of the last World Cup, prompting some chat about his place in Gareth Southgate's team.\n\nIt had been the same in the Euros of 2021, where he did not score until England beat Germany in the round of 16. Now we are in that place again, a place where for some strange reason Kane's role, value and positioning is under scrutiny.\n\nIf Harry Kane scored this chance, it would have changed the way he and England were viewed\n\nThere is a strange biennial debate about his place in the team due to his tournament form\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: It's All Kicking Off at the Euros.

Gary Lineker was under great pressure at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico before he scored a 25-minute first-half hat-trick to almost beat Poland on his own. Alan Shearer was similarly scrutinised ahead of the 1996 and 2000 European Championships. Shearer, as he usually did, responded with goals.\n\nSo too, surely, will Kane, maybe even on Thursday against Denmark in England's second game. He is arguably the most accomplished centre forward in Europe.\n\nRead More How Bukayo Saka became England's Man of Steel\n\nAgainst Serbia, as England lost control of the game in the second half, Kane was dragged deeper and deeper both in search of the ball and often in an effort to add weight and physicality to what had become an unexpectedly dogged defensive effort.\n\nKane often plays in this fashion. He is not a top-of-the-formation striker like, for example, Erling Haaland, or indeed like Shearer and Lineker used to be. He likes to drop in to pick up the ball and use it. He is a superb passer with an excellent range.\n\nIf he is not spending enough time in the opposition penalty area then the chances are something has gone wrong with England's play behind him and this is how it was on Sunday.\n\nKane against Serbia was a symptom of an England problem rather than the cause of it. He touched the ball just 24 times and only twice in the first half. He did not receive a pass from Phil Foden all night and only one from Bukayo Saka.\n\n'He's the skipper and he leads by example,' Kyle Walker, Kane's former Tottenham team-mate, said yesterday. 'Sometimes putting the ball in the back of the net isn't always his job.\n\n'Sometimes you have to do the ugly part of football, which is nine times out of 10 what I'm doing. He's probably seen what I've had to do over the years in defending for your life. It's what you have to do.\n\nKane's performance against Serbia was the symptom of an England problem, not the cause\n\nHe received the ball once from Bukayo Saka all night - and no times from off Phil Foden\n\nKyle Walker insisted that Kane 'leads by example' and that his job isn't just scoring goals\n\n'In tournament football, there's no standout individual. We've had it for years at Manchester City where we don't look at one player and say we lean on them solely for the responsibility of defending or scoring. We're in it as a team. He has done a great job, dug in for the team, which has got us the vital three points we needed to kickstart the tournament.'\n\nThere was something off about England's performance against Serbia, for sure, and Kane's match statistics point to that.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Does England's 'magic potion' work for ordinary people? Mail Sport asks fans to try pickle juice\n\nHis most regular supply -- six passes -- was from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who kicked the ball long more often than any England goalkeeper for quite some time. Second on the list was Jude Bellingham with five passes and that probably reflected how close the two men were standing to each other on occasion.\n\nBellingham himself was a little guilty of trying to do everything on his own on Sunday. Southgate alluded to this yesterday -- albeit it in the gentlest possible way -- by suggesting the emotion of the occasion and his early goal may have spiked the 20-year-old's adrenaline early on.\n\nToo much of England's football was cluttered from that point on and as much as Serbia did not create any clearcut openings, they carried a menace and threat that saw their fancied opponents looking for the whistle to signal full time.\n\nKane will have his say in this tournament, certainly -- he always does -- and that moment will arrive quickly once England unpick some of the tangled strings from Gelsenkirchen. At times it is worth reminding ourselves that they won the game. In England we do seem particularly adept at hand wringing and that does not just come from the media.\n\nFrance beat Austria 1-0 thanks to an own goal. Portugal needed two defensive errors to beat Czech Republic right at the death while Belgium lost 1-0 to Slovakia.\n\nThese are results that should serve to place England's opening effort in proper context, but it was interesting to hear Southgate reveal yesterday that he had gathered his players together to tell them to ignore the din emanating from both mainstream and social media.\n\nKane received the ball most regularly from Jordan Pickford (six times) as England went long\n\nFrance (pictured) and Portugal both managed narrow wins and that should put England's result in context\n\n'He had a brief talk with us on Tuesday night,' said Walker. 'Normally there are 20 Premier League teams to write about and fill columns about. Now all eyes are on us over here representing our country, so obviously there is going to be massive scrutiny on certain performances or certain things we do.\n\n'But we cannot take away that we came away from there with three points on the board, a clean sheet and in good stead for this game against Denmark.'\n\nWalker, 34, is playing in his fourth tournament for Southgate and knows it is always this way.\n\nOnly the 2018 World Cup in Russia represented a free hit because, after the darkness of Euro 2016 and the Sam Allardyce palaver that followed, expectations were so low.\n\nAt the Euros in 2021, in Qatar 18 months later and now here in Germany it has been different and England are once again being reminded that winning is not always enough.\n\n'When we get that scrutiny we have to take it as a positive because people expect so much of us,' reflected Walker.\n\n'We know with the quality we have in the dressing room that we can go and score three or four in games, but in tournament football it is about winning and moving on.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This team is not working and is in danger of stumbling into the knockout stages as easy prey.\n\nGareth Southgate picked a team that took an early lead when Harry Kane benefited from Kyle Walker's smarts in spotting a chance to plunder Denmark's left side. Then England fatally stepped back and conceded the midfield to a Danish side that could scarcely believe their good fortune. Much of the first half was run by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, of all unlikely candidates, and his fellow midfielder Morten Hjulmand, who stroked an equaliser in off the inside of Jordan Pickford's post.\n\nIt would be quicker to say who played well for England, and that was Marc Guehi, the side's best player of the tournament so far, and John Stones, although there were times when England were swaying. Southgate tried to repair midfield by abandoning the Trent Alexander-Arnold experiment on 54 minutes. Conor Gallagher came on then and later the England manager would attempt to re-energise the attack with only marginal improvements.\n\nIt looked like Jude Bellingham had run his race - on an evening in which he had not played at his best. Yet he stayed on and Kane was replaced by Ollie Watkins. Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden, both of whom had moments in the game, the latter hitting a post, also came off. Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze never exerted the influence Southgate had hoped for.\n\nEngland reached the final of Euro 2020 without conceding a goal three years ago. That control is beyond them now. There are changes coming, surely, for the team against Slovenia on Tuesday. It is hard to see Southgate dropping Bellingham, his matchwinning goalscorer against Serbia, although there will come a time when Cole Palmer must have some part in this tournament. It looks unlikely that Alexander-Arnold will start next week either.\n\nThere is often, in the course of a successful tournament, some positions that resolve themselves naturally and a team that changes. But Southgate has not been offered answers in this game. If this is to be his last tournament then there is no time left to wait.\n\nRoy Keane and Ian Wright put Trent Alexander-Arnold under scrutiny:\n\nThey think that Watkins is better suited to the young players' talents. I don't see how you can drop him. It's a tactical thing not an age or talent thing.\n\nAlan Shearer, the BBC pundit and former England captain, did not pull his punches on commentary tonight after accusing England of lacking energy and guile during the match. Here are his best takes:\n\nAs proposed by Rio Ferdinand and Micah Richards: Move Bellingham to No8, drop Alexander-Arnold, switch Foden to0 10 and bring Gordon or Palmer in on the left. Alan Shearer thinks Gordon would be vital, using his pace to help Kane.\n\nEuro 2024 has been a brilliant tournament so far, but England have now played in the two worst games.\n\nEngland top the group by two points but that was an alarming performance. They look well and truly cooked physically and mentally frazzled. The twin English diseases - an inability to think independently on their feet and giving the ball away - are back with a vengeance. Tactically that was garbage, too.\n\nA glimpse of hope when Eze dribbles up the left and works the ball inside but Christensen is there before Bowen and that's that.\n\nEngland fans are booing the ball going backwards. But England have had almost no control for 80 minutes.\n\nThere's going to be three minutes of stoppage time.\n\nPickford will take the free-kick from where Guehi was fouled just inside their half. He rolls it sideways to Walker who lumps it five yards out of play.\n\nFrom 25 minutes in at Gelsenkirchen England have been on an alarming trajectory.\n\nGuehi wins a header in the centre-circle as England finally adopt a higher line.\n\nGuehi teeters between being the architect of England's downfall and their saviour. He loses the ball on the left of England's defence but makes a splendid recover tackle and then England try to shoot themselves in the foot from the corner as first they Christiansen have a dig on goal and then Hojbjerg to have another shot from 20 yards that whistles past the right post with Pickford stranded.\n\nEngland have been terrible. And their shot count compared with Denmark's has been pathetic.\n\nEngland are looking more dangerous for the substitutions but there is still far too much space between Rice/Gallagher and their forwards.\n\nEze loses the ball in tricky position for England's defence for a second time but the lino buys his collapse and waves his flag to signal that he has been fouled even though a replay shows barely any contact.\n\nReferee stops an England break for a perceived foul by Bowen as he challenged for a bouncing ball that stops an England counter. Hojbjerg is fed from the free-kick on halfway and scuds a daisycutter of a shot that Pickford again has to save.\n\nMistake from Eze sends Eriksen away but Gallagher helps his mate out to hold up play sufficiently to get a few numbers back but it takes Pickford to dive headlong and save Hojbjerg's rasping shot. Bowen is fouled by Maehle as he tries to work the parry away.\n\nEngland are trying to inject some urgency but Denmark retreat into a compact 5-3-2 until Bellingham gets on the ball 40 yards out and rolls it down the inside-right and into the box. Watkins has made the run in behind and shoots but Schmeichel races out and starfishes like his old man to block.\n\nDenmark corner after a bizarre error from Rice, slicing it behind. Pickford reads Damsgaard's dipping shot perfectly.\n\nShearer is astutely analysing Kane's shortcomings in this match, saying he hasn't once tried to stretch the defence, citing Bobby Robson's advice when he kept drooping short. 'You have to mix it up.'\n\nDenmark knock a hopeful pass forward that Rice traps on his chest but can't control after it bounces as Eriksen closes him down to tow it away and shoot from 20 yards, sending it swerving over the bar.\n\nYellow card for Gallagher for arriving late and from the side after Christensen had played the ball upfield.\n\nSaka and Foden are attempting to mould the game to their wills and pushing high. Saka this time slaloming through the area on the right and then shooting wide of the far post when the whip didn't bend his shot quickly enough. Seconds later he flies down that wing again and centres ... just behind Kane and in front of Gallagher.\n\nGallagher saves the day for England when Denmark counter, his vigilance in the box nicking the ball away from Hojlund from a scrappy, deflected, right-wing cross. Rice completes the clearance.\n\nFor the third time Foden cuts in from the right on to his left but this time puts his laces through it rather than his instep, beating Schmeichel for pace as the ball crashes into the foot of the right post. Saka follows it in but is forced off the ball as he tries to hook in the rebound.\n\nSouthgate has seen enough from his malfunctioning midfield:\n\nGallagher \u21e2 Alexander-Arnold.\n\nBetter from Saka as he chases a long, bouncing ball into the right of the box and challenges Christensen for a header as Schemichel races out. He beats the former Chelsea defender to the header but plonks it into the side netting from a tight angle as Schmeichel wipes out Christensen.\n\nDenmark slow England down with their defensive positioning and let Rice have a pot shot from 30 yards. It's on target but lacks bite, the sting taken out of it by a deflection.\n\nAt last Alexander-Arnold seizes the initiative and drives 30 yards upfield but his pass is behind Foden and England lose their momentum.\n\nThe vim with which Hojbjerg is snapping into tackle ought to be a lesson for England. Nothing similar from Rice or Alexander-Arnold so far.\n\nThe latter almost opens up his own defence with a left-foot pass that ricochets to safety off Hjulmand. He was trying to force something as he had no obvious targets for a forward pass.\n\nNo changes at half-time. As Shearer says the defence needs to push up and force the other so and so's up the pitch. Maehle catches England out down the right and crosses. Wind traps it, shields it but can't get a shot away and England mop up but not very convincingly.\n\nWant Kane to be substituted and Watkins brought on to stretch the defenders and allow Saka and Foden to press coherently as a front three.\n\nIt has been a frustrating, ragged and alarming first-half from England. As against Serbia they started brightly. As against Serbia, they scored an early goal. As against Serbia they dropped off and lost control. Except it has happened even more quickly against Denmark who deservedly cancelled out Harry Kane's goal with a long-range strike from Victor Kristiansen. Why did it happen? Unfortunately it looks like the experiment of pairing Trent Alexander-Arnold with Declan Rice in the centre of midfield is just not working. Both are dropping too deep and allowing the Danish midfield too much space. England need to get up the pitch and press. It would be no surprise if Alexander-Arnold is replaced by Conor Gallagher at half-time. It is not his fault. He is not a midfielder and, if England manage to win, it would be good to see him used at right-back in the final group game against Slovenia. But we are a long way from being able to say that. Big second-half needed from England.\n\n'They have the players to press but the dilemma is that Harry Kane is so good at scoring by dropping off.'\n\nDenmark are playing well but England have git this tactically wrong. They are far too deep and there is no outlet. Rice was screaming at his forwards to get up the field but when the captain keeps dropping back it seems he takes no notice.\n\nJust the one minute of stoppage time by virtue of Walker being whisked off to change his boots when he sprained his ankle rather than stopping play too long.\n\nFoden has a crack after England switch from right to left and back again. Once again he opens his body and aims for the top left from the inside-right channel and once again he flays it high, wide and hideous.\n\nEngland are far too deep and there's no outlet. Counterintuitively, given the numbers England are getting back, there is space for Denmark to shoot just outside the box and Hojbjerg unleashes, stinging Pickford's palms as he pats it down.\n\nBetter from England as Foden again gets on the ball and just overcooks his lofted diagonal for Saka who had bobbed behind Christensen.\n\nAfter some rapid exchanges of possession in this scrappy game, Foden peels in off the left to shoot, weakly at Schmeichel. Kane wanted the lay-off and lets Foden know.\n\nEvery one of England's front four retreat, forcing the whole side to drop back, ceding space and inviting another shot from Hjulmand which is blocked out for a corner. Eriksen clips the corner long to Andersen beyond the back post and he loops his header on to the roof of the net.\n\nEngland are wobbling here. They look rattled. They need a voice, some leadership to get them back up the pitch.\n\nEngland 1 Denmark 1 (Hjulmand) England nod off and invite the shot. It started with an England throw to Kane who gets an assist for the goal with a hospital crossfield to the Sporting midfielder. He takes a touch or two and since no one closes him down he RSVPs the invitation by rifling it into the bottom right corner, Pickford seeing it late.\n\nGuehi to the rescue again when Wind tries to get a shot off. Both slide on the unstable turf but he makes a vital touch to deflect Wind's effort on to the roof of the net. Minor panic evident in Pickford's footwork as he scrambled backwards to watch it go over.\n\nEngland free-kick 40 yards out and they look for Guehi's run round the back on the right but the ball sails away from his attempt to catch it with right leg extended like Nureyev. His studs scrape it out for a goal-kick.\n\nBack come Denmark and they go down the right. Bellingham tries to shepherd the ball out for a goal-kick but is muscled over and then Eriksen, in those small spaces, uses his control to fashion a pass for Hojlund via a deflection of Pickford. But before the striker can stab it back on goal, Alexander-Arnold bustles in to prod it back to Pickford.\n\nIan Holloway has got himself involved in a fan park down in Brighton and the former Premier League manager's celebration of choice to Harry Kane's opener? A good old traditional fist pump with his pint staying firmly in hand.\n\nDenmark have has their best spell of possession since conceding and send over a deep cross from the right for Wind who is tightly marked by Stones and can only deflect it straight at Pickford rather than use his neck muscles to impart any power.\n\nHojbjerg and Rice are converging at pace and the turf gives way when Hojbjerg tries to stop, making him slip and catch Rice with his studs. Looked filthy out of context but it wasn't his fault and Rice is OK. No Arsenal player would ever want a Spurs player to be sent off ...\n\nDenmark 0-1 England (Kane) Walker blindsides the dawdling Kristiansen on the outside, nicks the ball away and enters the box before looking for the pull-back which he gets wrong. No matter though as it deflects off Christensen and Maehle and sits up invitingly for Kane who steers a left-foot shot from about seven yards past Schmeichel.\n\nShot from Kane with his left after a tenacious high pressing contribution from Rice. Kane pounces on the scraps from Rice's tackle and jinks, looking for an opening that never revealed itself so had to try go through Andersen who made a decent block.\n\nShot from Foden as he ghosts into a central No 10 position. England had worked the ball over from the left through Bellingham and Trippier to Walker who tapped it to his City team-mate. Foden tacked in from inside-right to the edge of the D, opened his body and wrapped a side-foot shot the wrong side of the left post. Rising too.\n\nGuehi makes another fine intervention to stop Hojlund racing through but the flag goes up anyway. The concern, though, is that he also slipped. This pitch looks treacherous.\n\nWalker has rolled his left ankle when the turf gave way beneath him as he planted his foot. He is OK but changes his yellow boots to longer studs. All that rain yesterday has made the grass unstable.\n\nLong ball up to Saka skips off the turf and Schmeichel gobbles it up. But as Alan Shearer says, England's ability to mix it up and use Alexander-Arnold's range of passing adds a different dimension to their attacking play.\n\nKyle Walker has gone down off the ball.\n\nEriksen is sticking pretty much to that pocket between Rice/Alexander-Arnold and the centre-backs. He is attempting to play in the hole and is good enough to make England pay unless someone takes responsibility for him.\n\nWalker slices a pass out for a throw-in, much to the glee of the Denmark fans who serenade him with the traditional 'Aaaaaaaaah' of delighted mockery. From the throw Kristiansen lifts a cross into the box and Guehi heads it powerfully away and then intercepts Hjulmand's attempted pass to Hojlund in the box. My, he reads the game well.\n\nWalker on the overlap flying down the right is sent to the byline by Saka's in to out left-foot pass but he slips as he crosses and can only stab it towards Vestergaard who boots it clear,\n\n'Phil Foden's on fire' is echoing around the Waldstadion.\n\nEngland kick off and move the ball upfield quickly but can't make it stick and Denmark quickly shift it up top for Hojlund running in behind Stones who recovers, forcing the Manchester United striker to lay it off to Hojbjerg who scuffs a tame, low shot straight at Pickford.\n\nAnd switches ends, so England will now attack from left to right. But first a minute's applause for Gerhard Aigner, the former Uefa general secretary, who died today. They're booing that as well.\n\nGod Save the King is lustily sung by players and fans. England fans, of course, boo the start of the Denmark anthem. Stay classy ...\n\nEngland have donned their navy shorts to contrast with Denmark's white as the Dynamite are the designated home team.\n\nIf you like our coverage and would like to receive our football newsletter, please sign up here.\n\nPolice are investigating a complaint that Ivan Toney's father had his watch stolen during the weekend of England's European Championship opener against Serbia.\n\nTelegraph Sport has learnt a criminal investigation has been launched into the alleged theft following the filing of a complaint with Dusseldorf police.\n\nIvan Toney Snr first raised the matter with the Hotel Melia Dusseldorf, where several families of England players had been staying during the country's 1-0 over Serbia in nearby Gelsenkirchen on Sunday night.\n\nToney, who is at his first major international tournament, was an unused substitute during the game.\n\nThe FA declined to comment, while Dusseldorf police said a criminal complaint has been filed and the criminal investigation department is investigating it.\n\nEngland face a Denmark side who they haven't beaten in 90 minutes in their last three encounters. Despite making hard work of Serbia, Southgate's team seem in good spirits and you can get behind them with these Euros free bets.\n\nDenmark (3-4-1-2) Schmeichel (Nice); Vestergaard (Leicester), Christensen (Barcelona), Andersen (Crystal Palace); Maehle (Wolfsburg), Hojbjerg (Spurs), Hjulmand (Sporting Lisbon), Kristiansen (Bologna/Leicester); Eriksen (Man Utd); Hojlund (Man Utd), Wind (Wolfsburg).\n\nEngland (4-2-3-1) Pickford (Everton); Walker (Man City), Stones (Man City), Guehi (Crystal Palace), Trippier (Newcastle); Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Rice (Arsenal); Saka (Arsenal), Bellingham (Real Madrid), Foden (Man City); Kane (Bayern Munich).\n\nReferee Artur Dias (Portugal).\n\nScratch that. In fact, they make one change, Wolfsburg's Joakim Maehle comes in for the right-back Alexander Bah of Benfica:\n\nEngland went 10 minutes early on Sunday and although one might say they went 24 hours early in that Matt Law had the starting XI last night, official confirmation of an unchanged line-up should come through in about five minutes.\n\nAs for Denmark, we're also expecting the same XI, which will be disappointing news for the Brentford trio Mathias Jensen, Mikel Damsgaard and Christian Norgaard who started on the bench for the draw with Slovenia.\n\nSlovenia have taken the lad with 20 minutes to go against Serbia. You can follow the latest action here ...\n\nThe Waldstadion roof will remain closed for this afternoon's match:\n\nIf you would like to read a report of England's victory over Denmark you can do so here and wallow in the glory conveyed by Jason Burt and some blogging drongo...\n\nOdd to reflect how influential Kalvin Phillips, Mason Mount and Raheem Sterling were in that campaign, and Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and Ashley Young were in Russia three years before. And that Marcus Rashford has never been an integral part of an England tournament team and yet has 60 caps, 34 of them off the bench. He is only 26 so has a decent chance of three more sub appearances to match Jermain Defoe's record.\n\nRob Bagchi here, taking over the blog from Kieran. Shall we have a brief pivot to football and the last time these two sides met? Ah yes, I remember it well. It was in the semi-final of Euro 2020 and England were indebted to their player of the tournament, Raheem Sterling, and their captain in extra-time:\n\nThe other game in Group C is taking place in Munich and you can follow our live blog here.\n\nWe have already seen a number of goals from outside the box and we are not even a week into the tournament. Sam Dean and Mike McGrath have been taking a look at why, including balls made from sugar cane.\n\nRasmus Hojlund. After years without a star striker, Denmark (and Manchester United) believe they finally have one in the 21-year-old Dane. He has proved his potential in the Premier League and the stage is set for him to do the same in Germany.\n\nDenmark used nearly every formation in the book throughout qualifying from a 5-3-2 to a 4-3-3 as Hjulmand tweaked his tactical set-up based on their opponent. However, while the formation may change, the style does not with them carrying out a death by a thousand passes plan of attack.\n\nTheir stern defence, quality in midfield and raw attack should see them through the group but the likelihood of meeting Italy or Spain in knockout stages means their hopes of replicating 1992 are slim. Round of 16.\n\nWith 24 teams at Euro 2024, there are 48 kits in total and we have a round-up of the best and worst designs for this summer's tournament.\n\nEngland take on Denmark in Frankfurt this afternoon and we have everything you need to know about not just the Frankfurt Arena but also the other nine venues at Euro 2024.\n\nAfter England's win over Serbia on Sunday night, many England fans had huge travel problems in Gelsenkirchen. Germany's host nation's railway system has been described as being in 'permanent crisis' and our very own Thom Gibbs has spent the day riding trains around Germany, describing it as a 'nightmare'.\n\nA suspected Islamic State sleeper agent has been arrested in Germany just a day after security officials warned of potential terror threats at Euro 2024. Iraqi detainee \"Mahmoud A\" was taken into custody on Wednesday in the town of Esslingen on the outskirts of Stuttgart to be questioned on suspicion of preparing an attack on behalf of the group.\n\nInvestigators say he arrived in Germany in October 2022, despite having been affiliated with the terror group since 2016. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said of the the arrest: \"Our security authorities are extremely vigilant, follow every tip-off and strike hard to protect our country.\"\n\nThomas Haldenwang, head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV), said that the terror threat has surged in recent months amid Arab tensions over Israeli attacks in Gaza. Yesterday's arrest took place hours before Germany played Hungary in their second Euro 2024 match in Stuttgart and a day after Thomas Haldenwang, head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, said that the terror threat has surged following the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nMr Haldenwang said that Germany had become a prime target for extremist groups and that the threat from \"radicalised lone wolves with no clear ties to terrorist organisations\" also posed a significant threat.\n\nLocal media quoted police as saying there was no concrete plan for an attack. They said the man supported the Islamic State since 2016 and he came to Germany in 2022.\n\nHe is said to have been \"fundamentally prepared to carry out an attack for the terrorist group IS\" but did not have a plan or \"a specific goal.\" The arrest was not linked to any planned attack on the Euros.\n\nNews has broken this morning that Serbia, who are in Group C alongside England, have threatened to quit Euro 2024 hours before their game against Slovenia after accusing Croatia and Albania fans of chanting \"Kill, kill, kill the Serb\" yesterday. Ben Rumsby has all the latest as the Head of the Serbian FA has said they will refuse to remain in the tournament unless the Croatian and Albanian FAs are punished.\n\nIn the aftermath of England's victory over Serbia, some people have been asking if Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden can play in the same team. Chris Bascombe has been taking a closer look at Gareth Southgate's options to get the best out of both of them.\n\nDo you think you can predict every group-stage game and who will go all the way and win Euro 2024? Well, here is your chance with our Euro predictor.\n\nYou can keep up-to-date with all games, the group stage standings and the knockout stages with our dedicated fixtures, results and groups page so that you do not miss a beat.\n\nPhil Foden is expected to keep his place in the England team today against Denmark, but his performance against Serbia drew criticism. The freshly crowned Football of the Year scored 19 Premier League goals and registered eight assists, yet was a peripheral figure against Serbia. Daniel Zeqiri looks into why the Manchester City version of Foden is not seen for England.\n\nWho is Denmark's star player? How do Albania set up? Who is in the Portugal squad? We have you covered with our team-by-team guide to help you with everything you need to know about every single one of the 24 teams at Euro 2024.\n\nHistorically it has been well-documented how in England camp in years gone by how club rivalries were difficult to shake. However, it is all-change now with a lot of strong bonds being formed. These friendships are a far cry from the 'pretend relationships' of the past, as Matt Law explains.\n\nMatch shirts worn by players at the European Championship are being auctioned online within days of each game, Telegraph Sport can reveal. Signed tops donned by some of football's biggest stars at its second biggest tournament are attracting bids worth thousands of pounds on the website of MatchWornShirt.\n\nThe company appears to have access to shirts worn by, or \"issued\" to, players from almost half the teams at Euro 2024, including Scotland. One worn by John McGinn from their opening 5-1 defeat to Germany fetched almost \u00a32,000 upon being auctioned, while one donned by Luka Modric in Croatia's 3-0 loss to Spain went for more than \u00a36,200.\n\nThose numbers are set to be dwarfed by a top that was not even worn by Toni Kroos in what is his final tournament for Germany. With three days of the auction remaining, a shirt \"issued\" to, and signed by, him for the Scotland game had attracted a bid in excess of \u00a38,600.\n\nAmsterdam-based MatchWornShirts has entered into partnerships with a series of club and national teams to auction off shirts and other match memorabilia. They do not currently include England but the Football Association refused to rule out a tie-up in future.\n\nMatchWornShirt has been approached for comment.\n\nIn the aftermath of England's win over Serbia in their opening match of the tournament, Phil Foden's performance was criticised and people have asked whether he can play in the same starting XI as Jude Bellingham, who scored England's winning goal against Serbia. The Manchester City man has responded, insisting he can play alongside Bellingham.\n\nAround 2,000 England fans were in the main city square in Frankfurt last night (June 19) and no major issues were reported. This is indicative of what we have seen across Germany so far, with the vast majority of England fans behaving extremely well. Three England fans were arrested by German Police (one for bottle throwing, one for abusing a UK police officer and one for throwing a missile at police and being in possession of drugs).\n\nThere is a distinct possibility that today's match will be played under a closed roof. Thunderstorms and torrential rain are forecast and Uefa will decide today whether to close the roof or keep it open. Mike McGrath has the very latest from Frankfurt.\n\nGareth Southgate is attempting to turn outsiders' negativity about the England team's performance and players' bewilderment at criticism into a motivational spark. Jason Burt and Mike McGrath have taken a look at Southgate's role as a 'psychologist' for England.\n\nIt is expected that Gareth Southgate will stick with the same starting XI in Frankfurt this afternoon against Denmark that started the 1-0 win over Serbia in their opening game on Sunday. Matt Law has the very latest from the England camp.\n\nEnglish fans were serenaded with Hey Jude and given free beers on the streets of Frankfurt as they met the world's friendliest fans. Serving up the cheapest pints in Germany, Denmark fans marked their arrival with England anthems as they descended on R\u00f6merberg Square ahead of the clash with the Three Lions.\n\nFirst there was the Goldschmidt family band of two twin brothers and their father from Copenhagen who carrying a guitar, giant tuba and accordion approached a bar shyly, before serenading initially confused fans with Hey Jude. Then there was the red and white Volvo bus that arrived in Frankfurt's historic market square that began blasting out Three Lions on loudspeakers before several Danes hoisted the St George's Cross up a flagpole.\n\nCalled the Roliganbussen, a 30-year-old Volvo B10M that's been refitted with five berths, several tables and a bar. The name of the bus comes after the word Rolig which translates as quiet or calm.\n\n\"It started back when there was all this hooliganism and fighting. Danes started doing the opposite: Rooligans. Rooli means cheerful, or calm in Danish,\" Erik Bro, 55, a consultant from Aarhus, Denmark's second largest city, said. \"The main thing is making a good mood between the English and the Danish.\"\n\nPacked with 15 kegs of Danish beer, the bus was the idea of a group of friends if they made it to the Euros. Within 15 minutes of the team qualifying they had found a bus which now has a rooftop garden, complete with hammock, which has space for between 30 and 50 people who are welcomed wherever Denmark go.\n\n\"Whenever we are out on the bus our opponent's flag will also be on our bus as well,\" Mr Bro added. \"We invite opponents in for a beer. The rule is that if a Dane comes with an English fan under his arm, then they will both have a free pint.\"\n\nAs he offered The Telegraph a pint of Carlsberg on board, he added: \"We are probably the friendliest fans in the world.\"\n\nNow the Danish King Frederik X has been invited to join them and as the bus toured around Frankfurt the fans said they would love to have Prince William join them when he watches the England game.\n\nThe Danes added that \"many\" England fans had enjoyed their hospitality and as the latest round of their thirsty opponents made their way off the bus, he asked if they were sure they wanted to leave. \"Just a half more?,\" Mr Bro asked before discovering the keg had run dry.\n\nBosses have been warned to expect millions of employees to work from home or call in sick today to watch England take on Denmark in the Euros. HR chiefs are predicting what has been dubbed \"Slope-off Thursday\", with the 5pm kick-off prompting many football fans to avoid going into the office or take annual leave.\n\nSome 14 million more of the nation's workforce are predicted to work from home and a further three million have already decided to take the day off as a holiday, according to BrightHR, which monitors absence among more than a million employees across more than 50,000 UK companies. Holiday rates are up 123 per cent for Thursday and 148 per cent for the following day, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, a third of England's workforce are expected to clock off early to make it to the pub in time for kick-off, or watch from their desks on company time, costing the economy a predicted \u00a3208 million based on Office of National Statistics (ONS) daily productivity data trends.\n\nAlan Price, the chief executive of BrightHR, told the Telegraph: \"With the match kicking off at 5pm, it looks like 'Slope-off Thursday' with staff ducking out early to get to the pub in time.\n\n\"Some will claim they've fallen sick during the day so they can watch the game, many more will work from home so they don't miss it, and holiday requests are up sharply as well. Productivity will also take a nosedive among staff stuck at work and following the match.\n\n\"The game will cost the economy big time. Just one hour's lost work across millions of employees costs well into the millions. The best advice for bosses to keep staff on side is to let them watch the game at work and make up lost working time later.\"\n\nAs supporters pack into pubs on Thursday evening, the hospitality industry is expecting a significant boost in sales, with the BBPA estimating an extra five million pints to be sunk by Britons - worth an extra \u00a324 million in sales for businesses.\n\n\"The Euros are already providing a huge uplift in extra trade for pubs as football fans know that there is no better place to watch live than down their local,\" Emma McClarkin, the Chief Executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said.\n\n\"For this England v Denmark the latest BBPA figure show that between four to five million extra pints will be enjoyed worth up to a potential \u00a324 million for the sector.\"\n\nTV viewing records are also set to be broken on Thursday, with 15 million BBC viewers, the biggest tea-time TV ratings of the year, expected across BBC One and iPlayer, analysis of previous tournaments' England audiences shows.\n\n\"England daytime games have surprisingly high ratings. People will make the effort to watch, taking time off work, and kids will make sure they are home from school in time,\" TV ratings provider Overnights.tv said.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com",

The result kept it top of the group on four points, but means there is still work to do when it faces Slovenia in Cologne on Tuesday.\n\nThat was because Denmark responded quickly and effectively, as Gareth Southgate's side went into its shell in the period that followed Kane's opener.\n\nMorten Hjulmand was responsible for pulling his team level, unleashing a superb shot from outside the area on 34 minutes, rattling it past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford off the inside of the post.\n\nThe outcome will only raise further questions about Southgate's approach, as the creative duo of Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham again failed to connect with any kind of fluidity.\n\nThe experiment of playing Trent Alexander-Arnold out of position in a central midfield role may have now been abandoned. Alexander-Arnold was removed early in the second half, with Conor Gallagher brought on the replace him.\n\nSoon after, Foden hit the post, a left-foot effort from the edge of the area reminiscent of several of his strikes for Manchester City in the past season. This time, however, despite beating Kasper Schmeichel, he was inches away from the desired result.\n\n[Related: Euro 2024 highlights: England draws 1-1 with underdog Denmark]\n\nIn broad terms, England's position is far from a disaster. There are some similarities to its World Cup group in 2022, where an opening victory was followed by a draw - against the United States - and kept its fate in its own hands.\n\nYet more was expected from one of the most-fancied teams pre-tournament, especially the combination of Bellingham and Foden, the respective La Liga and English Premier League players of the season.\n\nSouthgate had named an unchanged team from the shaky victory over Serbia, but made a flurry of substitutions midway through the second period, essentially replacing his entire frontline.\n\nFoden made way for Jarrod Bowen, Bukayo Saka was switched out for Eberechi Eze, and, in the most surprising move of all, captain Kane was taken off for the incoming Ollie Watkins.\n\nWatkins soon got into the action, running on to a through ball from Bellingham, but his angled shot was well blocked by Schmeichel.\n\nDenmark grew in confidence and had chances of its own, with Rasmus Hojlund and Piere-Emile Hojbjerg both threatening.\n\nAfter Hojlund was replaced by Yussuf Poulsen, Mikkel Damsgaard, scorer against England in the Euro 2020 semi at Wembley, smacked a long -ange effort that Jordan Pickford had to move quickly to parry.\n\nHojberg provided another blast that caused Pickford some trouble, the bounce unpredictable on a poor surface that regularly chopped up over the course of the evening.\n\nMidfielder Christian Eriksen tied his country's all-time record by making his 132nd international appearance, as Denmark kept its hopes alive, and could still win the group if it beats Serbia on Tuesday.\n\nAs the game wound down Declan Rice capped a disappointing game by giving the ball away, with defender Marc Guehi forced into a desperation tackle to avert more danger.\n\nThe reaction from England's public and press is unlikely to be positive. Southgate, and his team, have work to do.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England",

Harry Kane had opened the scoring, but the former Tottenham Hotspur star's goal was cancelled out by a strike from Denmark's Morten Hjulmand.\n\nEngland now have just one final group game in the tournament which comes against Slovenia next Tuesday. Qualification for the last-16 is almost secured, but concerns emerged around the tactics employed by Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate.\n\nShearer was critical of the tactics used by England during the draw with Denmark. The former striker used Rice's role in the Arsenal team under Mikel Arteta as a comparison to the midfielder's impact for England so far at Euro 2024.\n\n\"Let's use John Stones as an example,\" Shearer told BBC Sport during his post-match analysis. \"How many times do you see him get the ball and run into midfield, or get the ball with his back and turn in the Man City team? So many times. He's brilliant at it.\n\n\"How many times have you seen him do it in the last two England games? I can't remember any.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal transfer delay explained as Mikel Arteta has already told supporters what to expect\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal powerhouse behind \u00a3600m deal tipped for new job after double departure and promotion\n\n\"How many times do you see Declan Rice getting that ball and bursting forward? How many times have you seen him do it in an England shirt in the last two games? None.\n\n\"How many times do you see Phil Foden get on the ball in the middle of the park, turn? Maybe once tonight when he had the shot and hit the post. So Gareth at the minute is not getting the best out of England's best players.\"\n\nShearer was also displeased with the general performance of England in the draw with Denmark. The former Newcastle striker went on to explain why he believes there will be concerns going forward for Southgate and Co.\n\n\"It was very poor, it wasn't good enough,\" said Shearer.\n\n\"We've all been there as players, and yes you do try and take the positives, and yes it is tournament football. But it's our job and the coaches' jobs to dissect what went wrong, and there's plenty to look at there.\n\n\"Where do you start? No energy, no guile, I wouldn't say a lack of effort or not trying, but there's so much more to come from those players.\n\n\"I look at Jude [Bellinghaam] tonight, he couldn't put one foot in front of the other. He couldn't get forward.\n\n\"I look at Phil Foden on the left - is he affecting the game? No chance. I look at [Bukayo] Saka and Harry Kane, I know he [Kane] got his goal and I mentioned it on commentary about running in behind. At least when [Ollie] Watkins came on the defenders were running in behind. It was really poor and it is concerning, absolutely.\"", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_wakefield@football.london", "name": "Mark Wakefield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Slovenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Slovenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29393934.ece/alternates/s1200/0_shearerjpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The two group rivals, England and Denmark, are set to face off on Thursday at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt, with the match starting at 6 p.m. local time (16:00 GMT).\n\nDenmark is in dire need of a win, particularly considering their final Group C game against Serbia will be a tough challenge.This encounter brings back memories of their Euro 2020 semifinal, where England triumphed 2-1 in extra time after Harry Kane scored from a rebound off his saved penalty. Despite still being upset about the penalty decision, Denmark's coach Kasper Hjulmand is concentrating on the upcoming match.\n\nBoth teams have players who are teammates at Manchester United, Crystal Palace, and Brentford, making the squads well-acquainted with each other. Gareth Southgate, England's coach, is in his fourth tournament and is less worried about the style of the win against Serbia, having previously navigated England through group stages with ease.\n\nSouthgate is considering keeping Trent Alexander-Arnold in central midfield and must make decisions on options such as debutants Kobbie Mainoo and Adam Wharton. With left-back Luke Shaw still unavailable, Kieran Trippier may continue to play on the left side.\n\nDenmark has no reported injuries, and captain Simon Kjaer is ready to return to the line up. A draw might be enough for Denmark to stay in contention for a spot in the knockout stage, while another victory for England could see them finish at the top of the group and face a third-place team in the round of 16.\n\nIt's worth noting that England has never won their first two games in a Euros tournament, and Denmark's Kjaer, who did not play against Slovenia, now has 132 caps, just one more than Christian Eriksen, who scored in the 1-1 draw.\n\nEngland vs Denmark match details\n\nWhen will England vs Denmark start?\n\nThe UEFA European Championship 2024 Group C match between England vs Denmark is set for June 20, Thursday.\n\nWhen and where to watch England vs Denmark in India?\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2024 match is scheduled to kick off at 9:30 PM IST on Thursday at Frankfurt in Germany.

They're not playing particularly well so they need to sort themselves out.\n\nSouthgate watched as his side stumbled to a 1-1 draw with Denmark on Thursday evening\n\nEngland deserve praise for being top of Group C but have struggled to convince with their performances\n\nHarry Kane put England ahead but was later taken off and criticised for a lack of pressing\n\nRio Ferdinand said he would have been 'screaming' at Kane at half-time for not having the same 'workload' as others\n\n'Something needs to change here. This ends badly the way it is going.'\n\nThe problem of how to fuse a front four of Harry Kane, Foden, Bukayo Saka, and Foden, as well as the question of how much to include stars such as Cole Palmer, has been one of England's talking points before and during Euro 2024.\n\nPundits felt that Foden improved coming into a more central role against Denmark, but criticised Kane for dropping too deep and not pressing with enough verve.\n\nAt half-time against Denmark, Rio Ferdinand told BBC Sport: 'I'd be going mad [at Kane]. I'd be screaming. I couldn't have my centre-forward not filling in with the same workload that the other players are putting in.\n\n'I need to see the same workload and intensity [from Kane]. Put their centre-half under pressure like I'm receiving as an England defender!'\n\nMicah Richards even called for him to be replaced by Ollie Watkins, which he was after 70 minutes, a decisive move for which Southgate was praised.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/21/86387115-0-image-m-17_1718914826629.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Harry Kane converted the rebound after Kasper Schmeichel saved the striker's spot-kick and Denmark were left to rage at Sterling making the most of minimal contact from Joakim M\u00e6hle.\n\n\"In Denmark, they will definitely remember that semi-final,\" Frank told the BBC. \"And the penalty.

It's definitely not going to be taken lightly.\"\n\nKasper Hjulmand, Denmark's manager, said after the game it was \"a penalty which should not have been a penalty\", and he remains aggrieved about that Wembley semi-final. He watched Denmark take the lead through Mikkel Damsgaard's free-kick, only for England to fight back and reach the final.\n\n\"I still wake up at night thinking about that match,\" Hjulmand said last December. \"Obviously, when you are that close, I think it is something you will always remember and will always carry with you when you are that close to a final.

The England captain managed only one touch in the box during the game, with that touch leading to his goal. Lack of pressing by Kane led Lineker to suggest that Gareth Southgate should demand more from him.\n\nGary Lineker has torn into Harry Kane after the England captain was hauled off during the Three Lions' disappointing 1-1 draw against Denmark.\n\nKane opened his tournament account with a well taken finish in the opening 15 minutes, but the Bayern Munich man faded into obscurity as the game went on, eventually being replaced by Aston Villa front man Ollie Watkins when England were in need of a goal.\n\nNow, Lineker, who won the golden boot at the 1986 World Cup, has launched a scathing criticism of the country's record goalscorer, labeling his performance as lethargic and suggesting that England manager Gareth Southgate must demand more from him.\n\nRelated 3 Things Gareth Southgate Got Wrong During Denmark 1-1 England\n\nEngland no longer look like Euro 2024 favourites after another dismal performance against Denmark - and Southgate has questions to answer.\n\nLineker Fumes At Kane's Lack Of Effort The BBC claimed that the number nine didn't press the Denmark backline enough\n\nSpeaking at half-time, Lineker first raised concerns about Kane's lack of defensive output whilst leading the line, stating that he didn't understand why the skipper was dropping off so deep. As per The Mirror, the 63-year-old stated:\n\n\"Can I offer a slight theory? If you want to press, it has to come from your centre forward first.\n\n\"Harry does not press and he has not pressed in that first half. He's barely moved. Then the team goes deeper and Harry Kane goes even deeper and even when you get the ball you have nothing to hit. I just don't understand.\"\n\nTottenham's greatest marksman continued to look non-existent throughout the latter 45 minutes, prompting Lineker to make his feelings clear after the final whistle.\n\n\"In all honesty, I think Harry Kane needs to do a lot better. His movement was minimal. He didn't look to go behind and he doesn't often. Even when he's dropping short, he's doing so very lethargically.\n\n\"When you're a striker, your two jobs are to score goals, which he's brilliant at. But, I think he needs his manager to say I need a little bit more from you, Harry.\n\n\"He's up against three at the back. He has got to stretch that team. Even if he's dropping short. You don't have to go 20 yards to get it. He's not creating the space for himself.\n\n\"If you've got someone going in behind you can stretch the team and that creates more space for the midfield players behind you. If you are playing fairly deep anyway, and your striker comes deep, it exacerbates the issue because then you've got no target to hit at all. He's got to stay high and that gives England a chance to get out and get people around him.\"\n\nFormer England international Rio Ferdinand agreed with his co-host, adding that the striker lacked any variability, making it easier for defenders to predict his next steps.\n\nHarry Kane Touch Map England's main man managed just one touch in the box all game\n\nKane's difficulties against Denmark were summed up by a touch map that Micah Richards showed BBC viewers at the end of the game. It shows that across the entirety of the 30-year-old's performance, he had just a singular touch inside the penalty area, that touch being the most important of the game as it was the one that gave England the lead.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Kane's goal against Denmark saw him move to third in England's all-time European Championship goalscorers, behind Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen.\n\nIn total, Kane took just 21 touches of the ball, nine of which were inside his own half. In comparison, only a further two were within the general vicinity of the 18-yard-box.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-20-jun-2024-07-26-pm-1599.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

With the Denmark game looming on Thursday (5pm), Brown believes Southgate must switch up his game plan and allow Kane to be England's linchpin.\n\nREAD MORE: England fans have a point - Alexander-Arnold shouldn't get special 'Trent' treatment\n\nREAD MORE: Ice-cold Kobbie Mainoo eyeing England dream at Euro 2024 after Wayne Rooney comments\n\nSpeaking on Reach's new Euro Thrash podcast - which you can find on YouTube, Apple and Spotify - Brown said: \"He's the main guy, but he needs more of the ball, more service. Because Jude [Bellingham] is right behind him, likes to get on the ball wherever, so that doesn't help Harry Kane with his touches and his lead-up play.\n\n\"It would be good if he could get more touches, bring more people into play and ultimately Harry [Kane] is there in the end as a six-yard man, getting into that space. That is where you want him.\n\n\"He is not the one who is going to turn defenders and sprint onto the ball, that is not his game. He's getting the ball when we are moving up slowly and when we do get an opportunity, he will be in the right space.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United legend Brown has dished out some tactical insight on Harry Kane's role in the England squad, noting that while Kane isn't the type to blaze past defenders, he's a master at finding the right spot when the team advances gradually. Despite his strategic play, Kane was denied a goal by Serbia's keeper Predrag Rajkovic's stunning save.\n\nKane was tasked with the unfamiliar job of busying defenders and helping the midfield thrive against Serbia but it still took a stunning save to keep him from doubling England's lead. Dishing out some tactical insight, Manchester United legend Brown believes that Southgate should not fall into the trap of relying too heavily on his midfield stars at Kane's expense.\n\n\"You want him in the box. We need someone there to occupy the last two defenders so we can create some space around and I do think he does that well,\" Brown added.\n\n\"Kane will be looking at it when we've got the ball in possession, he'll know these lads are capable of creating and making things happen, and if one of the opposition messes up, I'll be in that little bit of space to get a shot off and try and score.\"\n\n\"He will be looking and thinking 'I want to be in that game, I want to be the guy, I want to be the star who scores', but teams do make it difficult for you these days.\"\n\nWith a victory over Denmark, who previously tied with Slovenia, England is poised to secure their spot in the knockout stages. This upcoming clash marks the first encounter since England's tight win against Denmark in the Euro 2020 semi-finals.\n\nWatch and listen to Euro Thrash on YouTube, Apple Podcasts and Spotify with regular new episodes throughout Euro 2024.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_bayliss@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Jake Bayliss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Brown_(footballer,_born_June_1985)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Brown (footballer, born June 1985)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wes Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33065220.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2157301019.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nEngland struggled in their second match at Euro 2024, escaping with a point after a 1-1 draw against an impressive Denmark on Thursday night.\n\nHarry Kane opened his Euro 2024 account in the 18 minute before Denmark equalised through Morten Hjulmand's long-range strike as the Danes came back strong at the end of the first-half.\n\nDenmark had the better of the chances in the second-half as England wilted late on, but ultimately it was a point apiece in Frankfurt.\n\nEngland face Slovenia in their final Group C clash on Tuesday night, while Denmark take on Serbia.\n\nBut how did each player perform? Here are The Independent's player ratings:\n\nJordan Pickford - 6\n\nConceded his first goal of the tournament through Morten Hjulmand's long-range shot but can't really be blamed for a pinpoint strike. Otherwise assured and made the saves required.\n\nKyle Walker - 8\n\nEngland's best player on the day. Sat on his haunches early on as his foot gave way to the terrible turf underneath in Frankfurt, but that didn't defy him as he caught Victor Kristiansen off-guard and via a deflection found Harry Kane for the first goal. Continued to be a consistent source on the front-foot until the end.\n\nJohn Stones - 6\n\nA slightly tetchier performance than Sunday from the Man City defender but he, largely, kept Rasmus Hojlund quiet throughout.\n\nMarc Guehi - 6\n\nAnother largely assured performance from the Crystal Palace captain, until the end when he lost possession cheaply - but recovered well to deny Alexander Tah a shot at goal.\n\nKieran Trippier - 6\n\nA typically solid performance, though England miss a quick, surging outlet down the left-hand side in a similar vein to Walker on the right. But for what Trippier offers, he remains an adequate stand-in for Luke Shaw.\n\nDeclan Rice - 5\n\nA misplaced pass to Guehi which went out for a corner rather summed up the midfielder's afternoon. There's little alternative in his position, and covered plenty of ground as usual, but gave the ball away cheaply at times.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - 5\n\nTwo games in, the TAA midfield experiment has not worked. A few heavy touches early on and next to nothing in terms of creativity with his wonderful long-range skillset. Hooked just after half-time, it'd be a surprise if he started against Slovenia.\n\nBukayo Saka - 6\n\nShowed flashes, but it was more neat and tidy from the Arsenal winger as opposed to the end product of the first match. Notable, too, that he was substituted on 70 minutes.\n\nJude Bellingham - 6\n\nGiven his talismanic performance against Serbia, a strangely uninfluential day for England's No 10 in Frankfurt. Kept looking for the ball until the end and set up Watkins well late on, but a day of frustration for Bellingham.\n\nPhil Foden - 6\n\nLivelier than his anonymous opening game performance. Lovely footwork carved out a chance single-handedly early on but the Premier League player of the season skewed his shot wide. Similarly danced through the Danish midfield just before half-time but shot weakly, when he should have played in Kane, and hit the post in the second-half. Better.\n\nHarry Kane - 7\n\nOff the mark at Euro 2024 with a typical cool finish from the break of the ball in the box, goal No 64 for the Three Lions, but did give the ball away very cheaply in his own half, with Denmark equalising seconds later.\n\nBooked soon after coming on for a rash challenge and didn't seem up to speed at times.\n\nOllie Watkins - 7\n\nBrilliant run in behind early on; pace which may well be utilised more going forward.\n\nA tad more involved than Eze, but didn't quite have the time to link-up effectively with Walker down the right.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Performance_and_Capacity", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Performance and Capacity", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/20/18/GettyImages-2158451627.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

And to add insult to injury, Kasper Schmeichel - Peter's son - saved Harry Kane's 104th-minute effort, only for the forward to tap in the rebound.\n\n'It's what football is.' Schmeichel, who spoke to Mail Sport while promoting Frank's Redhot sauce, said. 'It's tough. Decisions go against you, decisions go with you. Sometimes you benefit from it, sometimes you don't and that's it.'\n\nThe sides meet on Thursday for the first time since that encounter, each coming off largely uninspiring performances in their tournament openers.\n\nRead More Jude Bellingham plays like he's unbeatable but others must step up, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nGareth Southgate's side were at least able to eke out a 1-0 victory, which saw them ascend to the top of an increasingly competitive Group C.\n\nEarlier in the day, more than 450 km away, Kasper Hjulmand watched as his team stuttered and stumbled before eventually hanging on for a draw against Slovenia, when defeat would have been just reward for their display.\n\nIt will be abundantly clear to the Danes that a similar showing against England could see their campaign resemble their disappointing Qatar World Cup, where they finished bottom of a group including France, Australia and Tunisia - not the valiant Euros run 18 months earlier many had predicted.\n\nTempting as it may be to presume the Danish camp has been thirsting for revenge or that Hjulmand has plastered stills of Sterling's Wembley tumble on every wall, Schmeichel plead the contrary.\n\nIn his view, a game against the Three Lions is big enough. Especially given the predicament Denmark now find themselves in.\n\nDenmark head coach Kasper Hjulmand is preparing his side for the clash against England in Frankfurt\n\nHis side struggled in their Euro 2024 opener against Slovenia which ended in a 1-1 draw\n\nChristian Eriksen enjoyed a starring role and scored a superb goal to give the Danes a first-half lead\n\n'There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that revenge will never come up as a word when the team is preparing for the game.' Schmeichel, who improbably lifted the Henri Delaunay trophy with Denmark in 1992, said.\n\nRead More Thomas Frank warns England that Denmark will be fuelled by injustice from defeat at Euro 2020\n\n'Anytime in the history of football you play England, it's a special game. It doesn't matter how good or how bad England are. It's a big game and from the outset you have to play to your best level to be able to compete.\n\n'As a manager or player you don't want to bring all of these external things that don't have anything to do with the now into the equation.'\n\nOne positive from Denmark's opener was the performance of Christian Eriksen. Almost three years to the day since he suffered a cardiac arrest and shockingly collapsed on the pitch against Finland, his starring role against Slovenia felt particularly poignant.\n\nThe 32-year-old is one of a number of Danish starters that will be extremely familiar to Premier League viewers.\n\nUnited colleague Rasmus Hojlund leads the line, while Pierre Emerick Hojbjerg, Jannik Vestergaard, Andreas Christensen, Joachim Andersen and Kasper Schmeichel have all enjoyed success in the English top-flight.\n\nIn Stuttgart, the former Tottenham star played with a swagger and command that belied his form for the Red Devils. Hummel chevrons on his shoulders and Eriksen is a man reborn.\n\nSchmeichel believes the midfielder is on a mission to truly stamp his authority on this tournament and he is adamant that the 'traumatic' event at the Parken Stadium will have no bearing on Eriksen or his team-mates this time around.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Frank's RedHot UK (@franksredhot_uk)\n\nEngland currently sit top of the group after grinding out a 1-0 win over Serbia last Sunday\n\n'You can see how happy he is and how much he's enjoying being with this squad,' Schmeichel added. 'I'm convinced that he is going to have a really strong Euros.\n\n'He's talking about it himself, about how often it's been his Euros and then it hasn't been. He's such an important player for us.'\n\nWith England sat top of the group on three points, Denmark will need to force the issue in Frankfurt.\n\nOne would imagine Southgate would delight in extending England's run of group stage clean sheets and the four points that would all but secure a knockout berth, if offered a goalless draw pre-match.\n\nThat makes a clash potentially a defining game for the Danish manager and his outfit. Several starters are the wrong side of 30, while their young stars still need time to mature.\n\nAdditionally, Hjulmand has come under fire in recent months, most intensely after deciding to snub Celtic's Matt O'Riley from his Euros squad, despite the 23-year-old's impressive season at Parkhead.\n\nDefeat against England would leave Denmark needing a win in their final Group C fixture for a chance to progress\n\nSchmeichel, though, remains confident in this Denmark side and their ability to go far this summer. Pushed for his prediction, he backed his nation to prevail by two unanswered goals.\n\n'We've got really good, strong players and we've got some young players coming through. 'He added. 'We are very positive, Denmark has been looking forward to this Euros for so long, like I can't remember.'\n\nFrank's is bringing an essence of Germany to London on Thursday 20th June, as it takes

With a total of 24 touches by the end of the game, the ex-Tottenham Hotspur striker opted not to drop deep in search of possession.\n\nJude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka played vital attacking roles for the Three Lions, but Kane's minimal involvement could be an early sign that Southgate needs to alter his tactics. As England prepare to face Denmark on Thursday (5pm), Manchester United legend Wes Brown has urged his ex-England teammate Southgate to allow Kane to take centre stage.\n\nSpeaking on Reach's new Euro Thrash podcast - which you can find on YouTube, Apple and Spotify - Brown said: \"He's the main guy, but he needs more of the ball, more service. Because Jude [Bellingham] is right behind him, likes to get on the ball wherever, so that doesn't help Harry Kane with his touches and his lead-up play.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Bang in trouble' - Rio Ferdinand issues radical Bukayo Saka demand for England\n\nREAD MORE: BBC releases statement after Gary Lineker appears to break rules during Euro 2024 coverage\n\n\"It would be good if he could get more touches, bring more people into play and ultimately Harry [Kane] is there in the end as a six-yard man, getting into that space. That is where you want him.\n\n\"He is not the one who is going to turn defenders and sprint onto the ball, that is not his game. He's getting the ball when we are moving up slowly and when we do get an opportunity, he will be in the right space.\"\n\nDespite Kane being occupied with keeping Serbia's back three busy and creating room for England's creative midfielders, only a stunning save from Predrag Rajkovic stopped him from adding his name to the scoresheet with a second-half header. Brown recognises Kane's strength as a lone striker but believes a minor adjustment could unleash England's all-time top scorer.\n\n\"You want him in the box. We need someone there to occupy the last two defenders so we can create some space around and I do think he does that well,\" Brown added.\n\n\"Kane will be looking at it when we've got the ball in possession, he'll know these lads are capable of creating and making things happen, and if one of the opposition messes up, I'll be in that little bit of space to get a shot off and try and score.\"\n\n\"He will be looking and thinking 'I want to be in that game, I want to be the guy, I want to be the star who scores', but teams do make it difficult for you these days.\"\n\nEngland have the chance to secure their spot in the knockout stages with a victory over Denmark, who started their campaign with a draw against Slovenia. This will be the first encounter between the two sides since the Three Lions' narrow semi-final win at Euro 2020.\n\nWatch and listen to Euro Thrash on YouTube, Apple Podcasts and Spotify with regular new episodes throughout Euro 2024.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_bayliss@football.london", "name": "Jake Bayliss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wes Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/premier-league/article29384014.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harry-kane-playing-for-england.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

supporters as teams draw at Euro 2024 match", "body": "In an event which has been more entertaining than basically everything which occurred during England's 1-1 draw with Denmark at Euro 2024, the Danish fans decided to deploy a rather NSFW chant ahead of the game.\n\nIf you've just been watching the Three Lions put on a display about as scintillating as a dentist appointment then you might appreciate some levity.\n\nEngland went ahead first thanks to an early Harry Kane goal, but almost immediately sat deep and invited pressure.\n\nA misplaced pass from Kane set up Morten Hjulmand to put the ball past Pickford from distance, and from there things were distinctly unexciting as England didn't craft many more exciting chances.\n\nPhil Foden and Jude Bellingham both appeared to be trying to play in the same spot, Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield doesn't seem to be working and beyond the goals the most exciting moment was when Gareth Southgate decided to switch out his entire forward line.\n\nYep, that's the level of entertainment we got that we're discussing a triple substitution being a moment of excitement.\n\nAnyhow, only what the Danish fans were up to that was so noteworthy.\n\nBefore the game, back in that realm when anything was possible and England vs Denmark might have been a scintillating spectacle instead of the match we actually got, Danish fans had their chants ready.\n\nThey were inviting English supporters to 'stick your f**king teabag up your a**e', and frankly if you spent the past 90 minutes doing that then you probably had a better time than if you'd watched the game.\n\nStill, some England fans said the teabag chant was 'bang out of order', while others said it was 'too far' from the Danes.\n\nSuch clap-backs from England fans might have held weight before the game, but after the Three Lions served up a level of fun you'd expect from a seminar at a data entry company there's really not a lot of ammunition to strike back.\n\nFor some reason England were named the bookies favourites to win Euro 2024, but with performances like that it's definitely not happening and they'll be rolled over the first time they end up on a pitch with one of the other big boys of Europe.\n\nSorry to be so negative, dear reader, but I just sat through 90 minutes of relative drudgery where England seem to be making the mistakes we so often make at international tournaments and I'm not having a fun time.\n\nI'm also reminded of that second half performance during England's 1-0 win over Serbia in their first game of the tournament, where I basically lost the will to live.\n\nHere's hoping that England have something better to offer against Slovenia in the third group game next Tuesday (25 June) and we prove that the received wisdom of the eventual tournament winner starting slowly is true.\n\nIt might not feel like it right now but maybe it's still coming home.\n\nAs for storing your teabags, do not follow the advice on Danish fans on that front.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

Denmark are 1-0 up against England in the Euro 2020 semi-final, Mikel Damsgaard's free-kick catching Jordan Pickford out, and the hosts are beginning to panic.\n\nAnd so Harry Kane drops deep. All tournament long, people have questioned why he drops deep. Why isn't England's No 9 in the box? Why is he so far from goal? Is it ego that makes him think he's a No 10? Well, here's the answer. Receiving the ball midway inside Denmark's half, Kane controls with his left foot and then, with no backlift, plays a defence-splitting pass with his right. Away goes Bukayo Saka, streaking clear on the right, and when the winger's low cross ends up being turned into his own goal by Simon Kjaer, England are back on the victory path.\n\nKane's ingenuity is the turning point. He had been adjusting after his ankle injuries, running the channels less and operating more as a playmaker, while still retaining that enormous goal threat. He is neither a No 9 nor a No 10; instead he is a 9.5, a mix of Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham, the dip in the power of his running no impediment to him pulling away from centre-backs, turning and sending a wide forward away with a sweeping pass.\n\nWe saw it so often when he linked up with Son Heung-min at Tottenham. He moved to Bayern Munich last summer and finished his first season in Germany with 44 goals and eight assists in all competitions. And last Sunday, as England opened their Euro 2024 campaign with a 1-0 win over Serbia, he managed two touches in the first half, spent most of the game being buffeted by three big defenders and did not have an attempt on goal until late in the game.\n\nIt was an Erling Haaland-esque performance: low involvement in the buildup, plenty of frustration, a narrative defined by whether or not the big chance ends up in the back of the net. Afterwards, though, Kane and Southgate were satisfied with how things had gone. Kane explained that it was part of the plan for him to play high and make space for Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden in between the lines. Southgate talked about the captain's hold-up play relieving pressure in the second half. Jamie Carragher, writing in his Daily Telegraph column, said England will not win the Euros if Kane is unable to resume his old playmaking role. Why is he playing so high? Why is he in the box all the time?\n\nYet, as Kane said, each game will be different. He was doubted at the start of Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup, only to respond with a flurry of goals on both occasions. Do not bet against Kane. There will be goals and assists. They could come when England face Denmark again in Frankfurt on Thursday.\n\nAn altered role does not have to spell disaster for Kane. Equally, though, it is clear that the nature of England's attack has shifted since the early Southgate era. One of the team's biggest wins, the 3-2 triumph over Spain in October 2018, was built on Kane dropping back and releasing Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling with clever through balls. England had pace and directness in the wide areas, with Sterling particularly influential on the left at the last Euros. Against Serbia, though, the speed was limited to Saka on the right. Phil Foden, a more technical player than Sterling, would spend his time drifting in from the opposite flank. Behind Kane, meanwhile, was a 20-year-old superstar who oozes main character energy.\n\nInevitably there will be questions about whether the irrepressible rise of Jude Bellingham will steal Kane's thunder. Who is England's talisman now? Maybe it's the wrong question to ask. Maybe, as Southgate says, England do not need a talisman. It will help Kane if some of the pressure is lifted from his shoulders.\n\nThe captain is, first and foremost, an incredible team player. Kane is obsessed with scoring but if he has to sacrifice himself for the team he will do it. He didn't actually have a bad game against Serbia; he wasn't losing balls in the first half, he just wasn't getting anything to feet. Everything centred around Bellingham's energy. Kane occupied defenders. There was space for Bellingham to make a late run into the box. In the second half Kane held the ball up, won free-kicks and hit the bar with his one chance. The narrative would have been different if that had gone in.\n\nEven then, though, the comparison with Haaland would not quite be right. Haaland is rarely involved in City's buildup play. The Norwegian's game is almost entirely defined by whether he scores but Kane is different. He can do almost everything. He was perfectly capable of fighting Serbia's bruisers in the air.\n\nPerhaps it can be put to one side. After all, when England beat Italy last October, the move that led to their equalising penalty came from Kane dropping back, holding off his marker and laying the ball off for Bellingham to surge through on goal. Everything seemed to be in fine working order then and the lesson is that Kane is going to make his presence felt at some point. It might be a towering header at the back post, a fizzing shot or one of those trademark assists. One way or another, it's coming.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_steinberg@theguardian.com", "name": "Jacob Steinberg",

No chance with the goal.\n\nKyle Walker 6\n\nAgeless. Great opportunism and athleticism to make England's opener.\n\nJohn Stones 5\n\nNeeded to use his experience to urge England's midfield higher up the pitch. Some good defending deep in his own box but not as composed as usual.\n\nMarc Guehi 6\n\nGood, aggressive stuff from the Crystal Palace man. Showed Serbia performance was no fluke. Vital recovery from his own error late on.\n\nKieran Trippier 5\n\nWon his 50th cap and was his usual reliable self defensively but England continue to be lop-sided in attack\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold 4\n\nA tough evening. Loose in possession and his lack of experience in midfield told with some dreadful positioning off the ball. Far too deep. Time up on the experiment?\n\nDeclan Rice 5\n\nLike Alexander-Arnold, played on top of his centre-backs when England needed someone to step out. Still effective in breaking up the play but far from flawless with the ball.\n\nBukayo Saka 6\n\nSo important to this team. Takes the ball under pressure and drives England up the pitch. Again gave his full-back a torrid time.\n\nJude Bellingham 5\n\nHuge contrast with the first-half against Serbia. Unable to get in the game in the opening 45 minutes here from No10. More involved in the second-half, creating Watkins chance, but guilty of overplaying.\n\nPhil Foden 6\n\nA big improvement after a quiet start. Went close with a couple of curlers, hit the post, showed his class with some nice runs. Visibly took responsibility towards the end of the first-half as England searched for a foothold.\n\nHarry Kane 5\n\nOn target for the 64th time in an England shirt but then gave the ball away in build-up to Denmark goal. That he was taken off with so long to play said a fair bit.\n\nCrucial clearance minutes after coming on probably stopped Denmark going 2-1 up. Booked.\n\nEberechi Eze (Saka 69') 5\n\nOn as part of a front-line refresh but made little impact.\n\nJarrod Bowen (Foden 69') 5\n\nA similar story, given a decent opportunity as one of Southgate's \"finishers\" but unable to take it.\n\nOllie Watkins (Kane 69') 5\n\nDenied by Schmeichel within minutes of coming on.\n\nUnused: Ramsdale, Pope, Konsa, Dunk, Gomez, Wharton, Mainoo, Gordon, Palmer,

nations looking good to qualify as winners and runners up respectively.\n\nWhile plenty could change, that would leave Georgia and Czech Republic as the most likely options.\n\nIf they qualify as group winners, England's first knockout game will take place at 5pm on Sunday 30 June in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nGermany became the first team to reach the knockout stages of the competition on Tuesday

The Danes were held to a 1-1 draw by Slovenia. Both sides still have plenty to play for. But for the Danes, they will be under serious pressure after dropping two points in their opening match.\n\nThe three picks needed to win this bet all look to have a great chance of coming in.\n\nEngland sits top of Group C with three points. A win all but sends them through to the knockout stages. We expect Gareth Southgate's team to play with more freedom after their edgy 1-0 win over Serbia. And with Kane, Bellingham, Foden and Saka on show, that spells bad news for the Danes.\n\nDenmark can't afford to lose. At the very least they have to get a draw against England and hope to pick up three points when they face Serbia. The Danes can't sit back and hope to get a 0-0 against a quality English attack. They know they will have to score at least once. That brings both teams to score into play.\n\nHarry Kane doesn't go long without a goal.

The change worked as the right-back produced the run that led to Kane's goal. 7/10\n\nJohn Stones\n\nStill feeling his way back to full match sharpness. The defender's passing was not quite as crisp as we have come to expect. 6/10\n\nMarc Guehi\n\nA star of England's first two games, showing a cool head with the ball at his feet and defending well inside his own box. He made a couple of brilliant tackles. 8/10\n\nKieran Trippier\n\nWon his 50th England cap playing as a makeshift left-back. The Newcastle man did not do too much wrong, but has to look inside too much. 6/10\n\nDeclan Rice\n\nPlayed too deep in front of the back four and could not get a grip of the game as he does for Arsenal. He got away with a mistake near the end thanks to Guehi. 5/10\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold\n\nWill this have marked the end of the Alexander-Arnold experiment? The Liverpool man looked uncomfortable both with and without the ball before being replaced by Gallagher. 5/10\n\nBukayo Saka\n\nIt is becoming a feature of England games, just as is the case with Arsenal, that Saka gets repeatedly fouled. Vestergaard was booked for bundling him down. 6/10\n\nJude Bellingham\n\nThe undisputed hero of England's first win could not be faulted for his effort against Denmark, but he was some way short of his best in Frankfurt. 6/10\n\nPhil Foden\n\nSo unlucky to hit the post. The Manchester City man was eager to impress, carrying the ball forwards at every opportunity and trying his luck from long range. 7/10\n\nHarry Kane\n\nYou know it is bad when Kane is substituted. England's captain scored his first goal of the tournament, but struggled to get into the game and did not press enough. 5/10\n\nSubs\n\nConor Gallagher 54 (for Alexander-Arnold): Replaced Liverpool man for the second game running and picked up a booking. 6/10\n\nJarrod Bowen 70 (for Foden): Part of a triple change to the forward line, but could not find a winning goal. 6/10\n\nEberechi Eze 69 (for Saka): The Crystal Palace winger could not make the impact Southgate had hoped for. 6/10\n\nOllie Watkins 69 (for Kane): Was sent on in place of captain and quickly forced Schmeichel to make a smart save. 7/10\n\nNot used: Aaron Ramsdale (g), Dean Henderson (g), Ezri Konsa, Lewis Dunk, Kobbie Mainoo, Ivan Toney, Anthony Gordon, Joe Gomez, Cole Palmer, Adam Wharton.\n\nBooked:

Being hooked with a good 20 minutes left probably always hurts. Being hooked when you are the England captain and record scorer - at a stage when your team is hunting a goal - has to be particularly painful.\n\nAnd what must have hurt Kane most of all is that it was the right call. In fact, by that point, it was a no-brainer.\n\nIt was an obvious shout even though he had scored the 64th goal of his England career and his 13th in tournament football - a goal that eventually meant Gareth Southgate's team took away a point their performance did not deserve.\n\nBut of all the worrying, error-ridden, below-par individual displays in this desperately disappointing England showing, Kane's was one of the most eye-catching. And not just because his uncharacteristically loose pass gave Denmark the possession which led to Morten Hjulmand's splendidly-struck equaliser.\n\nAfter being gifted the effort that now means he has scored in four successive major tournaments, Kane looked off the pace throughout, laboured and ineffective. In the win over Serbia in last Sunday's Group C opener, Kane had 24 touches. In this grim draw against the Danes, Kane had 22 touches.\n\nDropping deep into territory in which Jude Bellingham was already wandering aimlessly, Kane barely posed a threat after capitalising on Kyle Walker's good work and a couple of diversions off Danish defenders for his routine finish.\n\nAnd against robust opposition, Kane seemed to find it something of a physical struggle. Kane was struggling with a back injury ahead of Bayern Munich's Champions League semi-final second leg in Madrid and, on reflection, Thomas Tuchel thought it might have been a mistake to play him in that match.\n\nKane then missed Bayern's final game of the Bundesliga season but was keen to dispel any fears he might be struggling when he joined up with England. That continues to be the party line but contributions such as this one make you wonder if he really is anywhere near 100 per cent sharp.\n\nNot that many England players looked sharp in this disjointed, painful, laborious slog towards a point that leaves them top of their qualifying table. Bar a decent late pass for substitute Ollie Watkins, Bellingham had such a poor game that it was actually unfathomable. It was hard to find a reason for it.\n\nThere was nothing Ballon D'Or about it, that is for sure and it was something of a surprise that he stayed on the field when Southgate made the raft of changes that included the skipper's removal.\n\nBellingham's pass for Watkins gave the Aston Villa striker a sneaky chance of a late winner but Kasper Schmeichel saved. Still, Watkins was lively enough in the quarter of a game he was given to at least suggest he IS a viable alternative to Kane.\n\nNot that Southgate would ever think about relegating a fit Kane to the bench. The fact remains that he is England's main scoring hope and this team's leader.\n\nHe was out there at the end, leading the applause for the disgruntled fans and shaking the hand of every squad-mate. But there is no escaping one fact. Right now, England have too many underperforming blue-chip players.\n\nAnd Harry Kane is most definitely one of them.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

continually serenaded by England fans throughout - came close to restoring the lead when he sent a 20-yard drive against the post with Schmeichel well beaten.\n\nJohn Stones was his usual composed self when called upon, but had few chances to surge forward and affect the game in the Danish half.\n\nFoden's evening was ended on 68 minutes when he was replaced by Eberechi Eze.\n\nLittle of note happened in the time that remained, with the Danes far happier with the point than the legions of England supporters.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/af3JRiGcqqEWcbrmD2Btug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/manchester_city_fc_articles_899/c58c0051699187d3b2f96aad0ea63db5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Their recent wins over Sweden and Faroe Islands were far closer than the disparity in talent between the sides should indicate, and they've also been on the wrong end of disappointing results against Switzerland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Three Lions have attacking issues to sort out, but so do their opponents, and talent will win out in this game.\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate has a similar mentality to that of France head coach Didier Deschamps. They both have a wealth of world-class attacking talent in the squad, yet each coach understands that in competitive international football, the tactics must be simple and the results come any way possible, even if they're far from enjoyable to watch.\n\nSouthgate is happy to sit on a lead, just as England did against Serbia, smothering the opponent who never presented a true threat to the one-goal advantage.\n\nThey'll approach this match in a similar manner. The defensive partnership of John Stones and Marc Guehi was impressive in the opener, while Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker are defensively adept alongside their abilities to go forward. Declan Rice is one of the best in the world at the six, and even No. 10 Jude Bellingham provides exceptional defensive contributions.\n\nDenmark will have no way through after an overall poor attacking performance in their opener, where Christian Eriksen's lone goal provided a third of their total 1.66 expected goal haul and almost half their 1.97 xGOT.\n\nFew players in this summer's tournament field are owed a European Championship goal like Bukayo Saka, who has yet to score in a Euro match across his five career appearances.\n\nThe 22-year-old has a high work rate and is asked to do a lot of dirty work in the England setup, and somehow has never even taken a single shot in any of his five Euro games. Yet he always presents a danger in the attacking third, having scored three goals at the 2022 World Cup and four more in the latest round of Euro qualifying, and his creative juices are always flowing as well.\n\nSaka's assist on Jude Bellingham's goal in England's opener is his second in a Euro match following one against this very opponent, Denmark, in the Euro 2020 semifinal. Strong plus odds here are good value despite the fact that goals may be hard to come by in this match.\n\nEngland's second Euro 2024 group match will be televised in the United States on FS1, which can be found streaming on Fubo who are offering a free trial for new users. The match will also be found on Fox's in-house streaming platform Fox Sports GO, while a Spanish-language broadcast is available on streaming service ViX.\n\nIn Canada, this match will be televised on TSN1 and TSN4, plus a French broadcast can be accessed on TVA Sports. Both networks offering live streaming options on their dedicated platforms.\n\nIn the UK, Euro 2024 matches are split between ITV and the BBC.

Just not good enough!\n\n\"It might be good enough to get out of the group, but I'm totally disappointed and deflated about what I've seen.\"\n\nWhile fans and pundits were raging about what they were seeing unfold on the pitch, it appeared some of the England stars were at odds with the tactics being given to them.\n\nThat's certainly something Adrian noticed from his position in the commentary gantry: \"At times it seemed like Declan Rice was arguing with Jordan Pickford.\n\n\"Pickford wanted to send the ball long, play a pass over the top of the Denmark defence for our front line to run onto, but Rice kept telling him to calm down and kept playing it short.\n\n\"There seemed to be debates between the two of them, especially in the second half, which was very frustrating.\n\n\"Rice was playing really deep, he sold Marc Guehi short with a pass backwards that nearly got us in trouble, and it was Guehi to the rescue. Rice was poor today, that's not normally him.\n\nRice was then handed a 2/10 rating by Durham, who said: \"He was so deep I thought he was in Switzerland, Rice kept telling everyone to slow down but God knows why. His worst performance for England.\"\n\nRice's midfield partner Alexander-Arnold didn't fare much better than the Arsenal star on Thursday.\n\nHe was substituted in the 53rd minute, which is the earliest change Southgate has ever made in a tournament game, for Conor Gallagher.\n\nOn giving Alexander-Arnold a 3/10, Durham said: \"The 'Trent in midfield' experiment isn't working.\"\n\nPerhaps more surprisingly it was an off-day for England's arguably two most important players in Kane and Bellingham, who were both given scores of 4/10.\n\nOn Bellingham, Durham said: \"A rare poor performance from the great man.\"\n\nAnd on Kane, Durham added: \"He scored but then gave the ball away carelessly for the Danes equaliser. Flat. Dragged off.\"\n\n\"Things have to change drastically,\" Adrian concluded.\n\n\"Again, the substitutions will be questioned. I was surprised Saka and Foden were taken off. I thought those two showed a lot of enterprise. There was a lot of energy from Saka, I thought he was one of our best players and yet they got taken off, it seemed very strange.\n\n\"And one more thing: Cole Palmer, arguably the best player in the Premier League towards the end of the season, sat on the bench and stayed there.\n\n\"What is going on with this England side? They were truly terrible here today and think they were lucky to get a draw.\n\n\"Boos from the England fans were warranted. In the context of this group it's not the end of the world,but if we're going to go deep in the tournament and we want to win the thing, we've got to play a whole lot better than that.\"", "source":

Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled to impose himself on the game from central midfield - but it's another star in the team Jamie Carragher is concerned by.\n\n\"The problem with a player of Kane's many abilities is that it reduces his effectiveness by 50 per cent. Kane is a multi-tasking, modern centre forward who was reduced to one-dimension during the 1-0 win over Serbia,\" Carragher wrote in his column for The Telegraph.\n\n\"If Southgate persists with the same system for the rest of the tournament, their No 9 will be heavily compromised. Possibly too much. Having come into the Euros with a Phil Foden conundrum, after one game Southgate has a Kane one.\n\n\"In the first half, Kane registered just two touches of the ball. For a player of his class, that is deeply worrying.\"\n\nKane entered the Euros coming off the back of his most prolific season in front of goal at club level, having bagged 44 goals in 44 games. But, despite that goalscoring form, Carragher believes Kane should have the licence to get involved in the game more regularly, something he was renowned for doing at Tottenham.\n\nEngland next play Denmark at Euro 2024 on Thursday, with a win set to all-but guarantee the Three Lions' progression to the knockout stages. Kane will hope to find his form against the Danes, a side he scored against at the previous European Championship to help the side reach the final of the tournament at Wembley.\n\nWhile the stakes are slightly different this time around, Denmark could provide the England captain with the opportunity to kickstart his Euro 2024.\n\nGet a free live stream to watch Euro 2024 from anywhere in the world for the summer's big tournament.

Here are The Independent's player ratings:\n\nJordan Pickford - 6\n\nConceded his first goal of the tournament through Morten Hjulmand's long-range shot but can't really be blamed for a pinpoint strike. Otherwise assured and made the saves required.\n\nKyle Walker - 8\n\nEngland's best player on the day. Sat on his haunches early on as his foot gave way to the terrible turf underneath in Frankfurt, but that didn't defy him as he caught Victor Kristiansen off-guard and via a deflection found Harry Kane for the first goal. Continued to be a consistent source on the front-foot until the end.\n\nAnother largely assured performance from the Crystal Palace captain, until the end when he lost possession cheaply - but recovered well to deny Alexander Tah a shot at goal.\n\nKieran Trippier - 6\n\nA typically solid performance, though England miss a quick, surging outlet down the left-hand side in a similar vein to Walker on the right. But for what Trippier offers, he remains an adequate stand-in for Luke Shaw.\n\nDeclan Rice - 5\n\nA misplaced pass to Guehi which went out for a corner rather summed up the midfielder's afternoon. There's little alternative in his position, and covered plenty of ground as usual, but gave the ball away cheaply at times.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - 5\n\nTwo games in, the TAA midfield experiment has not worked. A few heavy touches early on and next to nothing in terms of creativity with his wonderful long-range skillset. Hooked just after half-time, it'd be a surprise if he started against Slovenia.\n\nBukayo Saka - 6\n\nShowed flashes, but it was more neat and tidy from the Arsenal winger as opposed to the end product of the first match. Notable, too, that he was substituted on 70 minutes.\n\nJude Bellingham - 6\n\nGiven his talismanic performance against Serbia, a strangely uninfluential day for England's No 10 in Frankfurt. Kept looking for the ball until the end and set up Watkins well late on, but a day of frustration for Bellingham.\n\nPhil Foden - 6\n\nLivelier than his anonymous opening game performance. Lovely footwork carved out a chance single-handedly early on but the Premier League player of the season skewed his shot wide.

labouring to a 1-1 draw against Denmark in Frankfurt.\n\nHaving beaten Serbia in their opening encounter, victory at the Deutsche Bank Arena would have seen England guaranteed to top Group C but they fell short as Harry Kane's opener was cancelled out by a long-range Morten Hjulmand effort.\n\nHere, the PA news agency rates Gareth Southgate's players following a frustrating evening.\n\nJordan Pickford: No chance with Denmark's equaliser but looked shaky at times when England were under pressure. 5 (out of 10)\n\nKyle Walker: Was slipping on the poor pitch before changing boots and it did the trick as a burst of pace saw him nip in to set up England's opening goal. 6\n\nMarc Guehi: Another commanding performance as he continues to show he is more than comfortable at the highest level. 7\n\nJohn Stones: Forming a decent partnership with Guehi but a couple of miscommunications with Pickford. 6\n\nKieran Trippier: Gives his all at left-back but England will be a much more balanced outfit if and when Luke Shaw can be involved. 6\n\nDeclan Rice: Another who seemed to struggle with the pitch and not his usual commanding best in the middle of the park. 5\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold: Still learning his midfield role on the job - but a major tournament is not the place for it and struggled again. 4\n\nPhil Foden: All over the pitch and grew increasingly determined to make an impact, hit the post just before the hour but was soon taken off. 6\n\nJude Bellingham: Not at his marauding best and was on the periphery for much of the second half. 5\n\nBukayo Saka: Not as much as a threat as he would normally pose and one of many seemingly struggling with fitness. 5\n\nHarry Kane: Off the mark for the tournament but after breaking the deadlock endured another frustrating evening before being replaced. 6\n\nConor Gallagher (for Alexander-Arnold, 54): Added much-needed bite into England's midfield to stake a claim for starting from now on. 6\n\nJarrod Bowen (for Foden, 69): Flitted in and out of the game from the right. 5\n\nEberechi Eze (for Saka, 69): A more natural fit on England's left but had no opportunity to show what he can really do. 5\n\nOllie Watkins (for Kane, 70): Some probing runs as his more direct approach caused more issues than Kane managed. 6", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Serbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/NHAWS2AJZNMAZLO4JRFB7F32GE.jpg?smart=true&auth=ab27abfb8e31ca68e730d79a78642312d63cd284326c24c6fdfca552440aa8e3&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

'Harry wasn't affecting the game at all, he was coming too deep and condensing the play.'\n\nShearer later added that Southgate needs to inject pace into the side if he is to get the best out of England's all-time record goalscorer.\n\nShearer said: 'I mentioned it but when I go into my 30s and lost half a yard of pace I needed legs around me, I needed pace around me.\n\n'I could still hold the ball up, I still had a good touch, I could still head it and score goals. The one thing I couldn't constantly do was run in behind. He needs players in and around him.\n\n'That's why I'd have Gordon in the team because he has the energy to run in behind and get up near him.\n\n'When Foden is there he want to play tight and get in the No.10 role, like Harry Kane does. He's a brilliant goalscorer, he'll always score goals but he lacks that yard and energy. Someone else can do it alongside him.\n\n'That's why I retired I couldn't do it for both England and Newcastle.

As if that's a bad thing.\n\nCarragher obviously says this knowing that Kane has more to his game than Haaland, but you know, it's hardly going to hurt England if they have a ridiculously prolific goalscorer up front.\n\nThe former Tottenham striker was very uninvolved in the Three Lions' Euro 2024 opener against Serbia, with Jude Bellingham's 13th-minute header enough to secure the three points.\n\nSome are concerned by Kane's lack of involvement but it could be a blessing in disguise having been criticised for dropping too deep to get involved for England.\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 England fans, 10 German Bombers and the glimpse into a thick slice of our culture\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Jude Bellingham's England (just) beat Serbia: 16 Conclusions on an unnecessarily nervy opener\n\nUnfortunately for the player, he can't have it both ways. He actually plays up front and gets criticised. That's punditry for you. Double-edged swords everywhere.\n\nIt is fair to be unimpressed by Kane's performance vs Serbia on Sunday and Carragher believes Southgate using him more as a poacher \"reduces his effectiveness by 50 per cent\".\n\n\"Kane had only two touches in the entire first half against Serbia - England will not win the Euros if that continues,\" the former Three Lions centre-back wrote in his Telegraph column.\n\n\"Of all Gareth Southgate's strategies for winning the Euros, few anticipated Harry Kane being reinvented as Erling Haaland.\n\n\"On the surface that sounds like a great plan for the country and for any striker. The role is specific and in some respects old-school; to play as much as possible on the shoulder of the last defender, stay on the fringe of the action as the midfielders assume all the creative responsibilities, patiently awaiting one moment to strike.\n\n\"The problem with a player of Kane's many abilities is that it reduces his effectiveness by 50 per cent. Kane is a multi-tasking, modern centre-forward who was reduced to one-dimension during the 1-0 win over Serbia.\n\n\"If Southgate persists with the same system for the rest of the tournament, his No 9 will be heavily compromised. Possibly too much. Having come into the Euros with a Phil Foden conundrum, after one game Southgate has a Kane one.\n\n\"In the first half, Kane registered just two touches of the ball. For a player of his class, that is deeply worrying.\n\n\"By full time that had risen to 24, showing that he was more involved in the second half - ironic given that England were less dominant in possession. There is a tactical curiosity that when England played well, Kane was not involved at all. When they didn't, he nearly scored and had more possession.\"\n\nCarragher continued: \"Kane is at his best when he is surrounded by pace. At the last three international tournaments, he liked to drop deep and supply passes to rapid wide strikers like Bukayo Saka and Raheem Sterling, or (when selected) Marcus Rashford.\n\n\"Even when England were in control during the first 30 minutes against Serbia, Saka was the only attacker running beyond the defence. He was brilliant, but there was too much responsibility on him to make those runs.\n\n\"The lack of pace hurt England the longer the game progressed, so it was surprising Anthony Gordon was not introduced. There is also an argument that Ollie Watkins should have replaced Kane for the last 20 minutes because he is quicker and could have freshened it up physically.\n\n\"True, Kane nearly had his reward when he forced an impressive save on 77 minutes. Like Haaland, interpretations of whether he played well or not become defined by such opportunities.\"\n\n\ud83d\udce3 TO THE COMMENTS! Is this version of Harry Kane hurting or harming England?

Kane is a great player who scores lots of goals.\n\n\"The reason he is world class is because he does not need to score to have an impact on a game. At his best, he is a goalscoring No 9, a false 9 and a creative No 10.\n\n\"Redefining him as a poacher to accommodate so many team-mates who want to occupy the deep, No 10 position will be the most contentious decision Southgate makes if England are unsuccessful.\"", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_soutar@football365.com", "name": "Jason Soutar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F17111029%2FHarry-Kane-Jamie-Carragher-quote-F365.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

As England flailed he held the line - and his recovery tackle after Rice sold him short preserved this point.\n\nJohn Stones - 5/10\n\nEngland's most experienced defender but couldn't get a foothold on this one. Didn't help that he was offered virtually zero cover by a midfield that was missing in action.\n\nKyle Walker - 6/10\n\nThe omens weren't great when he slipped in the first minute and had to change his boots. Set up Kane for the opener with a brilliant blindside run but after it was mostly defensive work.\n\nJude Bellingham - 4/10\n\nThis was oh-so-quiet from England's diamond as Denmark did a number on him. Misplaced passes, mistimed tackles, running into cul-de-sacs - by the end his frustration was palpable.\n\nDeclan Rice - 5/10\n\nSurvived Southgate's flurry of substitutions but make no mistake he was every bit as culpable for England's midfield mess. That short pass for Guehi with ten minutes to go was nearly terminal.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - 4/10\n\nIt's not his fault, you know. In a tournament of Toni Kroos, giving a man who plays his club football with distinction at right-back the midfield metronome role was never going to work. Gave it away far too much.\n\nBukayo Saka - 6/10\n\nThere was a brief 15 minute spell when he sparkled and England looked dangerous but otherwise Denmark's high line snuffed out his threat. So frustrating his threat couldn't be harnessed.\n\nPhil Foden - 7/10\n\nNever, ever write off a talent like Foden. As England retreated he did more than anyone to try and drag them back into the game and cracked the post with their best second half effort.\n\nHarry Kane - 6/10\n\nHis 13th goal in a major tournament but not a vintage afternoon. He dropped too deep to be a sustained menace and it was his loose pass that was punished for the Denmark leveller.\n\nRestored a bit of balance in midfield when he came on, at least stemming the red tide. Harsh yellow card meant he was playing on the edge but did that well. Will start against Slovenia.\n\nJarrod Bowen - 5/10\n\nWill he come into Southgate's thinking next week? Looked to get into the right spaces when he came on but this was a more difficult assignment than troubling the Serbs.\n\nEberechi Eze - 5/10\n\nHailed as one of England's \"finishers\" but couldn't get into the game when he came on. Hopefully that isn't the sum total of his contribution to the tournament.\n\nOllie Watkins - 5/10\n\nOne brilliant run that summoned a super save from Kasper Schmeichel was almost enough to make his introduction inspired. Still has questions to answer at this level.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_douglas@inews.co.uk", "name": "Mark Douglas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Shooter", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Shooter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEI_209645313.jpg?crop=601px%2C0px%2C1899px%2C1069px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Paul Fennessy\n\nBEFORE Euro 2024 began, England were the favourite of most bookmakers to triumph.\n\nIt's hard to remember a previous example of when the most hotly-tipped team to win a major tournament looked so technically limited.\n\nThe irony is that today's 1-1 draw with Denmark all but assures the Three Lions' place in the knockout stages, but the downcast mood and fans booing at full-time told a different story.\n\nThe frequent joke about Martin O'Neill's Ireland was that they scored \"too early\".\n\nMany times over the years, particularly under O'Neill, Ireland went ahead in games and tried to batten down the hatches, consequently always getting overrun by technically superior teams like Georgia.\n\nIt happened during the nadir of O'Neill's Ireland reign, a 5-1 defeat by Denmark, when a Shane Duffy goal after six minutes had given his side false hope.\n\nEngland were not quite as bad as the Boys in Green that night, but with better players, they have been deploying a similar gameplan for years.\n\nIt was true of their 2018 World Cup semi-final defeat against Croatia when Kieran Trippier's free-kick put them ahead after five minutes only to lose 2-1.\n\nIt was also the case in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley, when Luke Shaw scored after two minutes only for the Italians to dominate for much of the remaining contest before winning on penalties.\n\nAnd it was evident against Serbia the other night when Gareth Southgate's side more or less shut up shop after Jude Bellingham's 13th-minute opener.\n\nAnd there was another repeat showing this afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe biggest difference between the Serbia and Denmark games was the latter played with more self-belief.\n\nIn the first 13 minutes especially, you got the sense the Serbs had bought into the England hype and lacked any real conviction in attack, struggling to trouble the English defence despite dominating the play.\n\nSerbia coach Dragan Stojkovic acknowledged as much afterwards.\n\n\"Against England we started playing with too much respect for them, like they came from another planet,\" he said.\n\n\"It should not be like that. We've played better against them later in the match and that's how we'll play against Slovenia.\"\n\nSerbia arguably deserved a draw on the balance of play, and similarly today, Denmark could easily have turned a point into three.\n\nHowever, Kasper Hjulmand's side looked happy enough with the result. Would they have substituted Christian Eriksen and goalscorer Morten Hjulmand with just over 10 minutes remaining in a knockout game?\n\nThey were the technically superior, well-organised team and ended the game much stronger.\n\nGareth Southgate's men, by contrast, looked bereft of ideas and were reduced to constantly knocking hopeful balls up the pitch -- a sure sign that a team has lost faith in its gameplan assuming there was a clear one to begin with.\n\nDeclan Rice might have been forgiven for feeling like he was back playing for O'Neill's Ireland, for whom he won three caps in 2018 (a 1-0 loss to Turkey in the game directly after the Denmark mauling, a 2-0 defeat by France and a 2-1 win over USA).\n\nRice's former teammate James McClean received plenty of flak online for claiming the Arsenal star is overrated and not world class.\n\n\"I don't think he gets in the Man City side ahead of Rodri,\" the ex-Ireland international added. \"I know Toni Kross is now retiring, but to me Toni Kroos is world-class. He dictates the game, Rodri dictates the game, I don't think Declan Rice does that.\"\n\nThe comments were harsh but there is some truth to them.\n\nRice is brilliant at many aspects of the game. Physically, there are few superior players at the elite level. But technically, he is somewhat limited, struggles on the half-turn, and is usually happy to play the ball backwards or sideways -- these flaws tend to be especially notable at major tournaments, where the football is much slower and more methodical compared with the Premier League.\n\nAt Arsenal, he plays alongside Jorginho and Martin Odegaard, two players who can compensate for Rice's deficiencies.\n\nSouthgate was hoping Trent Alexander Arnold could do the same for England.\n\nYet the Liverpool star has been substituted relatively early in both group games for the more industrious Conor Gallagher.\n\nBut the midfield remained England's biggest problem for much of the 90 minutes, so Southgate's bold decision to take off his attacking trio of Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden felt a little irrelevant.\n\nIt was not addressing the main problem, which continued, as Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Eberechi Eze were similarly isolated owing to the midfield's inability to knit the play together with the likes of Eriksen, Hjulmand and the excellent Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg winning the battle in that area of the pitch.\n\nEngland should not be written off based on today's game.\n\nInterestingly, their defence, which some critics cited as their biggest weakness going into the tournament, has been the most impressive aspect of the opening two games.\n\nAnd competency in this position is invariably what wins team's tournaments -- Spain won all their knockout games 1-0 at the 2010 World Cup and France kept clean sheets at four out of seven games on their way to glory in 2018.\n\nYet at the moment, the solid-looking backline coupled with a couple of individual players capable of producing a moment of magic out of nothing is all Southgate is relying on.\n\nTheir midfield has not been good enough for this level and those people who bought into the hype and backed England to end 58 years of hurt surely have second thoughts now.", "source": {"uri":

Kane would end up being replaced by Ollie Watkins with more than 20 minutes of the game remaining.\n\nAnd Lineker was backed up by two of three pundits in studio after analysing why England dropped so deep after conceding to Morten Hjulmand's long-range equaliser, which crept into the right corner of Jordan Pickford's goal.\n\n\"Can I offer a slight theory? If you want to press, it has to come from your centre forward first,\" Lineker said.\n\n\"Harry does not press and he has not pressed in that first half. He's barely moved. Then the team goes deeper and Harry Kane goes even deeper and even when you get the ball you have nothing to hit. I just don't understand.\"\n\nIn response Micah Richards said: \"There's a conundrum with how England want to set up. They want to press and have got the players to press. But Harry Kane is so good at scoring goals and his record is unbelievable. When his goal comes, you think, 'OK, Harry Kane is confident.\n\n\"But the other side of the game, he just needs to improve. When you're talking about goals, he's one of the best.\"\n\nAnd Rio Ferdinand agreed, adding: \"I would be going mad. I'd be screaming at him. I couldn't have my centre forward not filling in with the workload the other players are putting. I need to see that intensity. Put their centre halves under pressure as I'm feeling as an England defender.\"\n\nBeating Denmark would have sealed top spot in Group C and ensured an easier round of 16 draw.

Possibly too much.'\n\nEngland got the win they needed but Kane only touched the ball twice in the first half, and Jamie Carragher feels he needs to get more involved if the Three Lions are to go all the way\n\nKane has started tournaments slowly in the past, failing to score in the group stages of the last Euros and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nAfter a quiet opening game, Southgate will hope Kane can find his best form quickly to guide England to tournament glory over the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instant camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/12/86216869-0-image-m-45_1718624064038.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

MAXPPP - Arne Dedert\n\nThe English and Danes were unable to decide between themselves after 90 minutes. The draw (1-1) is ultimately logical.\n\nEngland was held to a draw by Denmark (1-1) on Thursday in Frankfurt and will have to wait until the last match to validate their qualification for the round of 16 of the Euro- 2024. With four points, England leads Group C ahead of Denmark (2 points), Slovenia (2 pts) and Serbia (1 pt).\n\nThe English will play their qualification against Slovenia on the third and final day. In the first match, the \"Three Lions\" had secured the essentials by beating Serbia 1-0, thanks to a headed goal from star Jude Bellingham. They then let time slip away without conceding a Serbian goal.\n\nThe plan didn't work this time. It all started well though. As against the Serbs, the English scored in the first half hour, this time through serial scorer Harry Kane. On his right lane, the moped Kyle Walker took advantage of an error from his opposite number Kristiansen to serve the Bayern Munich striker in the area, who only had to conclude with composure with the flat of the left foot (18th).\n\nDominant at the start of the match, the English were logically rewarded with Kane's 64th goal for selection. Because they could have already opened the score during a first alert from Phil Foden, already served by Walker, but whose shot flew away (13th). After the goal, however, England stopped playing. Denmark relied on their metronome Christian Eriksen to take control of the ball against the prostrate English. A first attempt by Wolfsburg striker Jonas Wind was blocked (32nd), but two minutes later, the Red and White equalized. And with style.\n\nTaking advantage of a loss of Kane's lunar ball in his defense, Morten Hjulmand charged from thirty meters with a superb dry strike. Flashed at 114 km/h, the ball entered with the help of the post. Nice reference to the nickname of the selection, the Danish Dynamites. Apart from a low strike on Foden's post (56th), the English lions made little roar during a second half with little action.\n\nFor Denmark, already dangerous before the break (44th), Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg again worried Jordan Pickford in the 73rd minute, but the English goalkeeper was on the trajectory. If they want to maintain their position as favorites of the competition, England will have to show a new face on Tuesday against the Slovenes.", "source": {"uri": "bobrtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bobrtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kristiansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jan Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Wind", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Emile_H\u00f8jbjerg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfsburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolfsburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wolfsburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Logic_and_Foundations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Logic and Foundations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Style_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Style Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Education/Language_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Education/Language Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

I carried it for a while,\" he told reporters on Wednesday. \"Those kinds of defeats make us learn and grow, but they also make you believe you can do it, because we were so close (to a final).\"\n\nDenmark were disappointed they let a lead slip in a 1-1 draw with Slovenia in their Group C opener, and Hjulmand says there are no thoughts of settling for a point against one of the tournament favourites.\n\n\"We are going to go out with the mindset to win the game,\" he said. \"We are going to be fighting for the ball, England have a lot of quality and are good at controlling possession.\n\n\"We have had some good results against England when we had control over the ball. So we are going to try do what we are best at. But nothing is gifted, we have fight for it.\"\n\nCaptain Simon Kjaer will be fit to start if selected.\n\n\"He could play, he has been doing better. He had a good training session and his numbers look good,\" Hjulmand said.\n\nDenmark's former Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, whose father Peter lifted the European Championship in 1992, is full of praise for Thursday\u00b4s opponents.\n\n\"They were a world-class side when they made the final (in 2021) and when you look at the additions that have come in and the experience they have gained, I think this is the best England team since I started watching them,\" Kasper Schmeichel said.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t think anyone comes to the Euros without dreaming of a gold medal. We have done it before as a country, my generation was inspired by that win in 1992.\n\n\"The standards (to win it) are high and that is how it should be.

The Bayern Munich frontman had just one opportunity - a header that was well saved by Serbia goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovi\u0107.\n\nHeading into the second group game against Denmark, Shearer has given his say on Kane's role within the team and has no worries about his form.\n\nSpeaking to Betfair, the former England striker said: \"Without touching the ball hardly in the first half, Harry Kane had a role to play, in terms of staying upfront and trying to keep defender occupied, which left space for the other players. In the second half he came deeper and deeper and I don't think that really helped the team.\n\n\"In the last 10 or 15 minutes he went upfront more because every time we were defending and winning the ball we were kicking it back upfront and there was no one there to fight and battle for it because he was trying to help out the defence as well. We needed him to stay up front, win the ball and get free kicks, which he did.\n\n\"As a centre forward, I wouldn't be too concerned when you're not having touches of the ball, it's different for players in other positions, because as a striker you only need one touch that matters and he had his big chance, when Bowen came on and did really well in the second half, he had that great header, but it was an unbelievable save from the goalkeeper and that is life at international level.\n\n\"You might not be involved in the game, then all of a sudden you get that one opportunity and sometimes that's all you need, unfortunately for him it didn't go in the other night, but I'm not one to worry when strikers don't have too much of the ball, particularly at international level, because you know you're going to get that one chance.\n\nWhat team should England name vs Denmark? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\n\"I'm not worrying about Harry Kane, he's experienced enough, he's played at this level, he's won a golden boot in the World Cup. He will score goals, I have no doubt about it.\"\n\nShearer is not the only former England striker to have offered his say on Kane's stuttering form. Gary Lineker also shared his thoughts. While he recognised that Kane hadn't been as much of a threat as usual, he is still playing a vital role for the Three Lions.\n\n\"Harry Kane isn't necessarily sacrificing himself for the team in terms of the fact he can still get in the box and score goals,\" he said. \"He won't be worried at all.\n\n\"He is playing his part, he's not dropping deep like we've seen from him in the past, he's keeping Serbia deep to make that space for the creative players behind him.

Three years after he suffered a cardiac arrest during play at the last tournament, Eriksen scored the Danes' lone goal.\n\nEngland was fortunate to open the tournament with a victory, but it did not entirely feel like one -- it has the chance to ramp up the feelgood factor against Denmark.\n\nREAD THE FULL PREVIEW\n\nPREDICTED LINEUPS AND FORMATION\n\nDenmark (3-4-1-2): Schmeichel; Andersen,

Having come into the Euros with a Phil Foden conundrum, after one game Southgate has a Kane one.\n\n\"In the first half, Kane registered just two touches of the ball. For a player of his class, that is deeply worrying.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\n\"By full time that had risen to 24, showing that he was more involved in the second half - ironic given that England were less dominant in possession.\n\n\"There is a tactical curiosity that when England played well, Kane was not involved at all. When they didn't, he nearly scored and had more possession.\"\n\nFoden was deployed off the left flank, with Bellingham occupying the main space behind Kane.\n\nThis worked to good effect for England's winning goal, with Bellingham crashing into the box to head home Bukayo Saka's deflected cross.\n\nCarragher went on to explain how in previous tournaments, Kane has dropped deep to pick up the ball before swivelling to look for pacey runners in behind including Saka, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford.\n\nThis time around, however, only Saka is in the team to try to dart in behind.\n\nCarra went on to suggest that the likes of Anthony Gordon or Ollie Watkins could have been introduced from the bench to offer that kind of speed.\n\nWhile he also suggested that the inclusion in midfield of Trent Alexander-Arnold, in addition to the likes of Bellingham and Foden, left things too congested.\n\nHe did, however, point to one famous example of an international boss making a comparable conundrum work - albeit with some of the world's greatest, most experienced players.\n\nCarragher went on: \"Southgate's situation with this profile of the England squad reminds me of the decisions facing Vicente del Bosque with the legendary Spanish side which followed its World Cup success by defending the Euros in 2012.\n\n\"Del Bosque had several players who all occupied the same position, and somehow had to accommodate Xavi, Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, David Silva and Cesc Fabregas.\n\n\"His solution was to pick them all, Spain winning the final without any recognised striker. Great players made it work.\n\n\"England have a long way to go to warrant comparisons with one of the greatest international sides ever, but it is an example of how managers will ultimately be lured to ensuring they get all their best players on the pitch at the same time.\"\n\nThe Three Lions will return to action on Thursday, when they face Denmark in Frankfurt.\n\nWhile last night's effort was enough to beat Serbia, Carragher reckons that moving forward, there will be no way to triumph without getting more from Kane.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish

However, the Three Lions ultimately slumped to a 1-1 draw with limited control of the match.\n\nThat last factor has left England supporters and pundits alike heavily frustrated for the second time in a few days, with the captain's latest display subject to a complete analysis from a man who previously occupied the same position in the team, Lineker.\n\n\"In all honesty? I think Harry Kane needs to do a lot better. I think his movement was minimal, he didn't look to go behind, and he doesn't often, but even when he comes short, he's just drifting short, very kind of lethargically, he's plodding short, and that's not going to help,\" he said at full-time on BBC Match of the Day 's live coverage.\n\nHe added: \"When you're a striker, your two jobs are: obviously score goals, which he's brilliant at, he has been all his career and he's wonderful at that sort of thing, but I think he needs his manager to say: 'Right, I need a little bit more from you Harry.' I would have expected that if I'd have had that kind of performance.\n\n\"As a striker, let me tell you, he's up against three at the back [vs Denmark], so he has got to stretch that team, even when he comes short, you've got to go that way [leans right] first to keep them up there, and then you come short. So when you get the ball coming short, you don't have to go 20 yards to get it short, like he ambles in, ambles in, and they just let him go so he doesn't get it.\n\nREAD MORE: What will happen to England if Serbia pull out of Euro 2024 amid chant row\n\nREAD MORE: Cesc Fabregas' stark warning to Gareth Southgate over leaving Cole Palmer on England's bench\n\n\"So he's not creating the space for himself for a start. Vice versa, he's never really been a player that spins that much behind but it's the same thing. If someone's in midfield and got the ball and you want it behind, you go that way [leans left] first and then you go behind. And then you stretch the team. If you've got someone going behind, you can stretch the team and that creates more space for the midfield players behind you.\"\n\nThe 63-year-old ended: \"But in his defence, even when that happened on occasions, there wasn't enough of the midfield pushing up from behind. So it's a whole team thing.\"\n\nKane's latest examination comes after he managed only two touches in the entire first half against Serbia, leading former Three Lions defender Wes Brown to explain how the 30-year-old was looking for the ball in the wrong areas of the pitch.\n\nFormer England international Alan Shearer concurred with his fellow pundit, adding: \"As I got older I needed pace in and around me. I could still score goals, head the ball, get into positions in the box, but one thing I could not do is run in behind. Harry Kane is the same now, he needs players that have the legs to run beyond and make the space.\"\n\nEngland's result does keep them top of Group C as Slovenia and Serbia also shared the spoils in their meeting earlier in the day. However, failure to wrap up qualification for the Round of 16 a game ahead of schedule means Southgate and Co will have to fight to secure first place against the Slovenians on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_quinlan@football.london", "name": "James Quinlan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wes Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Short_Stories", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Short Stories", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29394012.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2158460753.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Alexander-Arnold enjoyed a steady start to the tournament with flashes of attacking prowess but also a defensive slip-up to hand Aleksandar Mitrovic a chance.\n\nGareth Southgate is expected to name the same starting lineup once again for England's second match in Group C. Those who feature in the centre of the pitch will come under the microscope, with many not expecting Alexander-Arnold to retain his role against better opposition in the knockout rounds should England get that far.\n\nBarnes believes that breakout Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo would be a more suitable player to join Declan Rice in the centre of the pitch. The former England star suggests it would aid an England side lacking balance all across the pitch.\n\n\"We haven't got good balance because we don't have four good defenders,\" Barnes said. \"That's why I think England will have to start two defensive midfield players. Rice and Mainoo because you have to protect the back four.\n\n\"As for attacking players, you've got Harry Kane, Bellingham, Foden, Cole Palmer and Saka. That for me is not the best balance. Unfortunately, we are imbalanced.\n\n\"In defence, we have one of the right-backs as a left-back. The problem they have is not personnel but the lack of defenders and defensive midfielders.\"\n\nBarnes also suggests that Southgate's efforts as England boss should be appreciated, even if the Three Lions do not earn European success this summer. The ex-Celtic boss does not believe England are favourites for the competition but that Southgate's tournament record should be respected.\n\n\"Well of course, what entails silencing the doubters? Will England win the Euros? No, they're not the favourites,\" he added. \"If you get to the semi-finals or finals and you don't win, you've still beaten most of the teams. He's taken the team to a Euro final, a World Cup semi-final and a quarter-final.\n\n\"Under certain circumstances, they can win the Euros but you can't ask any more of Gareth.

I think it will be a very high quality match.\"\n\n- Masked Mbappe -\n\nFrance take on the Netherlands in one of the other marquee games of the group stage on Friday.\n\nKylian Mbappe's participation in that match in Leipzig remains uncertain after the France captain broke his nose in Les Bleus' opening 1-0 win over Austria.\n\nHowever, Didier Deschamps is hopeful of having Real Madrid's new signing available after Mbappe trained in a mask inspired by the colours of the French flag on Thursday.\n\n\"Things are progressing in the right direction enough for us to try to have him available tomorrow,\" said Deschamps.\n\nkca/dj\n\nMore from this section\n\nExplore Monster Hunter Now GPS Spoofing: MocPOGO Launches an Innovative 2024 Update\n\nFloify brings its industry-leading point-of-sale technology to The Mortgage Collaborative as a preferred partner\n\nCritical Defect Rate Declines Five Straight Quarters, Ending 2023 at 1.53%, Per ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_canning@kulr8.com", "name": "Kieran Canning", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Kristiansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victor Kristiansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Christensen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andreas Christensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

for the team against Serbia\n\n'I think each game will be different,' Kane told the BBC.\n\n'Today I stayed a little bit higher because they like to defend man to man, I wanted to keep them deep so Jude and Phil could play in the pockets, Trent [Alexander-Arnold] as well on the right side.\n\n'Each game will be different, sometimes you will see me drop in and sometimes see me play higher up.\n\n'I think for me today was more about holding the ball up, especially in the second half, winning fouls and trying to see the game out.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

Not a nine-and-a-half. Not a nine and 10 all rolled into one, but an old-fashioned No9 to prowl the penalty box and snaffle up chances, as limited as they are in international football.\"\n\nSo began a column in these pages on June 14, 2021 -- at exactly the same stage of the last European Championship -- about Harry Kane's best position following a subdued display from the England captain in their opening group game, a 1-0 win over Croatia.\n\nKane was then a Tottenham player and coming off the back of a remarkable 2020-21 season in which he finished with the most goals and assists in the Premier League. He had proven the ultimate hybrid forward, a goalscoring No9 and a creative 10 in one.\n\nEven so, the view -- expressed by a colleague -- that Kane should forget the play-making bit and stick to being a traditional target man for the national team was fairly pervasive at the time, amid a sense that his habit of dropping deep was stifling England's build-up play.\n\nKane and Gareth Southgate, the England manager, always insisted he could play both roles but, fast forward three years, and that may be changing at Euro 2024.\n\nKane was visibly more an out-and-out No9 than usual in Sunday's 1-0 win over Serbia, remarkably finishing the first half with just two touches.\n\nHe was more involved after the break, but largely as an outlet for an England side under pressure, though he was denied a goal by a spectacular save from Serbian goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic.\n\nOn the one occasion at the start of the second half when Kane did drop into a pocket and looked to arrow a trademark diagonal into the path of Bukayo Saka, his pass struck the referee. Had England gone on to score, it might have been a significant moment in shaping the narrative around Kane's role in the team.\n\nAfterwards, Kane insisted his position would vary depending on the opponent, saying: \"Sometimes you will see me drop in and sometimes see me play higher up.\"\n\nWe are, though, obviously entering the age of Jude Bellingham, an era which will long outlast Southgate and Kane when the England team will be built around the young but already talismanic Real Madrid midfielder.\n\nTo ensure Bellingham, who Southgate is using as an all-action No10, is at his best, others may have to make sacrifices, even England's captain and record-goalscorer and the Premier League player of the year Phil Foden, who was subdued from the left against Serbia.\n\n\"There's not space in that front line for everybody to be on the ball at every moment,\" acknowledged Southgate, who said that England would need \"a different match-winner\" every game if they are to be crowned European champions.\n\nThe problem for Southgate is that Kane is not Erling Haaland, namely a natural poacher who is happy to sit out the build-up and operate within the width of the penalty box. It is a myth that Kane has gradually developed into a forward who drops deep; it has always been his game, as far back as his youth days, when he played in midfield.\n\nConsider Kane's first appearance of his breakthrough 2014-15 season for Spurs, when he picked up the ball in a pocket midway inside West Ham's half and slid through the perfect pass for Eric Dier to score a last-minute winner.\n\nAsking Kane to play as a high No9 and nothing more is to ask him to sacrifice his natural game, akin to telling England's Test cricket captain Ben Stokes, a brilliant all-rounder, to stop bowling. Stokes would certainly do it for the good of his country, but the team would lose a key element of a world-class package.\n\nPerhaps Kane is right and he will be more free to get involved in the build up on future occasions at the finals, starting against Denmark on Thursday.\n\nOr perhaps England are simply so stacked with creative players, they genuinely do not need the skipper's creative qualities to go all the way in Germany.\n\nIt seems unlikely, however, that England's best route to glory this summer is by shackling a player as brilliant as Kane, and increasingly the biggest challenge for Southgate is to find a way to maximise the generational talent of his play-making forwards.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

We conceded a great strike from outside the box.\n\n\"They had the upper hand in certain parts of the game, so we had to start thinking 'what if?'\n\n\"The manager has expressed that he wants us to play attacking football, but in tournament football, you have to adapt.\"\n\nFormer England midfielder Jordan Henderson, who missed out on a place in the Euro 2024 squad, backed Walker's comments on social media.\n\nTaking a photo of his old teammate and posting it on his story, Henderson wrote: \"Well said Kyle Walker. Too much negativity!\n\n\"Get behind and trust this team!!!\"\n\nEngland are currently top of Group C on four points, with Slovenia and Denmark level on two points, whilst Serbia sit bottom with one.\n\nThat means the Three Lions are still favourites to go through, even without picking up all three points against the Danes.\n\nA win against Slovenia would see them finish top of the group.\n\nBut with mega-stars Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden and other big names in their ranks, expectations are high.\n\nEngland cricket captain and avid football fan Ben Stokes agreed with Walker that fans need not be too doom and gloom, though.\n\nTaking to X, he also hit out at the negativity and wrote: \"Class interview that from Kyle Walker...\n\n\"Made sure everyone heard they are top of the table but knows there is loads more to improve on, get behind the team and leave the hindsight and negativity to the pundits aye.....come on ENGLAND.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natasha_everitt@talksport.com", "name": "Natasha Everitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/walker-interview.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=490&h=322&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Kane's playmaking abilities were stifled in the Three Lions' narrow victory over Serbia in their Euro 2024 opener. The Bayern Munich forward was limited to just 24 touches in the game and Carragher thinks Southgate needs to alter Kane's role going forward.\n\nJamie Carragher believes Gareth Southgate has a massive problem to solve after England's narrow 1-0 win against Serbia. The Three Lions opened their Euro 2024 campaign with three points despite not being at their swashbuckling best.\n\nGroup games against Denmark and Slovenia await, but the nation have put themselves in a strong position to qualify for the knockout rounds of the competition already. Jude Bellingham stole the show in the first game of the tournament, but several key members of the squad failed to live up to lofty expectations set for them before the first whistle.\n\nNone more so than star striker Harry Kane, who failed to get too involved in proceedings, particularly in the first half, when he only had two touches of the ball. Carragher believes the Bayern Munich man's role needs to be altered for England to have a chance at lifting major silverware.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Harry Kane touched the ball just 24 times in England's 1-0 win over Serbia.\n\nCarragher Believes Kane's Role Must Change Pundit claim the nation's hopes of success are at stake\n\nWriting in his column for The Telegraph, the retired defender quickly raised doubts over Southgate's approach, especially when it came to Kane's role: \"Of all Gareth Southgate's strategies for winning the Euros, few anticipated Harry Kane being reinvented as Erling Haaland.\"\n\nCarragher admitted that designing the 30-year-old's game based on the Manchester City star sounds like a good plan, but also claimed it could hamper the Three Lions going forward:\n\n\"The problem with a player of Kane's many abilities is that it reduces his effectiveness by 50 per cent. Kane is a multi-tasking, modern centre forward who was reduced to one-dimension during the 1-0 win over Serbia.\n\n\"If Southgate persists with the same system for the rest of the tournament, their No. 9 will be heavily compromised. Possibly too much. Having come into the Euros with a Phil Foden conundrum, after one game Southgate has a Kane one.\"\n\nKane proved his all-round football ability during a wonderful debut season with Bayern Munich as he registered 56 goal contributions in only 44 appearances in all competitions for his new club. Carragher pointed out the qualities Kane possesses, stating:\n\n\"The reason he is world-class is because he does not need to score to have an impact on a game. At his best, he is a goalscoring No 9, a false 9 and a creative No 10. Redefining him as a poacher to accommodate so many team-mates who want to occupy the deep, No 10 position will be the most contentious decision Southgate makes if England are unsuccessful.\"\n\nRelated Euro 2024 Player of the Tournament Power Rankings Euro 2024 has finally arrived and GIVEMESPORT looks at the top contenders to win the Player of the Tournament award. How England Can Solve Their Kane Problem Carragher thinks midfield congestion is to blame\n\nCarragher suggested the number of bodies being shoe-horned into central roles could have been the biggest problem faced by Kane. The 47-year-old stated: \"In the build-up to the tournament there has been a clamour for both Jude Bellingham and Foden to play as the No 10, and against Serbia they did. They were always central. With Trent Alexander-Arnold in there as well, it was too congested for Kane to occupy those spaces.\"\n\nFiguring out the midfield conundrum could well be the key to unlocking Kane's full potential at the international tournament. His goalscoring abilities can be vital, particularly in knockout football, but the former Tottenham forward has much more to offer than simply getting on the end of attacking moves.\n\nRelated 10 Pundits Predict the Euro 2024 Winner Most believe the winners will be one of three countries.\n\nAll statistics in this article are courtesy of Transfermarkt (Correct as of 17/06/2024)", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-17-jun-2024-09-03-am-8848.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

as well as their place at the top of the group - however, they will have to wait until they play Slovenia before any official confirmation comes through.\n\nSouthgate's side are still top on four points while Denmark and Slovenia are on two and Serbia have one point meaning that a point will guarantee qualification.\n\nShould the worst happen and they lose it's more than likely they will still qualify anyway given that Denmark will be favourites against Serbia.\n\nIt's also worth factoring in that four of the best third-placed teams will also qualify for the knockout stages.\n\nAs England are on four, they would stand a great chance of being that side.\n\nRelated links:", "source": {"uri": "sportsjoe.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "SportsJOE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callum_boyle@sportsjoe.ie", "name": "Callum Boyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://d1ur8kxvk6cuvz.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/06/southgate-rashford.png?height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

Fine save from Watkins. 6\n\nJoachim Andersen (RCB) The Crystal Palace defender was smooth. Then again there was not much threat on his side. 7\n\nJannik Vestergaard (CB) Booked for a trip on Saka. Fought to contain Kane. Smart distribution helped his team. 7\n\nAndreas Christensen (LCB) An assured presence at the back. Slipped the ball into midfield. Outnumbered when England scored. 7\n\nJoakim M\u00e6hle (RWB) Had run of the right flank during first half. England had nothing on the left. 7\n\nPierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg (CM) Allowed to take grip on midfield. Stepped forward and changed the game with his power. 7\n\nMorten Hjulmand (CM) Walloped the ball in from 25 yards for 1-1. Intelligent passing gave Denmark a foothold. 7 MOTM\n\nVictor Kristiansen (CM) Caught napping by Walker when England scored. Nervy when Saka ran at him. But improved. 5\n\nChristian Eriksen (AM) Skipped into some menacing positions. England struggled to pin the playmaker down. Still got it. 6\n\nJonas Wind (CF) Worked hard and occupied England's centre-backs. An old-fashioned front two was a throwback from Denmark. 6\n\nRasmus H\u00f8jlund (CF) Caused problems with his movement. Strong and quick, but he lacked incisiveness before going off. 6\n\nSubstitutes: Yussuf Poulsen (for H\u00f8jlund, 67) 6; Alexander Bah (for Kristiansen, 57) 6; Mikel Damsgaard (for Wind, 57) 6; Andreas Skov Olsen (for Eriksen, 82) 6; Christian N\u00f8rgaard (for Hjulmand, 82) 6\n\nJordan Pickford (GK): Could not be faulted for Denmark's equaliser. Saved a few shots. One nervy punch. 6\n\nKyle Walker (RB): Shook off a knock and created England's goal. More ambition, overlapping a lot, but made errors. 6\n\nJohn Stones (CB): It was hard to pick holes in his performance. Will possibly be annoyed with his passing. 7\n\nMarc Gu\u00e9hi (CB): Up and down. Some accomplished moments. Huge recovery tackle late on - after he lost the ball. 6\n\nKieran Trippier (LB): His defending remains as aggressive as ever. Problem is his inability to offer natural width. 5\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold (CM): Vanity project is not working. No control, no awareness, bypassed too easily. Unsurprisingly substituted early. 4\n\nDeclan Rice (CM) Overwhelmed, with too many holes to plug in his part of the pitch. Poor in possession. 4\n\nJude Bellingham (CM) Sloppy. Lost the ball too much, wanted too much time, lacked urgency. A wake-up call. 4\n\nBukayo Saka (RW) Forced the ball on for the opener. But Denmark closed down the passing avenues to him. 6\n\nHarry Kane (CF) Faded after opening the scoring. Furious with himself after giving away the ball for Denmark's equaliser. 5\n\nPhil Foden (LW) One super run. Bright in the middle, less effective on flank, Hit the post from 25 yards. 6\n\nSubstitutes: Conor Gallagher (for Alexander-Arnold, 54) England were more secure after he replaced Alexander-Arnold but his passing disappointed. 5; Eberechi Eze (for Saka, 69) Struggled to impose himself after coming on. 5; Ollie Watkins (for Kane, 70) Almost scored immediately after replacing Kane. Offered energy. 6; Jarrod Bowen (for Foden, 69) Set-pieces were not good enough.

However, while they took the lead through captain Harry Kane within the first 20 minutes, England lost their 1-0 advantage before half time as Denmark levelled.\n\nAnd the dull and drab second half performance from Gareth Southgate's side gave plenty of cause for concern, after high hopes from supporters that they'd avenge their crushing defeat on penalties in the Euros final three years ago. There was very little to be positive about and, even at half time, and it was Kane who BBC presenter Gary singled out for criticism as he and his Match of the Day gave an annoyed debrief.\n\nREAD MORE: Match of the Day's Gary Lineker ends show for 'subtle' BBC tribute to late star\n\nGet all the latest TV and showbiz news and gossip from Chronicle Live with our free new\n\nSpeaking to his fellow pundts, he remarked: \"Can I offer a theory? If you want to press, it has to come from your centre forward. Harry does not press and he has not pressed in that first half. He's barely moved. Then the team goes deeper and Harry Kane goes even deeper and even when you get the ball you have nothing to hit. I just don't understand.\"\n\nTaking the same stance as Gary, colleague and ex England centre back, Rio Ferdinand, blasted: \"I would be going mad. I'd be screaming at him. I couldn't have my centre forward not filling in with the workload the other players are putting. I need to see that intensity. Put their centre halves under pressure as I'm feeling as an England defender\"\n\nGary was even more scathing about Kane at full time, complaining: \"In all honesty, I think Harry Kane needs to do a lot better. I think his movement was minimal, he didn't look to go behind and he doesn't often, but even when he comes short, he's just drifting short very lethargically, he's plodding short and that's not going to help.\n\n\"When you're a striker, your two jobs are obviously score goals, which he's brilliant at and has been all his career and he's wonderful at that sort of thing.\n\nJust a few days earlier, as fans online started to 'turn' on Kane, Gary spoke out in his support, commenting: \"He is playing his part, he's not dropping deep like we've seen from him in the past, he's keeping Serbia deep to make that space for the creative players behind him. He won't care about general touches, just those he can make to put the ball in the back of the net.\"", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_duke@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Simon Duke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29394178.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_glnrPNG.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 300, "textEnd": 307}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

For a player of his class, that is deeply worrying.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\n\"By full time that had risen to 24, showing that he was more involved in the second half - ironic given that England were less dominant in possession.\n\n\"There is a tactical curiosity that when England played well, Kane was not involved at all. When they didn't, he nearly scored and had more possession.\"\n\nFoden was deployed off the left flank, with Bellingham occupying the main space behind Kane.\n\nThis worked to good effect for England's winning goal, with Bellingham crashing into the box to head home Bukayo Saka's deflected cross.\n\nCarragher went on to explain how in previous tournaments, Kane has dropped deep to pick up the ball before swivelling to look for pacey runners in behind including Saka, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford.\n\nThis time around, however, only Saka is in the team to try to dart in behind.\n\nCarra went on to suggest that the likes of Anthony Gordon or Ollie Watkins could have been introduced from the bench to offer that kind of speed.\n\nWhile he also suggested that the inclusion in midfield of Trent Alexander-Arnold, in addition to the likes of Bellingham and Foden, left things too congested.\n\nHe did, however, point to one famous example of an international boss making a comparable conundrum work - albeit with some of the world's greatest, most experienced players.\n\nCarragher went on: \"Southgate's situation with this profile of the England squad reminds me of the decisions facing Vicente del Bosque with the legendary Spanish side which followed its World Cup success by defending the Euros in 2012.\n\n\"Del Bosque had several players who all occupied the same position, and somehow had to accommodate Xavi, Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, David Silva and Cesc Fabregas.\n\n\"His solution was to pick them all, Spain winning the final without any recognised striker. Great players made it work.\n\n\"England have a long way to go to warrant comparisons with one of the greatest international sides ever, but it is an example of how managers will ultimately be lured to ensuring they get all their best players on the pitch at the same time.\"\n\nWhile last night's effort was enough to beat Serbia, Carragher reckons that moving forward, there will be no way to triumph without getting more from Kane.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etienne_fermie@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Etienne Fermie",

The shirt, famous for being worn by Gary Lineker, John Barnes and Stuart Pearce at Italia 90 , came out on top in data compiled by sports fashion retailer JD.\n\nMetrics such as online search demand, ratings from a fan website, and highest average resale for each kit were combined, to create an overall total in which the 1990 jersey came out first.\n\nBut should England go on to win Euro 2024 this summer, something tells me the current kit might replace it as the most popular of all time.\n\nJude Bellingham isn't the only superhero in the England camp. One member of the travelling press pack covering England has not just saved one man's life, but two.\n\nIn the first instance, the guardian angel in question came to his colleague's aid after a tram in Erfurt struck his shoulder.\n\nAnd within 24 hours he was at it again, dragging a male member of the public off the tracks, after he'd lost his balance and fallen over in the path of a tram.

What has it been like reminiscing after so many years competing against each other at the top of the Prem?\n\nDAVID SEAMAN: It was great. Now, our relationship is better. As a player, I would just see him down the other end of the pitch and give a little wave, but we were rivals.\n\nI wanted to be better than him and he wanted to be better than me. We were both pretty decent!\n\nPETER SCHMEICHEL: I always looked at David and was so impressed with how calm he was all the time.\n\nIt was rivalry but we had some camaraderie as well. We've only ever been friendly and very respectful. We have now become friends.\n\nJD: David, you actually mentored a very young apprentice keeper in Kasper Schmeichel during your brief spell at Manchester City in 2003, and 21 years on he is still playing at the top level for Denmark at major tournaments.\n\nDS: He was training with us and used to catch the ball by cupping his hands up to his chest.\n\nI would tell him: 'You can't catch like that!' but then it dawned on me that his dad also did it like that, so I said: 'Carry on!' Now he is playing at the Euros at 37, which shows you how old I am!\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nI said to Peter: 'You must feel so proud watching your son play at something like that'.\n\nPS: For David to do that, it just speaks to his character.\n\nWhen someone like that tells you stuff, you actually listen, and listening to somebody who is not your dad, somebody who has been there and done it, that's great.\n\nAnd now, I don't think there's anyone in the team who loves playing for Denmark more. It has been with him all his life, so this tournament can't get any better.\n\nThis sort of thing goes away at some point, at the end of your career, so you've got to enjoy it while you can.\n\nDS: To stay at that level, especially as an international, is so tough.\n\nI did it for 15 straight years with England and you always have others competing with you, trying to take your spot and you then get criticised.\n\nFor Kasper to have done what he has for that long shows you just how good he is.\n\nJD: Speaking of keepers, Schmeichel's opposite man will be Jordan Pickford. For all the doubt over England's line-up, he remains the easiest pick for Gareth Southgate?\n\nPS: It's great that there is no debate over that position, no side issues. Gareth will feel relaxed in that sense.\n\nDS: There is no talk about who the No.1 will be, and that's great going into a major tournament.\n\nI remember when Terry Venables came up to me just before Euro 96 and pulled me aside in training and said: 'I want you to know, you are my No.1' and I was like: 'Wow'.\n\nI was so proud and happy that someone was putting faith in me. Pickford's standard is so high for England, and when I look back, I can barely think of a mistake he has made. That's how consistent he has been.\n\nPS: But, with this squad that Gareth has, there are so many question marks still. England have probably the strongest forward line in these Euros, but the backline doesn't match up. That attack smells of goals but you need to keep balls out of your own net.\n\nJD: Peter, you won the Euros with Denmark back in 1992, while David was watching on from home...\n\nDS: Denmark weren't exactly well known, were they? They didn't qualify and got in because Yugoslavia dropped out.\n\nIt wasn't until I saw them in that tournament that they were progressing, even John Jensen shone. Arsenal signed him off the back of those Euros because he scored a cracking goal and he went and scored one goal in four years at Arsenal!\n\nBut they were a quality team that went under the radar so there was no pressure or expectation.\n\nPS: It was 32 years ago now. I've stopped thinking about it, but it never goes away, I'll make sure of that for as long as I live. It's an incredible thing to achieve for our country.\n\nWhat people forget is how well we actually played, especially against Holland in the semi-final.\n\nJD: So, the big question - can England replicate that by going all the way in Germany?\n\nDS: Peter is quite confident that Denmark can get something against England, which surprised me. I was like: 'Really? Have you seen our squad?' Going forward there is so much talent, which excites me, but England have all the expectation on them.\n\nGareth has got us into that situation and we are contenders to win trophies now. We are favourites alongside France and Germany to win these Euros.\n\nPS: Denmark have got a really good squad of players right now. I was in the camp the other day and the atmosphere is fantastic.\n\nI am confident, but England have got a good chance of winning the whole thing. England fans will talk about bringing it home, which is the funniest thing in the world because it's never really been home.\n\nHow will the players respond to the kind of pressure that is greater than it has been before?", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_davies@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Jordan Davies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Seaman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Seaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry Venables"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jensen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Jensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslavia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/OQ-OFF-PLATFORM-SOUTHGATE-SCHM-SEA.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663144", "eventUri": "eng-9663144", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 97, "relevance": 1}

Chris Sutton reveals all on why he SLAPPED David Beckham\n\nIn England, we have the 'Hand of God', the lingering pain of Diego Maradona and Mexico '86. In Denmark, they have 'Sterling's dive'.\n\nWhile our thoughts moved on to the final of Euro 2020 after a 2-1 extra-time win over the Danes three years ago, the beaten team have never moved on, and nor are they ever likely to.\n\nIn their country, it is a cultural reference point every bit as sore as our loss to Argentina and Maradona's infamous goal.\n\nThe Danes, from Peter Schmeichel and his son Kasper to Thomas Frank and national-team boss Kasper Hjulmand, believe that Raheem Sterling dived to win a 105th-minute penalty at Wembley.\n\nNot just that, there were two balls on the pitch in the seconds before the controversial award by Dutch referee Danny Makkelie. Harry Kane's spot-kick was saved by Kasper Schmeichel, but the England captain followed up to score.\n\nDanish football stars believe Raheem Sterling dived to earn England a penalty a Euro 2020\n\nThomas Frank (left) and Peter Schmeichel (right) are among the stars who say Sterling dived\n\nSterling said at the time it was a clear penalty, that defender Joakim Maehle had 'stuck his leg out and touched my leg'. The Danes disagree.\n\n'That was a hard moment,' Peter Schmeichel told Mail Sport. 'Especially when we saw the VAR pictures back and it was clear there was no contact.'\n\nDuring last night's press conference at Frankfurt's Deutsche Bank Park, English journalists were denied requests to ask questions as the briefing progressed. Perhaps there was a sense of the subject being revisited too much.\n\nBut as Kasper Schmeichel left the room, he told us: 'There were two balls on the pitch. Go back and check the pictures.'\n\nWe have, and he is right. Play should have been stopped. The penalty then survived a VAR check, but it was a soft award. England progressed only to lose on penalties to Italy in the final.\n\nThis week, the English camp have spoken about the Danes being out for revenge. Kasper Schmeichel and coach Hjulmand denied that, as you might expect, but Danish journalists here say the goalkeeper is still livid about events of that night.\n\nHe was certainly keen to make his point about the extra ball once our tapes had stopped rolling.\n\nHarry Kane (middle) scored a follow-up to the 105th-minute pen that put England in the finals\n\nHjulmand, meanwhile, did confess to a hurt that took longer to shake than he would have liked.\n\n'Losing a semi-final when we were so close, and it was minor details that decided it, it took me a while to digest,' he said. 'I carried it for a while. But that kind of game also gives you motivation and inspires you. It makes you realise you can do it. Yes, it hurt, but it motivated us.'\n\nAnd what about 'revenge'?\n\n'I am looking at a football match out of the front window,' said Hjulmand. 'But maybe some of the players are (out for revenge). Maybe some of them can find something in that.'\n\nWhen the draw for this tournament was made in Hamburg in December, it was put to Hjulmand that the penalty was a bad decision.\n\n'You said it!' he replied. 'I still wake up at night thinking about that match.'\n\nBrentford boss Frank has warned England that his compatriots will be fuelled by injustice.\n\n'In Denmark, they will definitely remember that semi-final and the penalty,' he said. 'Or the foul on Sterling for the penalty. \"Borderline\", let's say it that way.'\n\nThere is a feeling in Denmark they were cruelly denied a fairytale ending to a tournament that began with the horror of Christian Eriksen's collapse in their opening game.\n\nThe midfielder went some way to putting that to bed by scoring on his first European Championship appearance since during Sunday's 1-1 draw with Slovenia.\n\nBut until they beat England, the Danes will continue to have sleepless nights.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Hamlet's approach, it appears, will not be taken by Denmark when they face England in Frankfurt.\n\nKasper Hjulmand's side were defeated in the semi-finals of Euro 2020 by a penalty won by Raheem Sterling, a decision that was \"borderline, let's say it that way\", in the words of Brentford's Danish manager, Thomas Frank. But speaking in the bowels of the Frankfurt Arena on Wednesday night, Hjulmand and his goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel said the past was behind them.\n\n\"I'm not looking into that,\" Hjulman said of the penalty incident. \"We are looking at a football match out of the front window, and we have a great team in front of us. I'm not using that [moment] as anything - maybe some of the players, I don't know - but I'm looking at it as another football game.\"\n\nSchmeichel was quick to make clear he was not among those players. \"I'm not the type of person that's going to be looking back three years to have motivation,\" he said.\n\n\"The biggest motivation is that we are playing another Euros with Denmark and we shouldn't take that for granted. We have 16,000 fans following us and the biggest motivation is to be celebrating with them after a victory.\"\n\nHjulmand did confess he had not been able to move past the defeat quickly. \"I carried it for a while\" he said. But ultimately he believed the match had left a positive legacy. \"That kind of game gives you motivation,\" he said. \"They make you realise you can do it if you really go for it and strive for a win. Those kind of defeats make us learn and grow.\"\n\nSchmeichel felt their opponents had grown too. \"I think England were a world-class side [in 2021] but look at the additions that have come in and the experienced gained and they are probably a better side than ever, at least in the time I've played against them,\" he said. \"They have world-class talent throughout the side, we are going to have to be at the top of our game to beat them.\"\n\nSchmeichel extended his praise to include the entirety of English football and, a free agent after leaving Anderlecht, suggested he may return to the country where he and his father, Peter, left a strong legacy. \"For me English football is the ultimate,\" he said. \"I love playing in England, it's the type of football I grew up with, and watching English football has a great space in my heart. I miss playing there but maybe I'm going to end up there again at some point.\"\n\nDenmark could do with at least a point after their disappointing draw with Slovenia in Stuttgart. Hjulmand and Schmeichel spoke of their \"hope\" and \"dream\" of pushing deeper in the tournament and, on this question at least, Schmeichel was happy to refer to the past.\n\n\"If we don't dream something is wrong,\" he said. \"No one comes to the Euros without dreaming of gold. Dreams are a funny thing. As a country we've done it before - it's something that inspires us. Our standards are high and that's how it is supposed to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_macinnes@theguardian.com", "name": "Paul MacInnes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morten Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Hjulmand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Hjulmand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.S.C._Anderlecht", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R.S.C.

Newcastle, scoring 12 goals and assisting 11 in 48 games across all competitions.\n\nHis impressive performance saw him being selected by Gareth Southgate for the final Euro 2024 squad.\n\nHowever, he remained an unused substitute in England's opener, much to the shock of Carragher.\n\nHe said (via Telegraph):\n\n\"Even when England were in control during the first 30 minutes against Serbia, Saka was the only attacker running beyond the defence.\"\n\n\"He was brilliant, but there was too much responsibility on him to make those runs.\n\n\"The lack of pace hurt England the longer the game progressed, so it was surprising Anthony Gordon was not introduced.\n\n\"There is also an argument that Ollie Watkins should have replaced Kane for the last 20 minutes because he is quicker and could have freshened it up physically.\"\n\nEngland could have used the pace and skill of Gordon on the left-wing, which could have added another level of threat for the Three Lions going forward.",

The result leaves qualification to be decided in the final group match.\n\nHarry Kane gave England an early lead, scoring after 18 minutes from Kyle Walker's cross. The goal made Kane the third England player to score in four different major tournaments. However, England failed to capitalise on their strong start.\n\nDenmark equalised in the 34th minute through Morten Hjulmand's powerful long-range strike. The midfielder's shot flew in off the post, catching the England defence off guard and silencing the travelling supporters.\n\nEngland showed more intent after the break, with Phil Foden hitting the post and Ollie Watkins forcing a save from Kasper Schmeichel.

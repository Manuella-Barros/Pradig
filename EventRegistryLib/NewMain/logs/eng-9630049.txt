You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe BBC has issued an apology following an unfortunate incident where an offensive remark was heard during a live D-Day commemorative broadcast.\n\nKirsty Young was at the helm of the special programme, 'BBC D-Day 80: Tribute to the Fallen', which marked the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings. As the show commenced, Young introduced a military band for the audience and mentioned support available for visually impaired viewers.\n\nHowever, as the broadcast from the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Bayeux, France began, the feed switched to a military band performance. It was then that an off-camera voice was heard uttering the words: \"French a*******s.\"\n\nThe blunder prompted backlash on social media, leading to the BBC's apology.\n\nThe broadcaster told the Mirror: \"We sincerely apologise for an inappropriate comment that was captured during live coverage of the D-Day at 80 events in Bayeux. The programme is being edited and is temporarily unavailable on BBC iPlayer.\"\n\nAt the moment the offensive remark was made, Kirsty was accompanied by Anthea Goldsmith, daughter of D-Day veteran Theodore Iondies, and historian James Holland, both of whom appeared taken aback.\n\nThe footage, shared on social media by television critic Scott Bryan, received widespread criticism. Bryan commented: \"Not sure what exactly happened here during the BBC's D-Day coverage. Yep. You heard that right.\"\n\nAnother X user, previously Twitter, remarked: \"I thought I misheard that.\"\n\nA perturbed viewer suggested: \"Someone's getting fired @BBCNews, didn't cut the cameras fast enough on the D-Day 80th to save the guy who said 'a*******s' on camera.\"\n\nAnother remarked: \"This sounds pretty clear to me. Whoever swore should be ashamed of themselves. The BBC should know better than this. It has spoiled a respectful and reflective event,\" While yet another added, \"Did anyone hear anything slightly unexpected when the camera wobbled on the BBC's D-Day 80 tribute just now? Have listened to it back and it sounds pretty clear to me..\"\n\nThe royals featured prominently in the BBC's commemoration of the historic day with programs showcasing King Charles, Queen Camilla, and Prince William attending various events. Both Their Majesties and the Prince of Wales were present at a function in Southsea Common in Portsmouth where veterans from that fateful day gathered.\n\nD-Day marked a significant turning point in World War II. On June 6, 1994, an incredible 156,000 men, 7,000 ships and landing crafts, and around 10,000 vehicles descended on France, intending to liberate Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nThe effort was massive but not without sacrifice; approximately 10,000 German and Allied men lost their lives. At the Portsmouth commemoration, the Prince of Wales touched many hearts, saying he felt \"deeply honoured\" to be amongst the veterans.\n\nThe heir to the throne expressed: \"We will always remember those who served and those who waved them off. The mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters who watched their loved ones go into battle, unsure if they would ever return. Today, we remember the bravery of those who crossed this sea to liberate Europe, those who ensured that Operation Overlord was a success and those who waited for their safe return.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

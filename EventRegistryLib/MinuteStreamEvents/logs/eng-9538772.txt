So people are feeling very confident.\"\n\nThe scenes at Trinity follow a wave of similar student protests at university campuses across the US.\n\nThe encampment was initiated days after it emerged that the university authorities had fined the students' union more than \u20ac200,000 over previous protests on campus.\n\nIt invoiced the union for \u20ac214,285 after a series of demonstrations about fees and rent, as well as pro-Palestinian solidarity protests.\n\nThe university cited a loss of revenue due to blockades of the Book of Kells and famous Long Room library among the reasons for the fine.\n\nIn response to the latest demonstration, the university said that while it supported the right of students to protest, they must be done within the rules of the institution.\n\n\"Trinity respects the strong stance expressed by the people participating in the encampment protest and blockade, and we support the right to peaceful protest,\" it said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"There are also, however, many good reasons why the university's policies, including health and safety, dignity and respect must be followed when doing so.\n\n\"Our duty of care to students and staff is paramount. In order to ensure we can deliver on that duty of care for our students, we are ensuring that those protesting on campus are members of the college community, so access to campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards only. We have not made this decision lightly.\"\n\nThe university added: \"Trinity shares concerns about the ferocious onslaught in Gaza and the ongoing dire humanitarian crisis. We have taken a number of practical steps in response to the war in Gaza. These range from updating our investment portfolio with a view to excluding UN blacklist companies, to providing supports for students from Gaza coming to study in Trinity.\n\n\"Trinity is always open to engaging with staff and students on these issues: in the past week alone, the provost has met with Academics for Palestine and also with the Students' Union president and Students' Union officers to discuss these issues. We also continue to engage with our Jewish staff and students who are impacted.\"\n\nTrinity said it was responding to the war in Gaza in several ways, including the work to update its investment portfolio in line with a UN blacklist of companies.\n\nIn regard to ties with Israeli institutions, Trinity said it was for its academics to make their own decisions about what universities they collaborate with, insisting it would not impinge on that \"cornerstone\" of academic freedom.\n\nThe Labour party has expressed solidarity with those taking part in the protest.\n\n\"The students of Trinity College Dublin are rightly protesting against Trinity's financial investments in Israeli companies and links to Israeli institutions,\" Labour senator Annie Hoey said.\n\nMs Hoey added: \"The students have protested these issues consistently, and by Trinity's rules, for the past number of months but there has been little response or action taken.\n\n\"Protest that does not cause an interruption or nuisance for the university have been ignored.

are currently unable to visit the Old Library on the university campus containing the medieval, illuminated manuscript, which illustrates the four Gospels of the Bible, after demonstrators at the college in Ireland piled up wooden benches across the the main access.\n\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1rfi, the university's student union president, said there could be \"no business as usual during a genocide\".\n\nHe wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"The Book of Kells is now closed indefinetly (sic).\n\n\"No business as usual during a genocide.\"\n\nHe implored Trinity College to cut its ties with Israel.\n\nStudent protestors have also set up an encampment of more than forty tents outside the university buildings in protest at the war in Gaza and proposed course fee and accommodation cost increases.\n\nThe university said \"an unauthorised BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) encampment is in place in Trinity\" and to ensure safety \"access to campus is restricted to students, staff, residents and Department of Sports Members with college ID cards only\".\n\nIt said: \"While Trinity supports students' right to protest, protests must be conducted within the rules of the university.\n\n\"As custodians of the Book of Kells, Trinity has an obligation to protect this national treasure at all times.\n\n\"The Old Library and Book of Kells Experience will be closed on Saturday, 4 May.\n\n\"All ticket holders have been refunded. \"\n\nIt added that as stewards of the Old Library, Trinity had a duty to protect the building and the Long Room.\n\n\"The closure of the Old Library impacts on researchers, whether they are students, staff or visiting international researchers\", it said, \"It also impacts on the staff working there, many of whom are students themselves.\"\n\nA notice on the Book of Kells Experience website read: \"Due to a student protest, the Book of Kells Experience and Trinity trails is closed from 4th to 6th May.\n\n\"We apologise for the inconvenience.\"\n\nLinda Doyle, the head of the university, said last week Trinity College's was reviewing\u202f its investments in a portfolio of companies and decisions on whether to work with Israeli institutions rested with individual academics.\n\nIt comes as the students' union said it had been issued with a \u20ac214k fine by Trinity College for financial losses incurred by disruptive protests by the union throughout the year and has until 30 May to pay.\n\nFive dates in which they protested have been cited for the \"partial losses\" of College's income.\n\nAccording to a report in Trinity News, the university newspaper, the college said the \"income generated from the Book of Kells is vital to keep the university going\".\n\nMore than half a million tourists are understood to visit the Book of Kells each year.\n\nThis is the latest a wave of student demonstrations sweeping across university campuses in the UK, Europe and the US in protest at the war in Gaza.\n\nThere have been violent clashes at Columbia University and UCLA in America, where the student demonstrations and campus encampments started last month.\n\nPolice have already arrested almost 2,200 people at 43 different protest sites across the US.\n\nIn the UK, similar protests and encampments have sprung up at campuses including the universities such as Warwick, Bristol, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield, Manchester, University College London and Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nAn encampment of around dozen tents had sprung up at the University of Leeds, West Yorkshire on the green facing the Leeds University Union Building.\n\nThe university said its day-to-day running has been unaffected.\n\nBut a spokesperson told the university is \"monitoring the situation to ensure the safety of participants, as well as our wider community of staff and students\".\n\n\"Whilst we respect the right to freedom of expression within the law, we are working to minimise disruption for everyone on campus\", they said, \"We know that many in our community are distressed and directly impacted by the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza, and we will continue to do more to support our students, act to protect the cohesion of our community and tackle hatred wherever it is found.\"\n\nPatrick Hackett, the University of Manchester's registrar, secretary and chief operating officer, said: \"We fully recognise the right of students and staff to protest within the law, however, setting up camp in a city campus raises potential health & safety concerns, risks disruption to staff, students and our wider community and ultimately is an unauthorised and unlawful use of the University's campus.\"\n\nHe said the univserity was also \"very aware that this is a vital time of year for many students taking a range of exams and assessments\".\n\n\"You can be assured that we will do everything possible to maintain business as usual and we urge protestors to act accordingly\", he said, \"We are very conscious of the need to ensure that everyone on our campus remains safe and secure and this will be of utmost importance.\"\n\nWhile the University of Warwick, said the demonstration on the campus is \"being managed in line with our legal duty and commitment to allow freedom of speech on campus.\"\n\nA spokesperson said: \"The University of Warwick will not initiate any disciplinary action against any protesters, organisers or students involved in the ongoing demonstration unless the university receives complaints that would have to be reviewed under the Duty of Care owed to all students.\n\n\"The University is working to begin discussions with the demonstration's organisers about the demands that have been made.\"\n\nNewcastle University said its priority \"is always to ensure that our campus remains safe for everyone and protests should be within the law - we do not tolerate the use of threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour that causes, or is likely to cause, distress\".\n\nIt added that it \"does not invest in companies making armaments\".", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

No business as usual during a genocide. @tcddublin cut ties with the genocidal state of Israel!\" he posted on Twitter.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, TCD said that while it supports students' right to protest, 'protests must be conducted within the rules of the university'.\n\n\"As custodians of the Book of Kells, Trinity has an obligation to protect this national treasure at all times,\" it added.\n\n\"The Old Library and Book of Kells Experience will be closed on Saturday, May 4. All ticket holders have been refunded.\"\n\nIn an updated statement on Saturday, it said the attraction, as well as several other facilities, would now be closed until further notice.\n\n\"Our duty of care to students and staff is paramount,\" it read.\n\n\"In order to ensure we can deliver on that duty of care for our students, we are ensuring that those protesting on campus are members of the college community so access to campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards only.\n\n\"Regrettably, this will have a direct impact on our students and staff.\n\n\"Our libraries, Sports Centre, Book of Kells Experience, Old Library and the Pavilion Bar have been closed until further notice while sports fixtures, a concert and social events have been cancelled, postponed or moved to another venue.\n\n\"Trinity shares concerns about the ferocious onslaught in Gaza and the ongoing dire humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"We have taken a number of practical steps in response to the war in Gaza.\n\n\"These range from updating our investment portfolio with a view to excluding UN blacklist companies, to providing supports for students from Gaza coming to study in Trinity.\"\n\nSeveral groups have expressed their support for the protestors, particularly in light of a \u20ac214,000 fine the university issued to the Students' Union this week over financial losses caused by previous protests.\n\n\"Protests that the college deem to be in line with their 'rules' would not work. That is not real protest,\" said Zaid Al-Barghouthi of the Union of Students in Ireland.\n\n\"Through the fine and ongoing threats of more fines or exclusions from the college, management is punishing students for caring about the university's complicity in genocide and about current and future students who cannot afford to pay high rents or more fees and are essentially being sent the message that third-level is not for them.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign held a march in support of the students, at which Mr Moln\u00e1rfi told those gathered that 'academic institutions are deeply complicit in genocide'.\n\n\"From embers there has been a wildfire that has been ignited,\" he added.\n\n\"The momentum and the movement is tangible and palpable and those in power are absolutely terrified.\n\n\"They are terrified of us because apathy has been replaced by faith in collective action and the belief that we can create a better world; we can make a better world if we unite and come together as a collective.\"\n\nMeanwhile, campaign group Academics for Palestine said they 'strongly support the actions taken by student activists in Trinity College Dublin'.\n\n\"In joining the Palestine solidarity encampments that have spread across university campuses in the United States, France, Australia, Britain, India, Tunisia, Japan and beyond, these students are showing a degree of moral courage and leadership that has been distinctly lacking among our university administrations,\" added a statement from the group.", "source": {"uri":

The protesters were demanding that Trinity cut academic ties with Israel and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nStudents' union president Laszlo Molnarfia posted a photograph of benches piled up at the entrance to the building housing the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript created by Celtic monks in about 800 AD.\n\nTrinity College said it had restricted access to students, staff and residents to ensure safety, and that the exhibition would be closed on Saturday.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's seven-month-old assault on the Gaza Strip, say health officials in the Hamas-ruled enclave.

Ireland has long been a champion of Palestinian rights, and the government has pledged to formally recognise Palestine as a state soon.\n\n($1 = 0.9295 euros)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trinity College Dublin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Book of Kells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students'_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Students' union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illuminated manuscript"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_16_07_03_0698587.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538772", "eventUri": "eng-9538772", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1756, "textEnd": 1762}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

used benches to block access to the Book of Kells at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) as protests continue against the university.\n\nThis week the students' union president revealed the body had been fined \u20ac214,000 (\u00a3183,000) over campus protests.\n\nThe demonstrations had focused on the university's response to the war in Gaza, as well as proposed course fee hikes and increased accommodation costs.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the university said access to its campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards.\n\nIt said it had done so to ensure that \"those protesting on campus are members of the college community\".\n\n\"We have not made this decision lightly,\" it said.\n\n\"Regrettably, this will have a direct impact on our students and staff.\n\n\"Our libraries, sports centre, Book of Kells Experience, Old Library and the Pavilion Bar have been closed until further notice while sports fixtures, a concert and social events have been cancelled, postponed or moved to another venue.\"\n\nTrinity said it \"respects the strong stance expressed by the people participating in the encampment protest and blockade, and we support the right to peaceful protest.\n\n\"There are also, however, many good reasons why the university's policies, including health and safety, dignity and respect must be followed when doing so\".\n\nDozens of students camped out overnight near the Kells Experience entrance.\n\nTCD previously cited a loss of income in its response to the protests as the Book of Kells is a major tourist draw.\n\nThe 1,200-year-old manuscript is regarded as one of the greatest treasures of Celtic art.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, students' union president L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1rfi told BBC News NI that about 70 students across 43 tents had camped out overnight.\n\nOn Friday, Trinity College said it did not support the \"unauthorised BDS encampment\".\n\n\"While Trinity supports students' right to protest, protests must be conducted within the rules of the university,\" it added in a statement.\n\nBDS stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, a non-violent pro-Palestinian movement that promotes cultural, academic and economic sanctions against Israel.\n\nMr Moln\u00e1rfi previously said he believed the real reason why the students' union was being fined was because TCD authorities \"are terrified of the wave\" of anti-war protests across university campuses.\n\n\"Student movements in the US have been absolutely inspiring and we believe that we need to take further action,\" he added.\n\nPolice in the US have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.\n\nDemonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict.\n\nStudents have also occupied UK campuses in protest against the conflict in Gaza with pro-Palestinian protesters in cities including London, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds setting up tents outside university buildings.\n\nIsrael began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 34,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October.\n\nTCD said it is a not-for-profit organisation that \"cannot survive solely on government funding and depends on other sources of income\".\n\nThe student protests have had \"a negative financial impact\", according to the university.\n\nThe Book of Kells has been in the hands of TCD since the 17th century and now attracts more than half a million tourists a year with admission starting at \u20ac19 (\u00a316).\n\nA statement on the ticket office website said the Book of Kells will be closed between 4 to 6 May.\n\nThe fine issued to the student's union was first reported on Thursday by college newspaper Trinity News.\n\nMr Moln\u00e1rfi said the body did not intend on paying the fine, which equates to about 20% of the students' union total annual income.", "source":

The protesters were demanding that Trinity cut academic ties with Israel and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nStudents' union president Laszlo Molnarfia posted a photograph of benches piled up at the entrance to the building housing the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript created by Celtic monks in about 800 CE.\n\nTrinity College said it had restricted access to students, staff and residents to ensure safety, and that the exhibition would be closed on Saturday.\n\nThe war began when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 132 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, amid documented systematic targeting of civilians and acts of horrific brutality.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 34,600 people have been killed in the resulting war in Gaza. The toll cannot be independently verified and includes some 13,000 Hamas gunmen Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. It says 263 IDF soldiers have been killed in battle in the Strip since the ground operation began.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests have also been held at universities in Australia, Britain and Canada.\n\nIn Lausanne, around 100 students occupied a building to back demands including an end to scientific cooperation with Israel.\n\n\"Palestinians have been dying for over 200 days, but we're not being heard,\" one protester told Swiss television on Saturday. \"Now there's a global movement to get governments to take action, but it's not happening.

We are demanding that Trinity college show their support to Palestinian scholars.\n\n\"The college has been largely silent on this. Before we set up our encampment on Friday the college invited some of us to a meeting when they anticipated that this would happen.\n\n\"They gave a stronger statement, but it did not match what we are calling for and language is important. They also committed to looking into the three UN blacklisted firms.\n\n\"Trinity College on Saturday locked access to bathrooms and other facilities. Today following pressure, they reopened the libraries; this is a huge health and safety issue.\n\n\"But they reopened them. However, we are lacking access to prayer rooms, and we have Muslim students, and this is a huge issue. We have no plans to leave this encampment until our demands are met, and you can see the support we are getting\".\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, a spokesperson for Trinity College said while it supported the right of students to protest, they must be done within the rules of the institution.\n\nThe spokesperson also confirmed that \"prayer rooms in Goldsmith Hall and the Arts Building are closed currently, but the GMB can be used\".\n\nToilet facilities are available at GMB and House 6.\n\n\"Trinity respects the strong stance expressed by the people participating in the encampment protest and blockade, and we support the right to peaceful protest,\" it said\n\n\"There are also, however, many good reasons why the university's policies, including health and safety, dignity and respect must be followed when doing so.\n\nOur duty of care to students and staff is paramount. In order to ensure we can deliver on that duty of care for our students, we are ensuring that those protesting on campus are members of the college community, so access to campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards only. We have not made this decision lightly.\n\nThe university added: \"Trinity shares concerns about the ferocious onslaught in Gaza and the ongoing dire humanitarian crisis. We have taken a number of practical steps in response to the war in Gaza. These range from updating our investment portfolio with a view to excluding UN blacklist companies, to providing supports for students from Gaza coming to study in Trinity.\n\n\"Trinity is always open to engaging with staff and students on these issues: in the past week alone, the provost has met with Academics for Palestine and also with the Students' Union president and Students' Union officers to discuss these issues. We also continue to engage with our Jewish staff and students who are impacted.\"\n\nTrinity said it was responding to the war in Gaza in several ways, including the work to update its investment portfolio in line with a UN blacklist of companies.\n\nIn regard to ties with Israeli institutions, Trinity said it was for its academics to make their own decisions about what universities they collaborate with, insisting it would not impinge on that \"cornerstone\" of academic freedom.\n\nMr Moln\u00e1rfi also claimed that the college has threatened some of the protestors with expulsion.\n\n\"We are a peaceful encampment, and they (the college) brought the entire campus into a lockdown. \"We are staying indefinitely. It is inspiring to see so many students all over the world supporting Palestine and holding out in similar institutions.\n\n\"We have been threatened with disciplinary over this, it was a group

Some vocally supported the student's protest, others were disappointed and some were visibly annoyed. Members of the media who were present were also forced to leave the university.\n\nMr Moln\u00e1rfi said he was \"risking my \u20ac20,000-a-year education\" to protest Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"The cause of Palestine liberation is the greatest cause in the world. It is the cause of humanity and we can't stand [by] as students and staff [when] our universities are complicit,\" Mr Moln\u00e1rfi said.\n\nAsked why he believed he had a right to stop the public accessing one of Ireland's most unique cultural artefacts, he said the students has been \"politely asking\" university throughout the year to cut ties with Israel but their pleas have been ignored.\n\n\"We are stopping the flow of money indefinitely and this is the only way to pressure our university into taking the steps that they need to take.\"\n\nMeanwhile a fellow Irish student, Caoimhe McSharry, has said she is protesting because she doesn't want to remain passive while people die.\n\n\"When you learn about [World War Two] in history you ask these questions. Why didn't anybody do anything? Why didn't anyone stop it? It is happening today. And this is us stepping up and protesting. Students have always been on the right side of history.\"\n\nAsked how her parents have reacted to the news she is risking her education she said: \"My parents don't actually know I am doing this yet. They will either see this online or give me a call later or I will tell them once I set up my tent. Maybe they will yell at me a little bit. I will see how it goes.\"\n\nTrinity College Dublin (TCD) has issued a statement that it \"supports students' right to protest within the rules of the university\" but it said \"access to campus is restricted to students, staff & residents with college ID.\"\n\nThat means all public access to Trinity College has now been restricted.\n\nA large scale protest is due to take place in Dublin city centre at midday today and is intended to march towards Trinity College.\n\nA message on the college's booking platform for the Book of Kells Experience said it would be closed \"due to circumstances beyond our control\".\n\nIn an online statement, Provost Linda Doyle said the college's links to Israeli companies are not \"hand-picked by Trinity but generated by our investment managers.\n\n\"Trinity has an Endowment Fund which includes\u202finvestment in a portfolio of companies. The individual companies in this portfolio are not hand-picked by Trinity but generated by our investment managers based on investment parameters we set. As we learn more, we find better ways to refine our portfolio...\n\n\"Currently, our selection of companies is guided by the\u202fUN Global Compact Violators List, the UN Level 5 Controversy List, and the ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) performance of the company. Over the past few months, we have been doing further work and, as a result of this, the portfolio will be updated with reference to the UN blacklist,\" Ms Doyle said.\n\nStudents have also called for ties to Israeli academic universities be cut, but Ms Doyle said that: \"Academic freedom is the cornerstone of our identity as a university.\n\n\"It permits colleagues to collaborate with partners of their choosing, free from pressure from government, college authorities and other voices.\n\n\"Our commitment to academic freedom underpins the claim to autonomy that we make to government and wider society. I do not want to see the erosion of academic freedom in Ireland, in a way we have seen in other countries.\n\n\"Some in our community argue that Trinity should ensure all ties with Israeli institutions are cut. Such decisions rest with each individual academic. Some colleagues will see value in maintaining a free exchange of ideas; others will feel deeply uncomfortable having any relationship at all. Fundamentally, it is the right of the individual academic to make this decision, and no assumption about an academic's political views should be inferred from those decisions,\" Ms Doyle said.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trinity College Dublin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Independent_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Independent (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Book of Kells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students'_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Students' union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kells, County Meath"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kells, County Meath"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental, social, and corporate governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linda Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academic freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklisting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blacklisting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provost (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Global_Compact", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Global Compact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538772", "eventUri": "eng-9538772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

used benches to block access to the Book of Kells at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) as protests continue against the university.\n\nThis week the students' union president revealed the body had been fined \u20ac214,000 (\u00a3183,000) over campus protests.\n\nThe demonstrations had focused on the university's response to the war in Gaza, as well as proposed course fee hikes and increased accommodation costs.\n\nDozens of students camped out overnight near the attraction's entrance.\n\nTCD had cited a loss of income in its response to the protests as the Book of Kells is a major tourist draw.\n\nThe 1,200-year-old manuscript is regarded as one of the greatest treasures of Celtic art.\n\nOn Saturday, students' union president L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1rfi told BBC News NI that about 70 students across 43 tents had camped out overnight.\n\nOn Friday, Trinity College said it did not support the \"unauthorised BDS encampment\".\n\n\"While Trinity supports students' right to protest, protests must be conducted within the rules of the university,\" it added in a statement.\n\nBDS stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, a non-violent pro-Palestinian movement that promotes cultural, academic and economic sanctions against Israel.\n\nMr Moln\u00e1rfi previously said he believed the real reason why the students' union was being fined was because TCD authorities \"are terrified of the wave\" of anti-war protests across university campuses.\n\n\"Student movements in the US have been absolutely inspiring and we believe that we need to take further action,\" he added.\n\nPolice in the US have detained more than 2,000 people nationwide in the past fortnight at college rallies and protest camps.\n\nDemonstrators, who have been calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict, are also demanding academic institutions financially divest from Israel and companies who stand to make money from the conflict.\n\nStudents have also occupied UK campuses in protest against the conflict in Gaza with pro-Palestinian protesters in cities including London, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds setting up tents outside university buildings.\n\nIsrael began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 34,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October.\n\nTCD said it is a not-for-profit organisation that \"cannot survive solely on government funding and depends on other sources of income\".\n\nThe student protests have had \"a negative financial impact\", according to the university.\n\nThe Book of Kells has been in the hands of TCD since the 17th century and now attracts more than half a million tourists a year with admission starting at \u20ac19 (\u00a316).\n\nThe fine issued to the student's union was first reported on Thursday by college newspaper Trinity News.\n\nMr Moln\u00e1rfi said the body did not intend on paying the fine, which equates to about 20% of the students' union total annual income.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Our forces have grown up. It's a completely peaceful protest, we're still blocking the Book of Kells indefinitely,\" he said.\n\n\"People are eating, having conversations, board game nights, political discussions. It's a community. It's going really well.\"\n\nMoln\u00e1rfi described the response from the university as \"shameful\".\n\nHe said students and staff have called on Trinity to divest from Israeli institutions since the current conflict in Gaza began.\n\n\"We're asking them to make a strong statement condemning a genocide in Gaza. We're asking them to support Palestinian scholars and provide scholarships. We've protested peacefully for the whole year. Now we're taking more disruptive action,\" he said.\n\nHe said the \u20ac200,000 fine was issued as a way to \"intimidate\" the students' union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Now they've shut down all facilities. Libraries are closed. There's currently no accessible bathrooms on campus, which poses a huge health and safety issue. They seem to want to turn students against us. This is their way of turning students against each other, which I think is shameful and deeply disappointing.\"\n\nWhen asked what paying the fine would do to the union, Moln\u00e1rfi said: \"It would bankrupt us, so we will not be paying.\" However, he acknowledged that a court order could be issued in the matter.\n\nHe said Trinity has committed to looking into divesting from firms that feature on a UN blacklist, but not other Israeli institutions that the college has ties with.\n\n\"When the Russian-Ukraine war broke out, rightly so they cut ties with Russia, well they can do the same for Palestine.\"\n\nHe cited the University of Galway's decision to commit to reviewing its relationship with Israeli institutions.\n\n\"[The University of Galway] condemned what is happening in Gaza and committed to establishing more links to Palestinian universities and supporting Palestinian scholars. If University of Galway can do it, so can Trinity.\"\n\nMoln\u00e1rfi said the protest has received huge support from students, college staff and the general public, adding: \"Ireland stands with Palestine. Ireland stands with the students and staff protesting.\"\n\nSolidarity\n\nIn a statement today, Senator Annie Hoey, Labour's Further and Higher education spokesperson, expressed support for the student protest and encampment in Trinity.\n\n\"The students of Trinity College Dublin are rightly protesting against Trinity's financial investments in Israeli companies and links to Israeli institutions,\" Hoey said.\n\n\"The Trinity College Dublin Endowment Fund has invested in 13 Israeli companies. Three of these include Bank Leumi, Shapir Engineering, and Energix. All of these companies feature on a UN Blacklist and are involved in the supply of equipment, services or materials for use in the West Bank or Gaza.\"\n\nHoey said Trinity also receives over \u20ac2.5 million for research collaboration with Israel from twelve Israeli organisations.\n\n\"Trinity collaborates with Tel Aviv University, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, the Weizmann Institute of Science, and 9 others. From these ties, Trinity receives over \u20ac2.5 million but these organisations have been found to be directly involved with Israeli Defence Forces and Israel's occupation of Palestine,\" she continued.\n\n\"The students have protested these issues consistently, and by Trinity's rules, for the past number of months but there has been little response or action taken.\n\n\"Protest that does not cause an interruption or nuisance for the University have been ignored. It is right for the students to escalate their protest.\n\n\"Solidarity with the students of Trinity College Dublin. They are doing the heavy lifting on this issue and we need to see our universities divest from being complicit in genocide.\"\n\nMaking a difference A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.

that the students demand the university sever any relationships it has with Israel.\n\nAnother post on X showed dozens of students chanting \"Palestine Will Be Free!\" at what appears to be the main building of the university.\n\nIn a separate post on X, Molnarfi posted a photo of piled benches in front of a library which contains the famous Book of Kells medieval manuscript.\n\n\"The Book of Kells is now closed\" for an indefinite period, Molnarfi posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"No business as usual during a genocide,\" he added, demanding Trinity \"cut ties\" with Israel.\n\nIn a statement on the protest, the university said there was an \"unauthorised\" encampment on the campus grounds and that security staff have closed the campus gates \"to ensure safety.\"\n\nIt added: \"While Trinity supports students' right to protest, protests must be conducted within the rules of the university.\"\n\nEarlier in the week the union was fined 214,000 euros ($230,000) by the university for loss of tourist revenue after disruptive protests this year over student fees, rent and Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests have rocked US campuses for weeks but became more muted Friday after violent crackdowns by police, mass arrests and a stern White House directive to restore order.\n\nIn March, speaking during a St Patrick's Day reception at the White House Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar made an impassioned plea for a ceasefire in Gaza while expressing the Irish people's solidarity with Palestine.\n\n\"The Irish people are deeply troubled about the catastrophe that's unfolding before our eyes in Gaza,\" Varadkar said with US President Joe Biden present at the March 17 event.\n\n\"The people of Gaza desperately need food, medicine, and shelter, and most especially they need the bombs to stop,\" the Irish PM stressed.\n\nIn the initial days of the war, the Irish Parliament approved a motion calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of all civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe Irish Parliament also allocated an additional funding of \u20ac13 million for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.\n\nIn November, Ireland was among the few EU countries that voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.", "source": {"uri":

Most famously, the boycott was popularised by Charles Stewart Parnell during the Irish land agitation of 1880 to protest against high rents and land evictions.\n\nThe term \"boycott\" was coined after tenants followed Parnell's suggested code of conduct and effectively ostracised a British estate manager, Charles Cunningham Boycott. A phrase was born.\n\nA boycott of sorts is now taking place in Trinity College Dublin. TCD students are blockading the Book of Kells, based in the college's Old Library. Ireland's oldest university is home to the world-famous ninth-century manuscript, which provides a significant stream of income for the college. Indeed, the gag from detractors of Trinity's status as a tourist attraction has often been that it conducts lectures for students during the tourist off-season.\n\nThose parallel lines have crossed this past weekend with the Book of Kells blockade. The students have set up an encampment in the city centre Dublin university's square, to demand that TCD cut ties with Israel because of its war in Gaza.\n\nOutside the college grounds, protests have also taken place in support of the students' stance. The campus protest has echoed events in the United States where a slew of universities have been plunged into disarray by students mounting protests over the war.\n\nIt's debatable whether this is really a modern-day repeat of the protests against the Vietnam War during the 1970s - an era when student protest became a real driver of social change.\n\nAnd some of the actions of the US students now have been far from admirable. Accusations of antisemitism against Jewish students and academics are being voiced, reflecting the complexities of the current conflict. A generation so often accused of being apathetic and overly obsessed with image has found a cause to believe in.\n\nIn Trinity, tensions had been rising between the college authorities and student body in recent times.\n\nThe previous protests targeting the Book of Kells were around increases in the master's fees and caused a fall in the college's ticket sales. Hitting the college where it hurt clearly struck a raw nerve. But imposing a \u20ac214,000 fine on the students' representative body was hardly the most mature response.\n\nProtesting is part of the raison d'etre of a students' union, after all. As Mahatma Gandhi put it: \"You may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no results.\"\n\nThe students are aligning their current actions with the campaign against apartheid in South Africa.\n\nTrinity College says it respects the strong stance expressed by the people participating in the encampment protest and blockade, and support the right to peaceful protest.\n\nCollege and students alike would be well advised to dial down the rhetoric and engage in talks to resolve their differences.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trinity College Dublin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Book of Kells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boycott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ostracism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuscript"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stewart_Parnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Stewart Parnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students'_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Students' union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538772", "eventUri": "eng-9538772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

It just makes me so proud, actually quite emotional to see what you have done.\"\n\nShe said she realised that those involved are putting their future careers on the line by staging the protest.\n\nShe added: \"Because what you have done is what the political leaders, business leaders, what the 'so called' adults in Ireland and other societies should be doing.\n\n\"They haven't got half the brass neck or the balls that ye have and it is so desperately needed.\"\n\nReferencing the anti-Vietnam War protests that swept US universities in the 1960s and 70s she said the Trinity were proudly standing in that tradition.\n\nShe said: \"The truth is that the genocide convention says that not only do you have an obligation not to commit genocide yourself but if you are a signatory to that convention you have an onus to prevent and punish genocide in others.\n\n\"Not only has the European Union and United States not done that in silence, they have actually enabled and supported that, is the level of their complicity.\n\n\"They are drenched in the blood of innocent Palestinians.\"\n\nThe MEP also referred to the armament of Israel by the UK, US and Germany as well as Ireland's exporting of restricted dual-use goods to Israel that have potential for military purposes.\n\nShe said: \"Sadly, Ireland has done absolutely nothing to stand by Palestine but you have. And in your action you express the hearts and minds and decency of people everywhere.\"\n\nOn Friday the authorities at Trinity announced that the Book of Kells and Trinity College's campus will be closed to the public \"until further notice\" due to an ongoing protest camp taking place on its grounds.\n\nA Trinity College spokesperson said while the university \"respects the strong stance expressed\" by people taking part in the protest, it also has a \"duty of care\" to the safety of all staff and students.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

It just makes me so proud, actually quite emotional to see what you have done,\" Ms Daly said.\n\nShe acknowledged the sacrifices that students are making in \"putting your careers and futures at stake\" by being involved in the protest and encampment.\n\n\"Because what you have done is what the political leaders, business leaders, what the 'so called' adults in Ireland and other societies should be doing,\" she said on Saturday.\n\n\"They haven't got half the brass neck or the balls that ye have and it is so desperately needed.\"\n\nStudents in multiple colleges in the US have faced violent police crackdowns on their encampments.\n\nMs Daly, who has been an MEP since 2019, and has often faced accusations, which she denies, of being sympathetic to Russia by opposing sending arms to Ukraine, said the Irish students are proudly standing in the tradition of the students who fought and succeeded in ending Vietnam.\n\n\"And that student struggle changed history. I have no doubt that your action that is part of a global movement of student decency is going to be exactly the same this time round,\" she said.\n\nMs Daly thanked the students on behalf of herself, the people of Ireland and others internationally.\n\nShe stressed that she and other MEPs have tried to use their platform in the European Parliament to call out the actions of European leaders.\n\n\"The truth is that the genocide convention says that not only do you have an obligation not to commit genocide yourself but if you are a signatory to that convention you have an onus to prevent and punish genocide in others,\" she said.\n\n\"Not only has the European Union and United States not done that in silence, they have actually enabled and supported that, is the level of their complicity.\"\n\n\"They are drenched in the blood of innocent Palestinians,\" she added.\n\nMs Daly also spoke of the armament of Israel from the UK, US and Germany as well as Ireland's exporting of restricted dual-use goods to Israel that have potential for military purposes.\n\n\"Sadly, Ireland has done absolutely nothing to stand by Palestine but you have. And in your action you express the hearts and minds and decency of people everywhere,\" she said.\n\nShe called the EU-Israel Association Agreement that the EU has which Ireland recently sent a letter calling for a review to be instated as \"scandalous\".\n\nThe Independents 4 Change politician also criticised Ursula Von Der Leyen, president of the European Commission, who she called 'Frau Genocide' in her address to Trinity College protesters.\n\nShe spoke of Ms Von Der Leyen's comments that \"Israel has a duty to defend itself\" adding that she \"does not have the authority of law to speak for the European Union in matters of foreign affairs.\"\n\nMs Daly claimed that all the other 700 MEPs, including those from Ireland, except for herself and Mick Wallace MEP, were afraid to call the European Union out for fear of \"being antisemitic\".\n\n\"The future of Gaza really is the future of humanity,\" she said.\n\n\"If they get away with this [ignoring the international court of justice and international law], then it is the harbinger of a much more violent, extreme world where everybody's interest and humanity itself is at stake,\" Ms Daly added.\n\nShe said: \"It is so emotional for me seeing your young faces, your self-sacrificing, you being the only ones to have the decency to stand where others should be. You are the real leaders.\"\n\nA Trinity College spokesperson said Trinity respects the strong stance expressed by the people participating in the encampment protest and blockade, and support the right to peaceful protest.\n\n\"There are also however many good reasons why the university's policies, including health and safety, dignity and respect, must be followed when doing so,\" they said.\n\nThe college said its duty of care to students and staff is \"paramount\".\n\n\"In order to ensure we can deliver on that duty of care for our students, we are ensuring that those protesting on campus are members of the college community, so access to campus has been restricted to students and staff with valid college ID cards only.\n\n\"We have not made this decision lightly. Regrettably, this will have a direct impact on our students and staff,\" they said.\n\n\"Trinity shares concerns about the ferocious onslaught in Gaza and the ongoing dire humanitarian crisis. We have taken a number of practical steps in response to the war in Gaza.\n\n\"These range from updating our investment portfolio with a view to excluding UN blacklist companies, to providing supports for students from Gaza coming to study in Trinity.\n\n\"Trinity is always open to engaging with staff and students on these issues: in the past week alone, the Provost has met with Academics for Palestine and also with the Students' Union President and Students' Union officers to discuss these issues.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"},

The Gaza Strip has seen a \"ferocious and disproportionate onslaught\", in the college's own words, since Israel began its bombing campaign in the region seven months ago, killing around 34,000 people so far.\n\nMembers of the Trinity College student body undertook an encampment on the college's campus over this past weekend, blockading the entrance to the Book of Kells while setting up tents nearby.\n\nRead More: Hamas accepts Israel ceasefire proposal put forward by mediators from Egypt and Qatar\n\nThey have been demanding that the college sever all ties with Israel. In response to the blockade of the popular tourist attraction, Trinity decided to fine its student union over \u20ac214,000 for financial losses, claiming that the protest was \"unauthorised\".\n\nIrish MEP Clare Daly made an appearance at the protest on Sunday. In a speech she said that their actions, which are aimed at breaking Trinity's investment and academic ties with Israel, will \"change history\".\n\nFollowing the high-profile nature of the stand taken by members of the Trinity College student body in relation to its ties with Israel, the college announced in a statement on Monday that it is taking measures to divest from investment in business activities within the OTP.\n\nIt is also to establish a Task Force to reconsider academic relations with the Middle East country.\n\nClaiming that it respects the \"strong stance\" taken by students during the encampment, the statement sought to clarify the college's own position going forward.\n\n\"We abhor and condemn all violence and war, including the atrocities of October 7th and the continuing ferocious and disproportionate onslaught in Gaza,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the dehumanisation of its people is obscene.\n\n\"Trinity has initiated a process to divest from investments in companies that have activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN Blacklist in this regard. This process is expected to be completed by June.\n\nThe college highlighted that its position is in line with that taken by Government with respect to divestment in businesses in the OTP.\n\n\"In April, the National Treasury Management Agency confirmed to government that it had taken a similar approach regarding the Irish Strategic Investment Fund,\" the statement said.\n\nThe college is also to set up a Task Force, which includes student representatives, to analyse how it will \"preserve academic freedom\" while re-evaluating how it engages with states that are in contravention of human rights.\n\nTrinity has vowed to continue to co-operate with a youth-led Palestinian non-profit project in the Gaza Strip which is working to facilitate access to Trinity for students from Gaza seeking to continue their education. To date, the college has already reserved eight places for Palestinian scholars, with more to follow.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

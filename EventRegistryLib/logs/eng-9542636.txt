While Brady was often at the receiving end of jokes, he had time on stage as well. At one point, the NFL legend proceeded to throw jabs at the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest,\" Brady said, per MLFootball. \"It helps when your fans are 14 year-old girls. And in honor of Tay Tay (Taylor Swift), let's take a look at the Chiefs eras; terrible for 50 years, good for 5. Shake it off.\"\n\nWhew -- talk about not holding back. To be fair, it might be reasonable for Chiefs fans to let this one go, considering the amount of jokes Brady had to endure. Throughout the night, the Patriots icon was hurdled with roasts on different topics.\n\nFrom the Deflategate scandal to Brady's divorce with Giselle Bundchen, to Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft, the night had jokes covering plenty of topics. Various celebrities, comedians and fellow athletes took the stage to entertain the crowd, and the event itself did not disappoint.\n\nWhile Brady himself seemed to be smiling the entire time, many of the roasts were hilariously brutal. So if the Chiefs fandom wants a rebuttal at Tom Brady, it'll be hard to come up with one since there was practically no stone left unturned during the show.\n\nSpeaking of Taylor Swift...\n\nThe relationship of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift became one of the most talked-about celebrity storylines in recent times. It's expected, considering Swift's massive following. With all the Swifties in tow, the Chiefs arguably gained plenty of new fans...and it's made the franchise even more resented by other fanbases as well.\n\nThroughout the season, fans of other teams used the topic to throw barbs at the Chiefs, while many expressed their annoyance at how much media coverage Swift and Kelce were receiving.\n\nDespite all the noise, however, it didn't faze the Chiefs. Kansas City may not have entered the playoffs as a number-one seed, but the Chiefs showed why they're still the number-one team in the league. They blew out the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card round and followed that up with a tightly contested victory over Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThen came the heavyweights. During the AFC Championship Game, the team overcame the top-seeded Baltimore Ravens with a strong second half from the Chiefs' defense. This set them up for a Super Bowl clash with none other than Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nDuring the SB, the Chiefs found themselves down at the half, but they managed to rally and send the game into overtime. To seal the deal, Mahomes threw a pass to wideout Mecole Hardman, giving the franchise its third Super Bowl title in five years.\n\nAnd much to the despair of opposing fans, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift celebrated the victory with plenty of affection in the middle of the field.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_buyawe@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brian Buyawe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflategate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Medical", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chiefs-news-Tom-Brady-hits-Kansas-City-with-hilarious-Taylor-Swift-joke-during-Netflix-roasting.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542636", "eventUri": "eng-9542636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Terrible for 50 years, good for five. 'Shake it off'.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years. Off the field, Swift, 34, and Kelce's high-profile relationship helped the football team continue to make headlines since the couple took things public in September 2023.\n\nAfter Swift started to show her support at Kansas City Chiefs' games, the NFL decided to capitalize off the attention by using her music for promotional clips and often pointing the camera at her during broadcasts.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell was all for the romance, telling CBS in November 2023, \"They seem to be enjoying their relationship. That's great in and of itself, but it has connected more fans of Taylor's and more fans of the NFL in some ways. [Swift is] an unbelievable artist, obviously, Travis is an unbelievable player and I think it's great for the league to have that kind of attention -- so we welcome it.\"\n\n\"I don't know how they know what suite I'm in. There's a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don't know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don't know if I'm being shown 17 times or once,\" Swift told TIME in December 2023 about the attention. \"I'm just there to support Travis. I have no awareness of if I'm being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads and Chads.\"\n\nSwift maintained that she had no regrets about putting her personal life into the spotlight, adding, \"When you say a relationship is public, that means I'm going to see him do what he loves, we're showing up for each other, other people are there and we don't care. The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you're seeing someone. And we're just proud of each other.\"\n\nThe pair took that in stride by sharing several memorable onscreen moments as the Chiefs progressed to the Super Bowl, sharing several kisses and exchanged \"I love yous\" as cameras on the field after a playoff game in January.\n\nSwift was also by Kelce's side when the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime one month later at the Super Bowl. In turn, Kelce jetted off overseas to cheer for Swift during multiple stops on her Eras Tour.\n\n\"I don't know how I [pulled Taylor] because she wasn't into sports.

Good for five, shake it off.\"\n\nThis commentary, however playful, was not met with universal laughter. Fans and observers were quick to jump into the fray, offering a mix of defense and critique. Some highlighted the historic rivalry between Brady's teams and the Chiefs, asserting those confrontations as unforgettable. Others especially Swift's fans, known for their impassioned defense of the global pop star, were quick to hit back at Brady.\n\n\"Oh look someone's jealous,\" one commented. Another called Brady \"Toxic\" on social media, \"This is not how you grow the game of football. Ik it feels threatening to ur toxic lil boys club but you should be welcoming & celebrating young kids being introduced to the sport for the first time!!\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Brady's roast, the conversation extends beyond mere jokes. It delves into fan culture, the intersection of sports and entertainment, and the evolving dynamics of NFL fandom.\n\nThe event, brimming with bold humor, has also highlighted the intricate web of loyalties and rivalries that define the contemporary sports landscape.

Swifties can also pat themselves on the back as they helped the Chiefs break several NFL records this past season.\n\nThe A-list couple weren't the only celebrities to be at the butt of Brady's jokes, he also roasted Kim Kardashian and her ex-husband Kanye West, saying, \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight, not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\"\n\nAs far as jokes made at Brady's expense, many were related to the highs and lows of his career in the NFL and several others had to do with his past relationship with his now ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, with whom he shares son Benjamin, 14, and daughter Vivian, 11, as well as ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan, whom he shares his eldest son, Jack, 16.\n\nBrady was seemingly prepared for the roast, unlike those he poked fun at. Before the event, he told reporters: \"It's like a football game.

Swifties can also pat themselves on the back as they helped the Chiefs break several NFL records this past season.\n\nThe A-list couple weren't the only celebrities to be at the butt of Brady's jokes, he also roasted Kim Kardashian and her ex-husband Kanye West, saying, \"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight, not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad.\"\n\nAs far as jokes made at Brady's expense, many were related to the highs and lows of his career in the NFL and several others had to do with his past relationship with his now ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, with whom he shares son Benjamin, 14, and daughter Vivian, 11, as well as ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan, whom he shares his eldest son, Jack, 16.\n\nBrady was seemingly prepared for the roast, unlike those he poked fun at. Before the event, he told reporters: \"It's like a football game. You run with a game plan, and then you get to see kind of how the strategy goes, and then you adjust on the fly.\"\n\n\"This is what a locker room has been like for me for all these years,\" he added. \"So it's not like I'm used to people not making fun of me.\"\n\nNext: What Tom Brady Really Thought of Travis Kelce's Altercation With Coach Andy Reid", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marisa_losciale@heraldonline.com", "name": "Marisa Losciale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Moynahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Moynahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/u028yw/picture288351995/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/03824907-39e6-4600-9321-cd31693c29e7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542636", "eventUri": "eng-9542636", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 301, "textEnd": 306}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

But, perhaps the biggest fumble came from the seven-time Super Bowl champion himself when he aimed at the back-to-back reigning champs, the Kansas City Chiefs... and Swifties?\n\nBrady said:\n\nKansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest? It helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls.\n\nAnd in honor of Tay-Tay, let's take a look at the Chiefs' eras. Terrible for fifty years, good for five. Shake it off.\n\nWell no, Tom. Kansas City didn't say that Arrowhead Stadium is the loudest, Guinness World Records did. That record was set on September 29, 2014, with a noise level of 142.2 decibels. This sound level is louder than a jet plane flying 100 feet overhead.\n\nI would expect Brady to know this information since he was there when it happened. It was a Monday Night Football game, where KC handed the Patriots a 14-41 loss, among one of New England Coach Bill Belichick's most devastating blowouts. To add insult to injury, in the fourth quarter, Brady was benched.\n\nThis was a key matchup against the teams, as it came with Andy Reid's arrival in Kansas City as head coach. Immediately following the game, Belichick shot off the infamous phrase, \"We're on to Cincinnati,\" and sports commentators proclaimed the New England dynasty was dead.\n\nThe game served as a wake-up call, and the Pats went on to win the Super Bowl that year. The following year, the Chiefs and the Patriots faced off in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, with New England coming out on top by seven points, signifying the beginning of the end for veteran quarterback Alex Smith in Kansas City. This would lead to Brady vs. Patrick Mahomes.\n\nDo these seem like facts that just slip your mind, if you are Brady? Or pivotal moments in his storied career?\n\nIt is also objectively untrue that the Chiefs were \"terrible for 50 years.\" Kansas City was terrible in the playoffs for 50 years, but they had many winning seasons and had a nine-win streak season-opener in 2013... thanks to a stellar defense that didn't suck. Pretending there weren't good years for half a century isn't true. The 50 seasons between Super Bowl wins didn't all start the same, they just ended the same.\n\nAlso, the MNF game was nearly nine years to the day before the pop artist Taylor Swift's first-ever Chiefs football game attendance. The record has nothing to do with what Chiefs fans \"say,\" or the assistance of Swifties, almost a decade before they joined the football franchise's fanbase.\n\nMaybe some people find false information to be hilarious comedic material, but I like the \"it's funny because it's true\" type of jokes. Plus I've seen this guy fake enough stuff, including his own retirement.\n\nFor everyone remaining in the sport, the Chiefs will once again pose a problem this year after refreshing their wide receiver room by signing Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown from the Cardinals and drafting Xavier Worthy out of the University of Texas, who had the fastest 40-yard dash in NFL combine history.\n\nIn the meantime, I suppose Chiefs owner Clark Hunt will keep polishing his Lombardis while nay-sayers come up with a fresh batch of Taylor Swift jokes.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news",

Gronk continues by saying that the Cleveland native is killing it on and off the field.\n\nAccording to ET, the former NFL star also joked about not being mentioned in Swift's newest album, The Tortured Poets Department.

Gronkowski also went a similar route by saying some nice things about The Kansas City Chiefs tight end. Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce did not attend Brady's roast. However, they are still spending plenty of time together before Swift heads back out on tour.\n\nHowever, the couple recently had an exciting weekend in Las Vegas thanks to Patrick Mahomes' charity event being hosted there.

Opposing receivers will get open quicker, but that won't matter if the quarterback is scrambling from a collapsing pocket.

He was known for many things, including breaking records and winning Super Bowls. One thing he wasn't known for was roasting other players and teams.\n\nThat all changed tonight during his live roast on Netflix. After being ruthlessly roasted throughout the night, he took shots at nearly everyone he could, including the Chiefs, or more specifically, Travis Kelce and his current girlfriend, Taylor Swift.\n\nAri Meirov posted a clip of the now viral roast on his X page. Brady can be seen absolutely torching the famous couple and Travis' team by stating that the Chiefs' claim of having the loudest stadium in the league was based on its being filled with \"14-year-old girls.\"\n\nAlso Read: VIDEO: Bill Belichick Ruthlessly Destroyed Patriots Owner Robert Kraft During \"The Roast Of Tom Brady\"\n\nSwifties Are Not Happy With Tom Brady\n\nAfter the clip was posted to X, one fan quickly defended the reigning back-to-back Super Bowl champions by pointing out the record-setting games between the Brady-led Patriots and the Kelce's Chiefs from 2014, stating, \"The night we got that record. Rent free.\"\n\nAnother fan reacted by pointing out that Brady may be in danger of some Swift reaction from fans of the popstar, stating, \"They about to drop his home and IP address for this,\" this being in reference to Swift's fans being notoriously ruthless to any negation of her success.\n\nAfter the roast, it is now clear that absolutely nothing is off the table for the NFL's most outstanding player of all time.

(Kardashian, for her part, was also on hand to share several jokes at Brady's expense.)\n\nWhen Brady himself took the mic, however, he couldn't help but take a swing at Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs with a missile aimed at Swifties.\n\n\"Kansas City, you say your stadium is the loudest. It helps when all your fans are 14-year-old girls,\" he joked, later adding: \"In honor of Tay Tay, let's take a look at the Chiefs' eras. Terrible for 50 years, good for five. Shake it off.\"\n\nFans, needless to say, did not appreciate Brady's commentary.\n\nMultiple social media users thought the remarks were sexist.\n\n\"This just show how toxic and misogynist football is,\" one person wrote via X (formerly known as Twitter). Another referred to the former New England Patriots quarterback as \"a misogynist a******.\"\n\nOthers just completely disagreed with the whole narrative.\n\n\"The 'Taylor fans being 14' is such a tired and unoriginal thing to say LOL,\" wrote a fan. \"Like yeah I was a 14 year old fan 10 years ago and I'm still here now. That joke is ridiculously old, find a new one buddy.\"\n\n\"Always sooo tired of the 'Taylor's fan base is 14 year old girls' narrative,\" shared another person. \"Because the only time that was true was in the beginning of her career. She still has young fans, of course, but a huge portion are older than that. She's a grown woman and her fans are adults too.\"\n\nKelce, for his part, acknowledged -- and praised -- the powerful impact Swift (and her fans) have had on the NFL since he began dating the singer-songwriter last summer.\n\n\"It's fun, man. I'm having a blast in life, baby. Just flyin' high. Enjoying it all,\" he gushed on his and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast earlier this year about his romance with Swift. \"Bringing new lives to the football world, and opening the football world up to new things as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_mcgahan@newsweek.com", "name": "Michelle McGahan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388496/tom-brady.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542636", "eventUri": "eng-9542636", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 106}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The duo split before Jack was born in August 2007 and Tom had already moved on with Gisele, 43, at the time of the now-teenager's birth.\n\nThis scandal was referenced during Tom's roast, as Nikki Glaser joked, \"Tom, you're the best to ever play for too long. You retired, then came back, then retired. I get it. It's hard to walk away from something that isn't your pregnant girlfriend. To be fair, he didn't know. He just thought she was getting fat.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Glaser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Glaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Moynahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Moynahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelces-Romance-Mocked-by-Tom-Brady.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542636", "eventUri": "eng-9542636", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-11", "textStart": 554, "textEnd": 565}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 862, "textEnd": 867}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 962, "textEnd": 967}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1042, "textEnd": 1047}, {"amb": false, "date": "2007-08-", "textStart": 1509, "textEnd": 1520}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

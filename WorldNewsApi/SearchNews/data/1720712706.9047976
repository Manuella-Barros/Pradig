The polls for ARD and ZDF public television showed support for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats at 14%, below the 15.8% they managed in 2019 and far below their showing in Germany's last national election in 2021. Alternative for Germany, or AfD, was seen winning up to 16.5% of the vote. That\u2019s better than its showing of 11% in 2019 but still some way short of its poll ratings at the beginning of the year. The party has seen a string of setbacks since then, including scandals surrounding its two lead candidates for the European Parliament. The polls showed the environmentalist Greens, the second-biggest party in Scholz's coalition, falling from a very successful 20.5% five years ago to around 12%. Support for the pro-business Free Democrats, the third party in the quarrelsome and unpopular government, was seen at 5%. The exit polls gave a clear lead to the center-right Union bloc, now the main opposition force, putting its support at around 30%. That's in line with its 2019 result and better than its showing in the last national election. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is a member of the Christian Democratic Union, the dominant party in the two-party bloc. Kevin K\u00fchnert, the Social Democrats' general secretary, said that \u201cthis is a hard defeat for us today.\" He vowed that \u201cwe will come back, we will fight our way out of this.\" The exit polls showed a new political party founded by prominent opposition politician Sahra Wagenknecht, which combines left-wing economic policy with a restrictive approach to migration and opposition to weapons supplies to Ukraine, taking up to 6% of the vote. Germany has 96 of the 720 seats in the new European Parliament, the biggest single share.", "summary": "Exit polls point to very weak results for Germany&rsquo;s governing parties and gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany in Sunday&rsquo;s vote for the European Parliament, while the mainstream conservative opposition is set to remain the country&rsquo;s stronges...", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/german-exit-polls-point-gains-european-election-weak-110966896", "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/4909c00c-0fc2-4aad-8874-32b003b1326a/wirestory_6fcc456416033ef9440f212fca4f7818_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:38:26", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.17}

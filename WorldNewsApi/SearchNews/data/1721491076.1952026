{"id": 237089642, "title": "How free music lessons could be put 'at risk' in Scotland amid row over outsourcing plans", "text": "The future of free instrumental music tuition for school pupils in Scotland will be put in doubt if outsourcing plans are approved today, campaigners have warned. Councillors in East Ayrshire are meeting on Tuesday to discuss a shake-up of various services amid an estimated budget gap of \u00a332 million to 2026/27. Concerns have been growing over a move to transfer the council\u2019s instrumental music service to East Ayrshire Leisure Trust - an arm\u2019s-length body created in 2013. The move would impact the service manager and 13.4 full-time equivalent jobs. Campaigners fear it could also open the door for the potential reintroduction of fees for music lessons across Scotland in future if other councils follow suit. They say transferring staff from an education department to a charitable body would create a \u201cgrey area\u201d in the rules ensuring free tuition, and they have been alarmed by documents discussing \u201copportunities for income generation\u201d as a result of the switch. The SNP Government scrapped charges for learning an instrument in Scotland in 2021, with the decision subsequently resulting in a significant increase in the number of pupils taking lessons. Alastair Orr, a brass teacher and long-time campaigner, said: \u201cTo outsource instrumental and vocal education, from its rightful place at the heart of the music curriculum in Scotland's schools, would see the future of music tuition placed in serious jeopardy. \u201cAny transfer to a trust or charity ignores the need for these organisations to constantly generate income to continue to operate. This would bring about an irresistible pressure to reintroduce fees and charges for instrumental or vocal lessons, with a devastating effect on the number of children able to access music tuition in schools.\u201d Both the Educational Institute of Scotland and Unison trade unions have also raised concerns about the plans, criticising the lack of consultation. John Wallace, former principal of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, told The Scotsman: \u201cThey have got absolutely stellar staff in East Ayrshire, I know most of them personally, and they have been very distinguished - one of them has been in the National Orchestra of Wales and all the rest of it. \u201cI just don\u2019t see them staying under the new circumstances, because I don\u2019t think pay and conditions will be as good. It\u2019s just going to be dilution of the quality of what has been an exemplary service. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very retrograde step for music education.\u201d If the recommendations are agreed on Tuesday, the local authority has pledged further engagement before a final decision in October, with a view to making the changes for the 2025/26 academic year. Officials say instrumental music is generally offered through independent music trusts in much of the rest of the UK, although in Scotland the only area is Highland, where the service was transferred to High Life Highland in 2018. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: \u201cEast Ayrshire Council is currently working on a number of cross-cutting reviews. The purpose of these reviews is to ensure the council can deliver sustainable high-quality services within the resources available. \u201cThe council can also confirm that trade unions have expressed concern regarding their level of involvement in scoping these proposals and the level of engagement that has taken place. \u201cIf agreed at the meeting of council tomorrow, Tuesday, June 18, officers will spend time addressing these issues and will revert back to elected members in October for final decisions.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Campaigners fear \u2018stellar\u2019 staff will leave if proposals are approved</p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/education/how-free-music-lessons-could-be-put-at-risk-in-scotland-amid-a-row-over-outsourcing-plans-4668803", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjkwNjBmYWJmLTcyYWQtNDk2Ny05NzRhLWI2NGYzYTRhZWEyZjpjMTUxNmNkNy1iZTlkLTRmNDktOGY3NS1kZjI1NjcwOTJlYzk=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:31:44", "author": "Calum Ross", "authors": ["Calum Ross"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.093}

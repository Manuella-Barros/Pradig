{"id": 225043212, "title": "How our toxic beauty culture drove me out of the industry", "text": "When I had imagined buying faces, I hadn\u2019t imagined it like this. I\u2019d pictured them made of silicon and wrapped in cellophane, lips contorted in a carton of pure expression. You\u2019d unwrap your face and press it on to your skin like a mask until it fused, seamless and smiling. What we were discussing was more insidious than that. Sitting in the middle of the Spanish desert, in a conference room surrounded by dust, we planned the future of our technology. The app we were building was pink and peach \u2014 white screens with a gradient of flesh tones and a bold, black logo at the top. There were images: endless images of women. Carousels and galleries sorted by trending part \u2014 brows, lips, cheeks \u2014 you could pick and mix and buy them all in one place. Eventually, we prophesied, you would be able to follow friends and celebrities, find out where they got their features from, and then buy the same. Our business was beauty treatments. We allowed independent beauty professionals to upload pictures of their services to their profile, sync their calendar and take bookings from the thousands of beauty fans using our platform to document their favourite looks. We had started out with nail art, colourful braids and party make-up, but very quickly aestheticians joined the platform, and all of a sudden you could buy noses, lips, chins and a super-smooth forehead \u2014 all achieved by injectables. I had worked at this company for over a year, starting at its inception. I was 23 and for a while I was successful for my age. A bright and rising star. The trip to Spain came shortly after we had raised \u00a34 million in funding. It felt like an enactment of what we imagined venture capital backed tech companies should do, a Goop-noir parody of a Silicon Valley ideal. We slept in inflatable pods, went on self discovery hikes and filled out prompts about our childhood trauma by the pool. In this particular session, our head of people, a former VC scout, was leading a class on building better tech. Somehow, this meant imagining the worst possible outcomes for our company and trying to plan to avoid them. So there we sat, on high school plastic chairs, and took it in turns to conjure a horror story of everything we could possibly do wrong. The data could leak. The software could get hacked. We could lose everyone\u2019s bank details. When it was my turn, I prophesied that eventually, the algorithm would incite insecurities in girls en masse and encourage thousands to sculpt their faces and bodies into similarity, spending hundreds or even thousands in the process, before we changed the code and their features were out of fashion once more. I realised, after announcing my beauty Black Mirror episode to the room, that it had already started happening. We were doing tech differently \u2014 a female-founded beauty start-up taking on the San Francisco brotopia. We marketed ourselves as a company contributing to the economic empowerment of women; we had signed up to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and our pitch centred on the advancement of women and girls towards gender equality. But it is not always that simple. We were part of a $500 billion global beauty industry \u2014 one, according to Forbes, predicted to grow by more than 50 per cent by 2025. My company was one of many ventures trying to capitalise on a decade of selfie-taking and an increasing obsession with ourselves. This was a newly energised beauty industrial complex, in which body parts were designed to be easily replicated and sold to the masses. We spoke about beauty treatments as if they existed in a vacuum, as though separate from the patriarchal ideal that benefits from the time, money and energy they cost women the world over. Women, we said, in pink and purple Instagram posts, could celebrate themselves (and other women) by booking beauty treatments through our app. I thought about the girls who had volunteered themselves for the free beauty treatments and wondered how much of it was ever voluntary. I thought about making profit with women without profiting from women. I thought about my Stockholm syndrome and wondered if I was now my own captor or if I was someone else\u2019s? I thought about leaving my job and then I thought about all the free beauty treatments I\u2019d lose if I quit. John Berger famously wrote: \u2018You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting \u201cVanity\u201d, thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure.\u2019 But we added another layer: you taught a girl that beauty labour was an investment essential for her worth, that braiding and preening and plucking were necessary skills for her humanity. You told her over and over again that beauty labour is only valuable when unpaid, and when she started to profit from her beauty work you reduced her efforts to frivolity. Once the feminists saw the blood money on her hands, they pushed her out and called her a traitor. A few weeks after returning home, I quit my job.

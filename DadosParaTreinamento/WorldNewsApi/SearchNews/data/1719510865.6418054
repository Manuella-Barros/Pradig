{"id": 223708628, "title": "At least 800,000 people evacuated in Bangladesh ahead of Cyclone Remal's landfall", "text": "At least 800,000 Bangladeshis fled their coastal villages on Sunday for concrete storm shelters further inland as the low-lying nation prepared for crashing waves when a cyclone makes landfall, top government disaster officials said. Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India late on Sunday evening, with Bangladesh's weather department predicting howling gales and gusts of up to 130 kilometres per hour. The state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department said Cyclone Remal would make landfall on Sunday by midnight local time (4am AEST). Bangladesh has deployed tens of thousands of volunteers to the region to evacuate people to 4,000 cyclone shelters. But local officials said many people were staying home as they feared their property would be stolen if they left. The shelters have been set up along the country's lengthy coast on the Bay of Bengal, with the cyclone expected to hit a 220-kilometre stretch from India's Sagar Island to Khepupara in Bangladesh. Schools have been closed until further notice and India's Kolkata airport will be closed for 21 hours from midnight Sunday. Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level, warning fishermen against going to the sea and triggering an evacuation order for those in at-risk areas. \"The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet [four metres] above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous,\" senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik told AFP. High storm surges can devastate villages as most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are only one metre or two metres above sea level. Thirty-five-year-old fisherman Yusuf Fakir lives in the southern tip of Bangladesh, in the predicted route of the storm. \"We are terrified,\" he said. \"Our daily life is disrupted.\" Cyclone Remal is the first cyclone in the Bay of Bengal ahead of this year's monsoon season, which runs from June to September. Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its densely populated coast has increased sharply \u2014 from one a year to as many as three \u2014 due to the impact of climate change. The Indian Navy said it had prepared two ships equipped with aid and medical supplies to help those affected.

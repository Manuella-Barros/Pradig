In a revelation that has stunned royal enthusiasts, an interview with television producer and writer Aaron Korsch has resurfaced, disclosing that the Duchess of Sussex was prohibited by Buckingham Palace from saying 'poppycock' on screen. This directive reportedly came before Meghan's marriage to Prince Harry in 2018, during her time portraying Rachel Zane on the popular legal show. Korsch explained that the line was intended as a tribute to his wife's family. He remarked: \"My wife's family, when they have a topic to discuss that might be sensitive, they use the word 'poppycock.'\" He added: \"So, in the episode, Mike and Rachel were going to have a thing, and as a nod to my in-laws, we were going to have her say, 'My family would say poppycock.' And the Royal Family did not want her saying the word.\" Korsch believes the decision was made due to concerns that the footage could be edited to make Meghan appear to say a more offensive word. \"They didn't want to put the word 'poppycock' in her mouth,\" he said. \"I presume because they didn't want people cutting things together of her saying 'c**k.' So, we had to change it to 'bulls***.'\" The intriguing tidbit, which has recently gained traction on TikTok, has left the royal fanbase split. One commenter said: \"I think .. smart of the Royal family. The video would definitely be edited in some crazy ways.\" One supporter wrote: \"The royals aren't some celebrity family, they're the living embodiment of the British state. It's only right they consider this stuff.\" However, not everyone was in agreement. One individual commented: \"She has a sex scene in Suits so I think words like that, does it matter? No.\" Another added: \"I can see that, but at the same time it's the 21st century and it's just a word.\"", "summary": "Meghan Markle was banned from saying a peculiar British word in Suits before she officially became a member of the Royal Family, according to the show's creator", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/buckingham-palace-banned-meghan-markle-32992556", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/article32992554.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_suits.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:54:33", "author": "Lizzie McAllister", "authors": ["Lizzie McAllister"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.194}

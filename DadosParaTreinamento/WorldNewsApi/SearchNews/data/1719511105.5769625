While observers say Monday\u2019s summit is unlikely to yield significant results amid geopolitical tensions, a return to the table after 2019 is still seen as a signal of the three neighbours\u2019 interest in improving relations. China and Japan agreed to launch a new round of high-level economic dialogue as Li held his first official meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday afternoon, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported. According to Japan\u2019s Kyodo News, Kishida also asked that China lift its ban on imports of Japanese seafood. The ban, imposed last year by an angry Beijing after Japan went ahead with plans to release radioactive water from its damaged Fukushima nuclear plant, has cast a shadow over bilateral relations. Li demanded that Japan \u201cfulfil its own responsibilities and obligations\u201d on the issue, while also urging that it \u201cproperly handle the issues of history and Taiwan\u201d, according to CCTV. The Kyodo report said Kishida had mentioned the importance of a stable Taiwan Strait during his talks with Li and conveyed Tokyo\u2019s \u201cserious concern\u201d about Beijing\u2019s military expansion. His remarks came a day after the People\u2019s Liberation Army concluded two days of what observers described as the largest and closest military drills ever held near Taiwan. Beijing described the exercise as a \u201cstrong deterrent\u201d against Taiwanese independence, but both Tokyo and Washington have expressed concerns. Meeting South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol earlier in the day, Li urged Seoul to work with Beijing to \u201coppose turning economic and trade issues into political or security issues\u201d, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. He also called for joint efforts to \u201csafeguard the stability and smooth flow of the industrial chains and supply chains of the two countries and the world\u201d. Li and Yoon agreed to speed up the second phase of negotiations on a bilateral Free Trade Agreement. Li said China was willing to strengthen cooperation with South Korea in areas such as high-end manufacturing, new energy, artificial intelligence and biomedicine, Xinhua reported. He also pledged to protect foreign investment, including that of South Korean companies \u2013 something he also emphasised in a separate meeting later with Samsung Group chairman Lee Jae-yong. According to Xinhua, Yoon said South Korea would adhere to the \u201cone-China principle\u201d, which states that Taiwan is part of China. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency said Yoon called on China to play a role in the North Korean nuclear issue and Pyongyang\u2019s military cooperation with Moscow. It also said Beijing and Seoul had agreed to set up a mechanism for diplomatic and security dialogue, with the first meeting to be held next month. China is South Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and is seen as a key force in containing nuclear-armed North Korea. However, regional geopolitics has felt the effects as the United States steps up security cooperation with Japan and South Korea, both US treaty allies, amid its worsening rivalry with China. Hidden risks in Beijing\u2019s relationship with its two East Asian neighbours over Taiwan have also surfaced, as William Lai Ching-te of Taiwan\u2019s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party was sworn in as the island\u2019s new leader on Monday. Lai, whom Beijing regards as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker\u201d, has repeatedly expressed hopes for greater economic and security cooperation with Japan. Beijing has accused Lai of \u201cingratiating himself\u201d with Japan, and lodged serious representations on Monday after Japanese and South Korean politicians attended his inauguration ceremony. Beijing\u2019s envoy to Tokyo, Wu Jianghao, accused Japan of \u201chistorical responsibility\u201d over the Taiwan issue at a seminar on Saturday, urging that it \u201cbe careful in its words and actions\u201d and to uphold its \u201cserious political commitment to the one-China principle\u201d. Wu has previously drawn protests from Tokyo for similar remarks. Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, Japan and South Korea, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state. But Washington opposes any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.", "summary": "Japanese prime minister\u2019s Taiwan reference draws censure from Li, who calls on South Korea to jointly \u2018oppose turning economic and trade issues into political or security issues\u2019.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3264174/trade-taiwan-focus-chinese-premier-li-qiang-meets-leaders-japan-south-korea-ahead-3-way-summit-seoul", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/26/99e6d961-2095-4e54-bfd7-eb533387e57f_b164f08d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:00:09", "author": "Yuanyue Dang", "authors": ["Yuanyue Dang"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.052}

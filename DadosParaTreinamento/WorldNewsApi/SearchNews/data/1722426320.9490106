Performing the ground-breaking of the Abia State Renewed Hope Estate in Umuoche Bende in Bende Local Government Area, Governor Alex Chioma Otti expressed delight in Mr. President\u2019s gesture in constructing 250 housing units which will help cre-ate job opportunities, pro-mote commercial activities in the area as well as ease accommodation challenges faced by Abia residents. Governor Otti who was represented by his Deputy, Engr. Ikechukwu Lekwachi Emetu, commended the Federal Government for embarking on the project and assured of the state government\u2019s support in providing adequate securi-ty to the contractors for a seamless execution of the project. \u201cWe thank President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for this laudable project. This project will create jobs for Abians and keep our youths busy. We are trying our best to advance the ease of do-ing business in the state. \u201cWe assure you as a gov-ernment that everybody working in this very proj-ect is secured so that this project is delivered and our people take possession of this will be guaranteed,\u201d Otti said. Delivering his address, the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Arc. Ahmed Musa Dangi-wa, thanked Governor Otti for his swift approval in providing land for the project, thus, reducing the cost of the housing units for potential homeowners. He charged the developers to be committed to deliver-ing quality work as speci-fied within three months to enable Abians to purchase and take possession of the facility. The minister stated; \u201cdif-ferent options were created to enable everyone who has a source of income and live-lihood to own these homes when they are completed. These include single-digit mortgage loans that ben-eficiaries can repay over 30 years and rent-to-own schemes provided by the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, and outright pur-chase options for those who can afford to pay upfront,\u201d the minister said.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"990\" height=\"556\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Bola-Tinubu-45.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Bola-Tinubu-45.jpg 990w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Bola-Tinubu-45-300x168.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Bola-Tinubu-45-768x431.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" /></div>Abia State is set to key into the first phase of Presi\u00addent Bola Tinu\u00adbu&#8217;s larger vision of provid\u00ading 12 housing estates and three cities across the coun\u00adtry which will catalyse eco\u00adnomic growth and provide direct and indirect jobs.

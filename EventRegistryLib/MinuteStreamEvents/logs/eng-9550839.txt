At the same time, analysts will also be on the look-out for more details on the scenarios first described by Campos Neto last month in a meeting that was opened to the press at the last minute.\n\nReading from prepared notes, Campos Neto said a \"big repricing\" of assets in response to higher global rates could jeopardize Brazil's central bank plans. While less global uncertainty would allow the board to carry on with half-point cuts, high volatility would force it to pare down the easing pace, he said.\n\nTwo other scenarios -- in which the bank would have to change its balance of risks or its base-case outlook -- seemed murkier.\n\nMonetary Policy Director Gabriel Galipolo refrained from mentioning the four scenarios in his latest public speech, sparking speculation that not all board members may be in agreement. At a news conference last week, Supervision Director Ailton Aquino said a \"cautious\" stance is needed due to market volatility.\n\n\"The global scenario requires a more cautious pace,\" said Laiz Carvalho, Brazil economist at BNP Paribas. She expects a hawkish tone in the post-meeting statement and a unanimous decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. \"We could see a debate about their pace in the minutes\" to their rate decision.\n\nFiscal Woes\n\nCentral bankers could reinforce the importance of fulfilling fiscal pledges after President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government opened the door for more spending in 2025. The economic team said it will aim for a balanced primary budget -- which excludes interest payments -- instead of a surplus next year.\n\nOn top of that, devastating floods in southern Brazil are increasing spending pressure even further.\n\nMoody's Ratings raised Brazil's credit outlook to positive last week, though the decision is unlikely to change the bleak view investors have on the government's ability to shore up public accounts.\n\n\"Between signs of political fatigue on efforts to raise revenues, little will to cut expenditures and moderate growth, public debt seems poised to grow,\" JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts Cassiana Fernandez, Vinicius Moreira and Mirella Sampaio wrote in a recent research note.\n\n--With assistance from Andrew Rosati and Giovanna Serafim.\n\n(Updates number of economists surveyed and and percentage of digital options in second paragraph.)", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [],

The remaining eleven forecast a seventh straight half-point reduction.\n\nThe decision was split for the first time since August, with four of the nine board members voting for a bigger cut of 50 basis points.\n\n\"The Committee stresses that monetary policy should continue being contractionary until the consolidation of both the disinflation process and the anchoring of expectations around the targets,\" policymakers wrote in a statement accompanying the decision. \"The Committee also reinforces, with special emphasis, that the extension and adequacy of future changes in the interest rate will be determined by the firm commitment of reaching the inflation target in the relevant horizon.\"\n\nCampos Neto warned investors last month that a \"big repricing\" in international assets increased uncertainty to the point that the central bank could no longer remain committed to its guidance for an additional half-point reduction. There are risks the Federal Reserve will hold its interest rates high for longer as the US economy remains firm. Locally, the weakening of next year's key fiscal goal rekindled spending concerns among investors.\n\n\"They had made it clear their decision would be dependent on market conditions,\" Alexandre de Azara, chief economist at UBS BB Investment Bank, said before the rate decision. \"Uncertainties are high.\"\n\nAnnual inflation eased to 3.77% in mid-April, as service costs increased less than in the previous month. Still, policymakers have said they remain concerned over possible price pressures stemming from a strong labor market.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says\n\n\"Brazil's central bank abandoned its past forward guidance in favor of a smaller interest-rate cut, a move officials had hinted at in recent weeks. As we expected, the decision was split and the board opted against indicating its next moves. We expect another 25-basis-point cut in June and see upside risk to our year-end Selic forecast of 9.5%.\"\n\nThe government opened the door for more spending in 2025 by saying it will aim for a balanced primary budget -- which excludes interest payments -- instead of a surplus.\n\nInflation estimates remain above the bank's 3% goal through 2027 as investors assess changes to monetary policy driven by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's growing influence over the bank's board.

Locally, the weakening of next year's key fiscal goal rekindled spending concerns among investors.\n\nIn subsequent public appearances, directors Gabriel Galipolo and Ailton Aquino -- both of whom backed a larger cut -- refrained from reinforcing the message, sparking speculation that not all board members were in agreement.\n\nRead More: Under Lula, Doves Are Rapidly Gaining Power in the Central Bank\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nIn Wednesday's statement, central bankers removed language that they had repeatedly used to signal the size of future monetary easing.\n\nInstead, they noted that, \"with special emphasis, that the extension and adequacy of future changes in the interest rate will be determined by the firm commitment of reaching the inflation target in the relevant horizon.\"\n\nPolicymakers wrote that they are \"closely\" following recent developments in Brazil's fiscal policy. \"The Committee stresses that a credible fiscal policy, committed to debt sustainability, contributes to the anchoring of inflation expectations and to the reduction in the risk premia of financial assets, therefore impacting monetary policy,\" they wrote.\n\nThose remarks came after the government opened the door for more spending in 2025 by saying it will aim for a balanced primary budget -- which excludes interest payments -- instead of a surplus. On top of that, devastating floods in southern Brazil are now increasing pressure for outlays even further.\n\nBoard Behavior\n\nLocally, overall economic activity and the labor market have been stronger than expected, board members wrote. At the same time, the global outlook has become more adverse because of \"heightened and persistent\" doubts on when the Federal Reserve will start its own easing cycle, they wrote.\n\n\"In spite of the number of votes in favor of a half-point cut, the message of the statement was tough,\" said Tatiana Pinheiro, an economist at Galapagos Capital. \"I don't see the board accelerating the pace of cuts again at coming meetings.\"\n\nIn their statement, central bankers raised both their 2024 and 2025 inflation estimates to 3.8% and 3.3%, respectively. They also reiterated that several measures of underlying prices remain above the 3% target.\n\nAnnual inflation eased to 3.77% in mid-April, as service costs increased less than in the previous month. Still, policymakers have said they remain concerned over possible price pressures stemming from a strong labor market.\n\nAnalyst inflation estimates also remain above the bank's goal through 2027 as investors assess changes to monetary policy driven by Lula's growing influence over the bank's board.\n\nThe bank's decision on Wednesday could revive political tensions, as Lula prods his cabinet for proposals to juice economic growth while many allies continue to criticize Campos Neto for not loosening monetary policy fast enough.\n\nFor investors, it will also heighten concerns that greater changes are in store by year's end, when terms for Campos Neto and two other board members will end.\n\n\"Financial markets should now speculate over how the central bank will act starting in January with the new board composition,\" said Arthur Carvalho, chief economist at Truxt Investimentos. \"That uncertainty should raise inflation risk premia in all Brazilian assets.\"\n\n--With assistance from Giovanna Serafim.\n\n(Re-casts story, adds details from central bank statement and economist comments starting in third paragraph)", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news",

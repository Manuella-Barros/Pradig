The Department for Work and Pensions says it plans to make the disability benefits system \"fit for the future\" and overhaul the 'one size fits all' approach. A new Modernising Support Green Paper was published on April 29, following the Prime Minister's speech which set out wide-ranging proposals for welfare reform. The paper set out proposals to make changes to the eligibility criteria for PIP, so it is fairer and better targeted; reform the PIP assessment so that it is more closely linked to a person\u2019s condition and removed entirely for those most in need; and move away from a fixed cash benefit system so people can receive more tailored support in line with their needs. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: \"It's clear that our disability benefits system isn't working in the way it was intended, and we\u2019re determined to reform it to ensure it's sustainable for the future, so we can continue delivering support to those who genuinely need it most. Today's Green Paper marks the next chapter of our welfare reforms and is part of our plan to make the benefits system fairer to the taxpayer, better targeted to individual needs and harder to exploit by those who are trying to game the system.\" So how does the assessment process work at the moment? Here we take a look at the rules that are in place for deciding if people qualify for the benefit.

At present, if you struggle with everyday tasks like cooking, bathing or getting dressed, you can receive either the standard rate of PIP's daily living element at \u00a372.65 per week or the enhanced rate at \u00a3108.55. There's also a mobility component that could be either \u00a328.70 or \u00a375.75. This means the maximum weekly payment stands at \u00a3184.30. PIP is paid every four weeks so this amounts to \u00a3737.20 going into a person's account if they are among the 36 per cent of claimants to get the highest level of award. Contrary to common misconceptions, having a disability or medical condition does not automatically qualify you for the benefit. Instead, eligibility is determined by how your condition affects your daily life. To determine whether you're eligible, you must undergo a PIP assessment, Charities have voiced concerns that the PIP assessment process can be complex and stressful for applicants. However, there are measures individuals can take to increase their chances of a favourable outcome, reports the Mirror. At present, with a consultation still running on the proposed overhaul of PIP and a general election called that could see a new party in Government, the PIP claims process is unchanged. Mims Davies, DWP Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, recently confirmed: \"There will be no immediate changes to PIP, or to health assessments. All scheduled PIP assessments and payments will proceed as normal, and claimants should continue to engage as usual and provide any necessary information or updates regarding their circumstances. \"We encourage everyone to respond to the consultation which can be found here so that we are able to hear from as many disabled people, people with health conditions, their representatives, and local stakeholders as possible on these important issues.\" What is a PIP assessment? The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) uses the PIP assessment to determine your eligibility and the amount you could receive. The rate you're paid is based on whether your ability to carry out daily living or mobility activities is limited or severely limited, according to Disability Rights UK. You accumulate points when you can't safely complete a task to an acceptable standard, repeatedly, and within a reasonable time - no more than twice as long as it would take most people. To qualify for the standard rate of the daily living component, you need to score at least eight points under the 10 daily living activity headings. For the enhanced rate, you need to score at least 12 points. You don't have to be awarded points for every aspect of the assessment to receive some financial support. Before being invited to an assessment, you'll need to complete a PIP claim form. Disability Rights UK has a comprehensive guide to filling out the form. It advises going into detail about each obstacle you face and how it impacts your life - even if it seems obvious to you. You should also provide examples. According to the process, the assessor - typically a healthcare worker - uses the data you've provided on your initial PIP claim form to reach their decision and will also take into account your actions and statements during your evaluation. Assessments can be carried out in person, by phone or via video call. During the assessment, you are allowed to have someone present with you and you also have the legal right to record your PIP assessment. Here's how to get ready for a PIP assessment It is important that you prepare for your assessment, Citizens Advice says. One way to do this is by compiling all the relevant medical evidence of your condition such as doctor's notes and letters. This should also include a list of the aids or appliances you have to use, and any help you may receive - for example, if you hire someone to clean your house because you are unable to do it yourself. If you have mobility issues, such as difficulty walking, you might possess - or be eligible for - a Blue Badge from your local council. This can also serve as evidence of mobility problems. Having a copy of your PIP evidence form on hand during your assessment is recommended by Citizens Advice so that you can refer to it at any given time. If your condition changes from one day to the next, keeping a diary to illustrate what your capabilities are like over time is a good idea. What to do at the assessment During your assessment, it's crucial to detail the tasks you struggle with or can't do at all. You should also provide a comprehensive description of what a challenging day looks like for you. Remember, your assessor will use your statements and actions during the assessment to make their decision. For instance, if your PIP assessment is in person, your assessor might ask how you travelled to the assessment. If you took the bus and didn't mention any difficulties, they could infer that you can use public transport without assistance. Sometimes, you may be asked to perform physical tasks during an in-person assessment. Citizens Advice emphasises that you shouldn't feel compelled to do things you normally wouldn't be able to do. If you're unable to do something - or don't feel comfortable doing it - you should say so. This is because if you manage to do something on the day, the assessor may assume you can always do it, which could result in an unsuccessful claim. If the consultation is via phone or video call, the assessor may ask you to describe how you carry out tasks such as preparing and cooking food, getting dressed, and moving around outside your home. When responding, break down the process and guide them through how you complete tasks step-by-step to give an accurate depiction of how your disability or health condition affects you. While it might seem like a lengthy process, your response should accurately reflect how you carry out tasks - so ensure you provide a detailed explanation. In addition, discuss the emotional effect of performing a task and the potential impact on you if repeated frequently in a short span. After the assessment is completed, you will need to wait to hear if you have been awarded PIP and at what level. The Department for Work and Pensions says it has cut down the time it takes from start of your claim to reach a decision. Mims Davies, DWP Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, said \"the end-to-end claim process for new claims has been reduced from 26 weeks in August 2021 to a current wait of 15 weeks.\" Get breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp. Join our dedicated community to get the latest updates.

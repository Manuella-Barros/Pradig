I have fine hair past my waist and it\u2019s ALWAYS a nightmare after showering. I was reluctant but tried the brush because I knew if it didn\u2019t work I could return it. Not only am I not going to return I am going to order more. I was AMAZED how easy and soft this brush was and it completely worked. It normally takes me 20\u201330 minutes to detangle my hair but I was done in less than half the time. Thank you!!!!!!\" \u2014Ann S. \"Finally a brush I can use that does not break or pull out my hair! I have been using this for about a week. I use it both wet and dry. So far NO hair in the brush! Amazing! It does not hurt or pull! I wish I had found this sooner! I got the smaller handheld version for the shower. It is also awesome!\" \u2014Adrienne Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in three sizes and 21 colors).", "summary": "<h1>Your hair is delicate as heck, so stop using brushes that can snag and rip your strands and instead get one designed to ~glide.~</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/18/16/enhanced/e4c9f0f9a14a/original-493-1718728286-12.jpg?crop=1245:830;3,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicahall2/best-hair-brush-for-fine-hair\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicahall2/best-hair-brush-for-fine-hair", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/21/20/campaign_images/40535db6514f/if-you-have-fine-hair-you-probably-need-one-of-th-3-1474-1719002332-7_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:31:03", "author": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,Jessica Hall", "authors": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "Jessica Hall"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.117}

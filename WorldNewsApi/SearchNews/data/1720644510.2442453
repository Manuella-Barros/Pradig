As a lifelong Swiftie, I have only ever seen my idol once when she appeared with Haim at the O2 \u2013 but that was all about to change at Edinburgh night one. The fandom that follows the icon has been jokingly called a cult or a religion but I\u2019m not kidding when I say the whole thing felt like a religious experience. I\u2019ve always loved Taylor for her ability to articulate in song what I\u2019m feeling at various points in my life so hearing it all live was overwhelming. I\u2019m not ashamed to say I cried multiple times. The entirety of Edinburgh was buzzing as Swiftiemania took over, and merchandise could be seen everywhere. Naturally, before the Murrayfield Stadium gig started, Swifties gathered and traded friendship bracelets whenever possible. The UK leg has officially started (Picture: Getty) Metro reporter Danni Scott attended Taylor\u2019s opening night in Edinburgh While it may seem cringeworthy to some, bracelets embody the larger ethos of the show. This is not a concert for a casual fan; it\u2019s an outpouring of love from Taylor to Swifties. Finally, at 7.15 pm, the music stopped and the infamous countdown clock reached 0. The roar let out by fans was deafening \u2013 earplugs are a must for this gig. It\u2019s hard not to get swept up in the excitement of it all, even Taylor had a look of sheer delight on her face as she introduced the tour and took us through Lover. The well-documented setlist only increased excitement as fans sang along to every single lyric at an ever-increasing decibel. @l_aurenpeters Edinburgh Night 1 we\u2019re coming for you! #erastour #erastourtaylorswift #taylorswift #erastouredinburgh #erastouredinburghn1 #swifies @Danni \u266c bejeweled transition \u2013 theo (taylor\u2019s version) Exchanging friendship bracelets is a common activity among Swifites While hits like Cruel Summer and The Man serve as a crowd-pleasing warm-up, Fearless is where the set begins to shine. Nostalgia radiates from this era and left the entire stadium giddy as we belted Love Story and You Belong with Me. Red offers another indulgent nostalgia dip packed with fan favourite moments like the 22 hat and All Too Well (10 Minute Version). If you had to pick a crown jewel in Taylor\u2019s discography it would certainly be this. I expected to get bored as the track hit halfway \u2013 few artists could get away with singing a 10-minute version of a decade-old song \u2013 but it was utterly captivating. The global popstar covers 18 years and 11 albums in her concert (Picture: Getty) stop omg here is a video from the actual proposal and taylor seeing it in the background, so happy for them!! \u00f0\u009f\u0098-\u00f0\u009f\u00ab\u00b6 pic.twitter.com/kEyEWt9z8x\u2014 kaia (@kaiamal13) June 8, 2024 I barely breathed, not daring to miss a moment of the iconic track. As with any good gig, the pace ebbs and flows with dance tracks and ballads. However, if I had one (very minor) gripe with the Eras Tour, it\u2019s the astounding lack of Speak Now despite the popularity and re-release. With only Enchanted on the setlist, the era feels a little rushed. The ballad is a gorgeous moment with dancers in lilac circling the songstress in her ball gown but I wish there was more \u2013 maybe I\u2019m just being greedy. Justice for my favourite album. Dotted throughout the show were moments when you realise how much this all means to Taylor. From her repeated \u2018thank you\u2019s to drinking in the thunderous applause after Champagne Problems, she just adores her fans. \u2018The entire show is an epic production\u2019 (Picture: Jane Barlow/PA Wire) Yes, she\u2019s a capitalist queen. But beneath that is a genuine glee when she hears us all singing along. During folklore, she paused the show to ask if a couple had just got engaged. Congratulating them, Taylor explained that she loves daylight shows because \u2018at night it\u2019s dark\u2019, before giggling realising the obviousness of her remark. These interactions humanised her and showed an endearing side to this music titan. Despite the stadium filled with over 70,000 Swifties, she still managed to make every single person feel seen. Three and a half hours flew by as Reputation picked up the pace once again, a fan favourite and the likely next era to get its Taylor\u2019s Version. It is a three-and-a-half hour extravaganza (Picture: Getty) Taylor lets loose here, belting some incredible notes and taking a playful tone over scathing lyrics about those who have wronged her. I\u2019d be remiss not to mention the Tortured Poets Department. This new era was what I was most excited to see, considering it is fast becoming one of my favourite albums. While the entire show is an epic production, Taylor really excelled here with alien abductions, gliding staging, and flawless vocals. To say Smallest Man destroyed myself and every other swiftie in my eye-line would be an understatement. The concert came to a climactic end (Picture: Getty) Ultimately, the Eras Tour is complex, delicate, and epic. If you don\u2019t like Taylor Swift, this is not going to be the moment you suddenly start liking her but that\u2019s fine, this wasn\u2019t designed to introduce people to her latest album. This is for the fans and for those of us who have had our entire lives soundtracked by Taylor, this is as good as it gets. I\u2019d do it all over again in a heartbeat, every single night. Take us to church, Taylor. Oh and if anyone is wondering, the surprise song mash-up of Would\u2019ve Could\u2019ve Should\u2019ve and I Know Places was as unbelievable as you\u2019d expect. I need at least three weeks to process it. Got a story?

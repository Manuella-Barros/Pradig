Another group calling for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, SJ for Gaza posted about the student walkout while calling for a peaceful rally with no hate speech.\n\nSJ for Gaza did not return an email Wednesday morning with questions about the event and their connection to the student walkout.\n\n\"Student leadership at Eastern held a conference this morning, Wednesday, April 24, 2024, with the principal and vice principals to discuss concerns about the event planned for this Friday, April 26, 2024,\" Superintendent Robert S. Cloutier said in a statement to NJ Advance Media. \"Students agreed to cancel this week's event in order to meet together and plan a united rally in support of basic human rights for the innocent people on both sides of the conflict. That convening is tentatively scheduled for Monday, May 20, 2024.\"\n\nEastern Camden County Regional School Board president Jude J. Brown did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe changes to the event came after local officials voiced opposition to the students' plan.\n\nThe walkout was scheduled during the Jewish passover holiday from April 22 through April 30, which was particularly upsetting to Voorhees councilman and deputy mayor Jason Ravitz, who posted several statements to his personal Facebook page objecting to the event.\n\n\"My biggest issue is that it's happening over the jewish holiday of Passover,\" Ravitz said on a phone call Tuesday night. \"If Jewish students were planning a walkout on any other religious holiday, I would stop it.\"\n\nRavitz did not immediately return a a phone call Wednesday after the school district announced the event would be postponed.\n\nRavitz said Tuesday that he received a call from one of the student organizers who wanted to schedule a meeting to discuss the walkout, but further dialogue was cut off after the student declined to reschedule the walkout after Passover. Ravitz also acknowledged that he is a fierce advocate for state of Israel and pointed to his long history of social media posts as evidence.\n\nVoorhees Township Committee also posted a message on its website objecting to the walkout, alleging the demonstration was a response to a student's decision to enlist in the Israeli Defense Force after graduation.\n\n\"We have recently become aware of antisemitic incidents occurring at Eastern Regional High School, notably in regard to a student's courageous decision to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces upon graduation,\" the statement from the township committee said. \"Township Committee respects our students' choices and beliefs and while we acknowledge and respect that our community holds vast and differing opinions on the conflict, harassment, threats, and antisemitism may never be tolerated.\"\n\nThe district did not address whether the walkout was in response to this student's decision and whether there has been an increase in antisemitic behavior at Eastern Regional High School in its statement. Eastern Regional High School enrolls just over 1,900 students in grades nine through 12, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. It does not list student religious affiliations.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-profit, recently released a report that hate crimes of all sorts are on the rise in New Jersey, with antisemitic and anti-muslim attacks soaring.\n\nAn independent survey of just over 2,000 people in South Jersey counties from the Jewish Federation of Southern Jersey in 2014 noted that Voorhees had at least 352 people that identified as Jewish, one of the more dense enclaves in Camden County. Eastern Regional High School's calendar notes several early dismissals and days off in recognition of Jewish holidays, including Passover, Rosh Hoshana and Yom Kippur.\n\n\"Needless to say I'm thrilled that the school has canceled the event,\" Camden County Commissioner Jeff Nash said Wednesday. \"I'm extremely happy that the students worked this out together to cancel an event that was filled with hate and instead hold a peace rally.\"\n\nNash and fellow commissioner Melinda Kane wrote a blistering letter to school officials Tuesday calling for administrators to shut down the walkout.\n\n\"We are outraged by the decision of Eastern High School to permit a \"Pro-Palestinian\" walkout during school hours and call upon you to cancel this event,\" Nash and Kane wrote in the letter to the superintendent Tuesday.\n\n\"The student walkout is an intentional effort to create a hostile and isolating environment for Jewish students, the majority of whom support Israel as an integral part of their identify,\" the letter continued.\n\nThe letter cites \"misguided decisions\" by administrators at some of the nation's top universities such as the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard, who were publicly scolded during congressional hearings about hate speech on their campuses. The letter and walkout also follow closely with protests at Columbia, Yale, New York University and many other universities around the country where students are protesting for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe latest war between Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza strip, began after Hamas terrorists killed over 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, and took hostages, many of whom are still being held. Protests against Israel's response began soon after the Israeli army retaliated and reduced most of Gaza to rubble, killing an estimated 30,000 civilians, according to Gaza's health ministry, which is considered to publish the most accurate account of the death toll.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is going to cost taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nVoorhees police Capt. Carmen Del Palazzo told New Jersey 101.5 that his department is prepared for whatever happens on Friday.\n\n\"We're going to have extra officers working to basically make sure there's no breach of the peace and maintain security out there. That's the goal. We have to provide the security for the students,\" Del Palazzo said.\n\nIf the crowd grows and others try attend the department has options including closing the roads around the school, according to Del Palazzo. Parking along the road is already not allowed.\n\n\"We're just hoping that people be respectful and that they listen to the police and there's no issues. and the kids can get back in back to school and learning, Del Palazzo said.\n\nCloutier on Wednesday morning did not respond to New Jersey 101.5's request for more information about the walkout.\n\nStudents from Berlin Borough, Gibbsboro and Voorhees Township attend the high school.

We were not a part of that conversation,\" says Ash Tavares, who is a junior at Eastern Regional High. \"I think it is silencing and I think it is unfair.\"\n\nTavares says the district allowed a walkout in October after Hamas' initial attack on Israel.\n\nBut this latest walkout, originally slated for around 30 minutes during students' lunch period, drew concern from some in the community, as large protests over the conflict in Gaza happen across the country. Despite internal discussions over the walkout for some time, school officials really only saw backlash when the event became public on social media.\n\n\"It was discussed before that, but when it hit social media is when it started to take on different perspectives, let's say,\" Cloutier said.\n\nCamden County Commissioner Jeff Nash wrote a letter to Cloutier this week, calling on him to cancel the walkout.\n\n\"I felt that the school should not endorse a walkout that would put students in fear, because they are, in essence, antisemitic protests,\" Nash said.\n\nBut students who supported the protest say that was never their intention.\n\n\"We have absolutely nothing against Judaism, we have absolutely nothing against Israel, we have absolutely nothing against anyone. We are simply respecting the people that were killed, innocent lives lost,\" Tavares said.\n\nSchool officials credited students for coming up with the change to a peace rally, now tentatively scheduled for May 20 during students' lunch hour. Nash said he was pleased to hear of the change.\n\n\"That is a meaningful walkout. That is a meaningful coming together,\" Nash said.\n\nBut some students who backed the walkout say they'll move forward as planned on Friday.\n\n\"We're going to walk out,\" Tavares said. \"I expect consequences to happen, but I fully am OK with it.\"\n\nCloutier says even though the walkout has been officially canceled because it became so public online, the district will have additional police personnel around campus on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voorhees_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voorhees Township, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Voorhees Township, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Regional_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Regional High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/24/887d0b60-30cb-4621-8a30-210bdd2cf7e8/thumbnail/1200x630/279b66f21d4bc73492c45ea69fbcdb92/18pkg-ds-eastern-reg-high-protest-controversy-transfer-frame-405.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510438", "eventUri": "eng-9510438", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2179, "textEnd": 2185}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

It's expected to last about 30 minutes during a lunch period, according to event organizers.\n\nPosters advertising the walkout say it's been school-approved. Organizers like Youssef Bahnasi, a high school senior, said it took a lot of effort to gain that status.\n\n\"I think the community pressures, in some ways, the school and you know the school gave us some push back,\" said Bahnasi.\n\nHe went on to say that hate speech or hateful actions of any kind will not be tolerated, and a dress code is in place for the walkout.\n\n\"We definitely placed a very clear red line on what students can and can't do,\" Bahnasi noted.\n\nBack in October, soon after Hamas attacked Israel, students at Eastern Regional staged a walkout in memory of those who died. Bahnasi told Action News that event faced much less scrutiny.\n\nNow, pushback has come from parents and even elected officials like Camden County Commissioner Jeff Nash.\n\nNash was one of two commissioners to send a letter to the school district Tuesday, saying they are outraged that Friday's walkout is being permitted.\n\nThe letter read in part, \"The student walkout is an intentional effort to create a hostile and isolating environment for Jewish students, the majority of whom support Israel as an integral part of their identity.

The flyer for the event includes the term \"viva Palestina\" with no Israeli representation.\n\nThe Instagram account for the walk-out said the event was canceled \"since the school was under immense pressure from the Zionists.\"\n\nTavares said despite the risk of consequences, he and the other organizers will still walk out Friday as planned.\n\nVoorhees police said they will have extra patrols around the high school on Friday.\n\nCloutier did not respond to questions about the meeting with students about the walkout including who was at the meeting.", "source": {"uri": "nj1015.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Jersey 101.5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_alexander@nj1015.com", "name": "Dan Alexander", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Regional_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Regional High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KYW-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KYW-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish holidays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voorhees_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voorhees Township, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Voorhees Township, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WKXW", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WKXW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary education in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/385/files/2024/04/attachment-eastern-HS-3B.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510438", "eventUri": "eng-9510438", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He was a two-time All-American outfielder at Loyola Marymount, leading the team to the NCAA Men's College World Series in 1986.\n\nBean wrote a book titled \"Going the Other Way\" and was also a keynote speaker at many events. He publicly came out as gay in 1999, the second former major leaguer to do so after Glenn Burke.\n\nBean joined the commissioner's office in 2014, when he was hired by former Commissioner Bud Selig to be MLB's first Ambassador for Inclusion. He spent more than 10 years working for MLB, eventually being promoted to senior vice president.\n\nBean worked with MLB clubs to \"advance equality for all players, coaches, managers, umpires, employees, and stakeholders throughout baseball to ensure an equitable, inclusive, and supportive workplace for everyone.\"\n\n\"Our hearts are broken today as we mourn our dear friend and colleague, Billy Bean, one of the kindest and most respected individuals I have ever known,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Billy was a friend to countless people across our game, and he made a difference through his constant dedication to others.\"", "source": {"uri": "keyt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChannel 3-12"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@keyt.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bean", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loyola Marymount Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Selig", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Selig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://keyt.b-cdn.net/2023/08/nc312-combined-commercial-slate-860x484.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796243", "eventUri": "eng-9796243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

He was 60.\n\nThe MLB Commissioner's Office announced Bean's death in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. Bean had been serving as MLB's Senior Vice President for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion and Special Assistant to the Commissioner. The role was the latest in a second act that increased the visibility of LGBTQ issues in the sport and delivered education initiatives to players and front offices throughout the game.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken today as we mourn our dear friend and colleague, Billy Bean, one of the kindest and most respected individuals I have ever known,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Billy was a friend to countless people across our game, and he made a difference through his constant dedication to others. He made Baseball a better institution, both on and off the field, by the power of his example, his empathy, his communication skills, his deep relationships inside and outside our sport, and his commitment to doing the right thing.\"\n\nBean first joined the commissioner's office in 2014, when he was hired by then-commissioner Bud Selig to be MLB's first ever Ambassador for Inclusion, a role that included other diversity initiatives. One of the main goals of the hiring was to confront the homophobia that persisted in MLB clubhouses.\n\nBean came out publicly to the Miami Herald in 1999, four years after appearing in his last game for the San Diego Padres. He was believed to be the second MLB player to come out as gay after their playing career, following Glenn Burke of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He first revealed the news in an indirect fashion in a newspaper story about a restaurant he was opening with his partner at the time. When the story was seen by reporters, it drew national headlines.\n\nBean played in the major leagues from 1987 to 1995. He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1986 draft out of Loyola Marymount University. He debuted with the club in 1987 and played parts of three seasons before being traded to the Dodgers in 1989.\n\nHe finished his career as a .226 career hitter across 272 games for the Tigers, Dodgers and Padres. He kept his sexual orientation a secret during his playing career.\n\n\"'For nine years,\" Bean told The New York Times in 1999, \"I felt as though I had one foot in the major leagues and one on a banana peel.\"\n\nIn a later interview with the Miami Herald that same year, Bean said many former teammates were supportive once he came out publicly.\n\n\"When I talked to people like Brad (Ausmus) or Trevor Hoffman, it wasn't like, 'I can't believe you told everybody -- what exactly do you do in bed?' It was like, 'Next time you're back on the West Coast, let's go surfing again.\"\n\nIn 2003, Bean published the book \"Going the Other Way: Lessons from a Life in and out of Major-League Baseball,\" which told the story of his decision to leave baseball in 1995. He later became a public speaker, sharing his story to groups in and out of sports. Before professional baseball, Bean was a two-time All-American at Loyola Marymount. The MLB commissioner's office statement said he was the valedictorian of his graduating class at Santa Ana High School.\n\n\"We are forever grateful for the enduring impact that Billy made on the game he loved, and we will never forget him,\" Manfred said. \"On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Billy's husband, Greg Baker, and their entire family.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rustin_dodd@nytimes.com", "name": "Rustin Dodd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bean", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acute myeloid leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Selig", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bud Selig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Ana High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Hoffman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Hoffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valedictorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loyola Marymount University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/08/06184856/USATSI_20905736-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796243", "eventUri": "eng-9796243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

He spent the past decade working with teams on player education, LGBTQ inclusion and social justice initiatives.\n\nNot to be confused with longtime Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, Bean was a trailblazer as both a player and executive.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers selected Bean out of LMU in the fourth round of the 1986 MLB Draft. He made it to the big leagues in 1987, was actually teammates with Beane in 1988, and was eventually traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1989.\n\nFollowing two seasons buried in the minors, Bean joined the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. That reignited Bean's career, as he was able to return stateside and play for the San Diego Padres from 1993 to 1995.\n\nTragedy struck when Bean's wife, Sam, died of HIV-related causes in 1995. Bean then came out to his parents as gay in 1996, and he came out publicly in 1999.\n\nBean was only the second MLB player ever to publicly come out as gay, following in the footsteps of Dodgers and Athletics outfielder Glenn Burke, who played from 1976 to 1979.\n\nBean appeared in 148 MLB games across six seasons, racking up 66 hits, three home runs, 29 RBI and five stolen bases. He posted a .219 batting average, .542 OPS and -1.6 WAR before retiring.\n\nThe impact Bean made off the field was perhaps more notable, though, providing unprecedented counsel and guidance throughout every level of the sport. Manfred and Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo were among those to express their grief on social media Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken today as we mourn our dear friend and colleague, Billy Bean, one of the kindest and most respected individuals I have ever known,\" Manfred said in a statement. \"Billy was a friend to countless people across our game, and he made a difference through his constant dedication to others.

MLB announced he died Tuesday, after a year-long battle with leukemia.\n\nBean played parts of six seasons in the major leagues, including 45 games over three seasons with Detroit from 1987-89, but made his biggest impact on the game after retirement, when he came out as gay in 1999.\n\nHe was the second former major-leaguer ever to come out, after Glenn Burke.\n\nIn 2014, after a career in real estate, Bean joined MLB as its first ambassador for inclusion. In 2016, he was named the league's senior vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion, a position he held until his death. He was a special assistant to commissioner Rob Manfred.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken today as we mourn our dear friend and colleague, Billy Bean, one of the kindest and most respected individuals I have ever known,\" Manfred said in a statement released by MLB on Tuesday afternoon. \"Billy was a friend to countless people across our game, and he made a difference through his constant dedication to others.\n\n\"He made baseball a better institution, both on and off the field, by the power of his example, his empathy, his communication skills, his deep relationships inside and outside our sport, and his commitment to doing the right thing. We are forever grateful for the enduring impact that Billy made on the game he loved, and we will never forget him.\n\n\"On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Billy's husband, Greg Baker, and their entire family.\"\n\nBean, a California native, was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 24th round of the 1985 MLB Draft, but returned to Loyola Marymount for his senior season, and led the program to the College World Series.\n\nThe Tigers drafted him in the fourth round in 1986, and he debuted in left field at Tiger Stadium in Detroit on April 25, 1987. At the plate, he collected four hits, including two doubles, in a 13-2 win over the Kansas City Royals. Bean had two more hits the next day, and was a regular in the starting lineup for most of the month of May, before he was demoted to Triple-A Toledo when the bat cooled off.\n\nBean played most of the 1987-89 seasons at Toledo -- including 1988 with another Billy Beane (different spelling of the last name), who went on to become a trend-setting general manager and remains an adviser in the Oakland A's front office -- before the Tigers traded Bean to the Los Angeles Dodgers in July 1989.\n\nBean played 51 games for the 1989 Dodgers before spending the next few seasons in the minor leagues (and briefly in Japan), finally getting back to the big leagues with the San Diego Padres in 1993-95, playing mostly in the majors in 1993-94, and mostly in Triple A in 1995.\n\nWith the Padres, Bean was a roommate of future Tigers player and manager Brad Ausmus. They first met in the Wrigley Field clubhouse in Chicago, and hit it off right away as two college graduates in an era where they weren't many college grads in MLB. The two became good friends then, and were good friends again in recent years, losing touch in the middle, in the later 1990s. In an interview with The News in 2015, Ausmus, then managing the Tigers, said he only learned Bean was gay when he read it in the newspaper in 1999.\n\n\"I didn't know, but at the same time, I wasn't shocked,\" Ausmus told The News in 2015. \"I didn't care. I don't mean that in an uncaring way. He was still Billy Bean, the good friend.\"\n\nLater in Bean's MLB career, he was dealing privately with being gay. His longtime partner died during his final major-league season, and Bean, not out, didn't attend the funeral.\n\nHe came out to his parents in 1996, and then did an interview with the Miami Herald in 1999 in which he came out publicly. The story made headlines across the country.\n\nFor his major-league career, Bean played in 272 games, had five home runs and 53 RBIs, and batted .226/.266/.308. Nearly two decades after his MLB career ended, baseball brought him back, to lead the efforts of inclusion in the sport. He was hired into his first MLB role by then-commissioner Bud Selig, and promoted to a newer, more-visible role by Manfred.\n\nNow, 29 of the 30 MLB teams hold an annual \"Pride Night\" at the ballpark. The only one that doesn't is the Texas Rangers.\n\nBean also served on the MLB owners' DE&I committee, and helped develop MLB's anti-bullying education program and advocated for mental-health resources. He wrote a book, \"Going the Other Way,\" that was released in 2003, and in 2015, he was the subject of an MLB Network documentary hosted by Bob Costas.\n\n\"The Tigers organization extends its deepest condolences to the family and friends of Billy Bean, who made his major-league debut with the Tigers in 1987 and spent three seasons wearing the Olde English 'D,'\" the Tigers said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nThe Tigers were one of the teams that added a formal \"Pride Night\" during Bean's tenure.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit

He came out as gay after retiring as a player, and became a vocal advocate for athletes in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nPrimarily an outfielder in his career with the Dodgers, Detroit Tigers (1987-89), and San Diego Padres (1993-95), Beane hit .226 with five home runs and 53 RBIs in 272 games.\n\nWith the Dodgers, he hit .197/.250/.254 while seeing time at all three outfield positions after finishing the 1989 season in Los Angeles.

I'd go back in a minute. I only wish that I hadn't felt so alone, that I could have told someone, and that I hadn't always felt God was going to strike me dead.\"\n\nIn a 2015 interview, he said the sport had become a more inclusive place since his retirement.\n\n\"The players for the first time are seeing a different ideology then when I was playing,\" Bean told the Los Angeles Daily News. \"When I was playing, the other players talked about gays and lesbians, it wasn't something you would put in public press.\"\n\nIn 2000, for example, Dodger Stadium security guards asked a lesbian couple to leave the park in response to a fan's complaint that the two had kissed after a home run. The team issued a public apology to the couple and donated 5,000 tickets to gay and lesbian organizations.\n\nToday, 29 of the 30 MLB teams celebrate some version of a \"Pride Night\" to welcome the LGBTQ+ community to the ballpark.\n\nBean joined MLB's front office July 14, 2014, first as then-Commissioner Bud Selig's Ambassador for Inclusion. As a senior advisor to Commissioner Manfred, Bean's role focused on player education, LGBTQ inclusion, and social justice initiatives, according to MLB's release.\n\nBefore he was drafted by the New York Yankees in 1985, and the Tigers in 1986, Bean was a two-time All-American outfielder at Loyola Marymount University. According to MLB, he graduated from LMU with a degree in Business Administration, and the valedictorian of his graduating class at Santa Ana High School.\n\nPhoto Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHave you subscribed to our YouTube Channel yet?

Of course, he was a player for the Tigers. He also played with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres.\n\nHere is a part of the post that Major League Baseball made in honor of Bean:\n\n\"Over the last 10 years, Billy worked passionately and tirelessly with MLB and all 30 Clubs, focusing on player education, LGBTQ inclusion, and social justice initiatives to advance equality in the game for all. Billy's 10-year playing career included six Major League seasons with the Tigers, Dodgers, and Padres. Commissioner Rob Manfred called Billy 'one of the kindest and most respected individuals I have ever known\" and someone who \"made Baseball a better institution, both on and off the field.'\"\n\nBean was Detroit's fourth-round pick in the 1986 MLB Draft. He was the only living Major League Baseball player who was openly gay.\n\nHis retirement came early at just 31 years of age. The reason for his early retirement was due to not wanting to be a closeted baseball player any longer. He didn't think that baseball was ready to welcome an openly gay player at that point in time.\n\nThree years later, he came out as gay. He was just the second professional baseball player to ever come out.\n\nOur prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time. Bean was a true hero for his stances and drive to help bring equality and diversity to the world.

We are forever grateful for the enduring impact that Billy made on the game he loved, and we will never forget him. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Billy's husband, Greg Baker, and their entire family.\"\n\nBean was first drafted by the Yankees back in 1985 in the 24th round, though he opted to return to Loyola Marymount University for his senior year and join the Lions for their participation in the College World Series rather than sign. He eventually landed with the Tigers after they selected him in the fourth round of the following year's draft before making his big league debut in 1987 at the age of 23. Bean played for the Tigers until 1989 in an up-and-down role shuttling between the big leagues and the minors. He made just 97 plate appearances with the Tigers over his years in the organization but got a more robust opportunity after being traded to the Dodgers in July of 1989. He appeared in 51 games with L.A. down the stretch, though he hit just .197/.250/.254 during that time.\n\nThat would be Bean's last MLB action for a few years. He put up solid numbers for the Dodgers in the minor leagues during the 1990 and 1991 seasons before splitting the 1992 season between the Angels' minor league system and the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. Bean returned to the majors with the Padres in 1993 and enjoyed the best season of his big league career, slashing .260/.284/.395 while slugging five home runs and stealing two bases in 192 trips to the plate. He remained with San Diego through his retirement in 1995. Following the end of his playing career, Bean followed in the footsteps of former Dodgers and A's outfielder Glenn Burke in 1999 to become just the second MLB played in history to publicly come out as gay. In an interview with Robert Lipsyte of the New York Times from that year, Bean discussed his life in baseball, the decision to remain in the closet throughout his time as a professional player, and his eventual decision to come out publicly.\n\nAfter playing 272 games in the majors with three organizations across six years, Bean returned to baseball in 2014 when he was appointed as the league's first ever ambassador for inclusion by then-commissioner Bud Selig. He continued to serve in the commissioner's office under Rob Manfred and was eventually promoted to the senior vice president role he held until his death. In his role with the league, Bean worked with all 30 organizations and is credited with instrumental roles in developing education programs and expanding mental health resources available to players all across affiliated ball.\n\nWe at MLBTR join the rest of the baseball world in extending our condolences to Bean's family, former teammates and colleagues, countless friends around the game and all those mourning his passing.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_deeds@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Nick Deeds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bean", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acute myeloid leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billy Beane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loyola Marymount University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Selig", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Selig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_Kintetsu_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Professional_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nippon Professional Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2024/08/USATSI_20905735-1024x742.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796243", "eventUri": "eng-9796243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

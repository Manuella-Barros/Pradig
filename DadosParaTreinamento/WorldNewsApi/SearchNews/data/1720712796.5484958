Advocates mental health act implementation in Nigeria PORT HARCOURT \u2013 A non governmental organisation, Mandate Health Empowerment Initiative has launched an investigation into the prevalence of depression among youths not in education, employment or training, better referred to as NEET, between the ages of 18 to 24 years. The group in partnership with local and international academics and tertiary institutions, seek to understand the challenges faced by the youths and to proffer solutions. The lead researcher, Professor Linda Theron from the University of Pretoria, alongside the Nigeria focal lead, Dr. Zainab Mai-Borun from the University of Leicester, sought to identify depression resilience enablers that could mitigate the risk of depression among the youths in the oil rich region. Addressing a press conference over the weekend, the founder and president of The Mandate Health Empowerment Initiative and convener of the Association of Mental Health Reforms and Care Organisations in Africa AMHROA Network, Mr. Zion Ameh Abba, said the study was apt as over 60 per cent of Africa\u2019s population were below the age of 25. Abba, stressed that the energy, creativity and adaptability of the youths were crucial for driving economic activities, as well as fostering sustainable development as the youths constitutes a substantial portion of the continent\u2019s labour force. He said, \u201cWe are gathered here today to shed light on a critical issue affecting African youths in the Niger Delta region in Niger and South Africa, the prevalence of depression among those who find themselves not in education, employment or training, commonly referred to as NEET is critical and demands urgent attention. \u201cOur research endeavors to delve into this pressing concern and explore effective strategies to protect and support those vulnerable individuals against the debilitating effects of depression.\u201d Abba noted that while 600 youths were being recruited for the study in Rivers and Bayelsa states respectively, another 1000 youths are participating in South Africa, adding that the findings of the study would underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to address mental health disparities among youths. \u201cThe study employed a mixed method approach, combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews and focus group discussions. This comprehensive methodology allowed us to gain a nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to depression among NEET youths and to explore potential resilience-building interventions. \u201cA total of 600 youths from Rivers and Bayelsa states are currently being recruited carefully from across the LGAs in the states, who will actively be the participants in the study in Nigeria. Also, another 1000 youth participants in South Africa. \u201cOur findings will underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to address mental health disparities among this demographic. Furthermore, the study will identify several resilience-enablers that employ a different impact on the mental well-being of NEET youths.\u201d Abba while advocating the adoption and operationalisation of the mental health Act 2021 across the Niger Delta and Nigerian at large, sought the collaborations and support of government\u2019s health institutions, media, NGOs, youth councils, traditional and religious leaders, community based organisation in life cycle of the study and afterwards. \u201cThe implications of the research extend beyond academia, with significant implications for policy and practice. Informed by our findings, we will be advocating to the executive, legislative, judiciary and non state actors for the development and implementation of holistic interventions that address the intersection challenges faced by NEET youth in the Niger Delta region, especially the mental health Act 2021 adoption and operationalisation across Niger Delta and other Nigerian states. \u201cWe are specifically calling for collaborations between government\u2019s health institutions, media, NGOs, youth councils, traditional and religious leaders, community based organisation to recruitment of youth participants and implementing multisystemic resilience building initiatives all through the life cycle of the study and afterwards.\u201d", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0059.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0059.jpg 1024w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0059-300x142.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0059-768x364.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></div>.

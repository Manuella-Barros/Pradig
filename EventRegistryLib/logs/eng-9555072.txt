Fed traders slightly amped up their policy-easing bets for 2024. In the Treasury market, shorter maturities -- which are more sensitive to imminent policy moves -- outperformed.\n\n\"Time will tell whether it's a one-off or part of a genuine cooldown in the labor market,\" said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. \"Investors may have adjusted to the idea of the Fed waiting until September to cut interest rates, but that doesn't mean they're comfortable waiting indefinitely.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 extended this month's gains. Two-year yields dropped two basis points to 4.8%. Longer-dated bonds saw small losses ahead of a $25 billion sale of 30-year securities.\n\nThe pound wavered after the Bank of England sent its clearest signal yet that it was closing in on interest rate cuts, with Governor Andrew Bailey indicating markets were underpricing the pace of easing in the months ahead.\n\nThe S&P 500 already is beyond the average Wall Street forecast for year-end 2024, so investors understandably are wondering how much more room there is to run. For Leuthold Group's Doug Ramsey, another 10% gain isn't out of the question, at least statistically.\n\nHe analyzed 80 years of historical data on bull-market rallies, focusing on those that happened when unemployment was this low -- below 4% -- and the economic cycle this mature. Ramsey zoomed in on two periods that met those criteria -- one when the S&P 500 posted its longest bull-market advance, the other when it clocked the biggest gain. The former came in a 26-month advance during the 1960s, while the latter was a 60% rally leading into the dot-com bust at the turn of the century.\n\nIf the current rally meets the prior records for length and height, the S&P 500 ends the year at 5,705.\n\nThe US equity benchmark has staged a rebound in May, and is now within 1% of its all-time high.\n\n\"Our sense is that the rebound has been unloved, largely because economic surprises have turned modestly negative, and we believe this is likely to lead to additional near-term upside,\" said Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research. \"Looking out to year end, we expect to remain constructive on the outlook.\"\n\nThat would be the case, Senyek noted, unless the economy shows signs of spilling into recession, or inflation is sticky enough that the market starts to price in a Fed hike.\n\n\"Neither are part of our base case!\" Senyek concluded.\n\nFed officials are keeping a close eye on labor demand and wage growth as they debate when it might be appropriate to lower interest rates. Data Friday showed US employers scaled back hiring in April and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose, suggesting some cooling is underway in the labor market after a strong start to the year.\n\nBlackstone Inc. President Jon Gray said economic growth will slow as stubborn inflation weighs on the Fed's ability to begin lowering borrowing costs.\n\n\"We see a deceleration of growth,\" Gray said at the Macquarie Australia Conference in Sydney. \"Central banks will be slow on the cutting of rates, because they don't want to see a rise of inflation,\" he said. \"The Fed will be patient, they'll have the opportunity to cut once this year,\" he added.\n\nIf the economy is slowing, unemployment rising, inflation receding, and the Fed is expected to cut rates, there will be plenty of buyers for US Treasury notes and bonds, according to Joe Kalish at Ned Davis Research.\n\n\"But make no mistake. When conditions change, prices can change too - and quickly!\"\n\nKalish noted that the buyers of bonds today are different from the buyers of bonds during the quantitative-easing era.

The Nasdaq 100 index rose 0.2%.\n\nTreasuries also advanced, unwinding selling from the prior session, to place the 10-year yield four basis points lower at 4.45%. A $25 billion sale of 30-year bonds saw good demand, underscoring investor support for US debt.\n\nInitial applications for US unemployment benefits increased last week to the highest level since August, topping estimates, with cooling in the jobs market supporting the case for interest rate cuts. Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said rates are currently restraining the economy, but it may take \"more time\" to return inflation to their goal.\n\n\"Time will tell whether it's a one-off or part of a genuine cooldown in the labor market,\" said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. \"Investors may have adjusted to the idea of the Fed waiting until September to cut interest rates, but that doesn't mean they're comfortable waiting indefinitely.\"\n\nLower yields weakened the dollar, but the greenback's move failed to lift the yen. The Japanese currency traded flat Thursday and was little changed in early Friday trading at around 155 per dollar.\n\nInstead, emerging market currencies were among the beneficiaries of a weaker dollar. The pound also rose, despite growing confidence the Bank of England may soon begin loosening policy.\n\nData set for release in Asia Friday includes household spending and current account balance figures for Japan, industrial output for India, and the first-quarter current account balance for China. New loans and money supply data for China may also be released as early as today.\n\nOil gained for a second day on Thursday as key technical levels provided a floor for losses while investors digested a mixed US inventories report. Gold jumped more than 1% to $2,346 per ounce on Thursday.\n\nUS Rebound\n\nTo Doug Ramsey at Leuthold, another 10% gain in the S&P 500 isn't out of the question, at least statistically. He analyzed 80 years of data on bull-market rallies, focusing on those that happened when unemployment was this low and the economic cycle this mature. If the current rally meets the prior records for length and height, the S&P 500 would end the year at 5,705.\n\nApple Inc.'s stock climbed as Bloomberg News reported the company will deliver some of its upcoming artificial-intelligence features this year via data centers equipped with its own in-house processors. Nvidia Corp. led losses in chipmakers.\n\nBlackstone Inc. President Jon Gray said economic growth will slow as stubborn inflation weighs on the Fed's ability to begin lowering borrowing costs.\n\n\"We see a deceleration of growth,\" Gray said at the Macquarie Australia Conference in Sydney on Thursday. \"Central banks will be slow on the cutting of rates, because they don't want to see a rise of inflation,\" he said. \"The Fed will be patient, they'll have the opportunity to cut once this year,\" he added.\n\nIf the economy is slowing, unemployment rising, inflation receding, and the Fed is expected to cut rates, there will be plenty of buyers for US Treasury notes and bonds, according to Joe Kalish at Ned Davis Research.\n\n\"But make no mistake.

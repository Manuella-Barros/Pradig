Thankfully, there are cooling options for key sleep products, including sheets, blankets and mattresses. A cooling mattress topper, in particular, can help with not only cooling but also getting more life out of your mattress, because it can change the firmness or feel of your current setup. In the mattress industry, brands will advertise innovative cooling properties that banish heat from your bed. The reality is that not all cooling products actually work as advertised. Many only regulate heat without actually cooling you off. We tested the best cooling mattress toppers so you don't have to. We paid close attention to materials, thickness, feel, firmness and overall value. These are the ones that stood out the most. Let's dig into our favorite picks.

Best cooling mattress toppers and pads for 2024 How we test the best cooling mattress toppers We chose the best cooling mattress toppers for this list the only way you can, by testing them. We approached testing cooling mattress toppers like we test mattresses, considering performance, pricing and warranty. We assessed the toppers on key factors like firmness, feel and cooling performance when working with them. Firmness and feel We all have preferences when it comes to our beds, and the industry has done a great job of making sure that a wide range of options are available to you. However, this means there will be plenty of mattresses and toppers out there that won't suit your needs. Firmness and feel are the two main things you must remember when shopping for mattresses. Firmness is a measure of how hard or soft your mattress is. A lot of this is a preference, but some of it relies on your sleep position. Back and stomach sleepers generally need a firmer mattress, while side or combination sleepers tend to value the pressure relief that a softer mattress topper offers. How your mattress topper feels is another crucial factor. They're all comfortable, but you won't feel the same when lying down on them. Some have the traditional stuck-in-the-mud memory foam feel, while others boast a neutral foam feel that's more like a cloud. Both firmness and feel are highlighted in each review. Cooling performance Regarding cooling products, performance is one of the most important things we consider. The word \"cooling\" gets tossed around a lot in the mattress industry, but very few mattress toppers actually cool you. Most of the time, they pull heat away from the body with gel foam or superior airflow. Price and warranty information It's important to us that all budgets and price points are reasonably reflected on our lists. We also compared the warranty information of each mattress topper so you know exactly what you get when you buy. Online shopping for mattress products can be intimidating. Thankfully, most companies offer robust trial periods and free returns. What to consider when shopping for the best cooling mattress topper The mattress topper market is flooded with various options, making it difficult to choose the best mattress topper for your needs. With cooling mattress toppers, the search can get even more involved. How do you know which toppers cool you and which are just clever marketing? Thankfully, a few key factors can help you determine your ideal cooling mattress topper. Material: The first thing to remember when shopping for the best cooling mattress topper is what it's made of. Most of this comes down to preference -- do you like memory foam? Or want a more natural option? Some materials, like latex foam, are naturally cooler than foam. Thickness and firmness: Many cooling mattress toppers have various thickness and firmness options. This is important for how much you want to change the feel of your mattress. You can turn a too-firm mattress into a plush memory foam dream with a topper. Alternatively, you can also firm up your mattress with a topper. Cooling features: Cooling mattresses and toppers will have additional features that contribute to their cooling -- that's what sets them apart from standard mattress toppers. Look for cooling elements like phase-change material, copper or graphite-infused or heat-wicking innovation. Cleaning: Cooling foam toppers are not like sheets -- you can't just throw them in the washing machine. They are similar to mattresses in that they have very specific cleaning instructions, most of which are spot-clean only. However, if you're prone to spills, opting for a cooling mattress topper with a removable and machine-washable cover is a good idea. Other mattress toppers we've tested We've tested a ton of mattress toppers, not just the ones that cool you. We've even made a list of the best mattress toppers to help make it easier to find your ideal match. Here are some other toppers we've tested that are worth checking out. Allswell 4-inch Topper Infused with Copper Gel: The Allswell mattress topper has a two-layer design that offers two inches of comfort on top and two inches of support below. It strikes a nice balance between being a comfortable topper that doesn't sacrifice support. Layla Memory Foam Topper: The Layla topper is a great option if you want to soften your mattress, but you don't want a dense memory foam feel. You know, the feeling of the bed slowly swallowing you up. You won't find that with the Layla topper. This memory topper has a light and airy, neutral-foam feel. Birch Plus Organic Mattress Topper: The Birch mattress topper is made from cotton and latex, which makes it hypoallergenic and antimicrobial. It's a good option if you want a firm feel when you sleep. The latex also allows for increased airflow. DreamFoam Gel Swirl Topper: If you're looking for a true memory foam mattress topper feel, you'll love the DreamFoam Gel Swirl Topper. It has between a medium and medium-soft firmness level. What's the difference between a cooling pad, cooling protector and cooling topper? The best cooling mattress toppers, pads and protectors often get lumped together. However, there are a few key differences between them. Cooling mattress toppers go on top of your mattress and often have straps that secure it to the bed. They are most often used to add substantial pressure relief or change how your mattress feels. A cooling mattress topper can make your bed more or less firm. They range from one to four inches thick. Cooling mattress pads add cushion to your mattress, but they don't change how your bed feels. Cooling mattress protectors encase your mattress to protect it from spills and dust mites. Some have minimal padding but not as much as a mattress pad or topper. Other cooling sleeping products Hot sleepers have many options for cooling down at night. If you're ready to dive into cooling mattresses, we tested the top options available on our best cooling mattress review, which features mattresses like Ghostbed Luxe and Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe. We know mattresses and even mattress toppers, for that matter, are expensive. Thankfully, you can still get some cooling relief without breaking the bank and opt for cooling sheets or pillows..

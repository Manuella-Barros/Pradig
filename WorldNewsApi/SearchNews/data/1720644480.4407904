Each morning will feature a Golf Talk Today, where the crew will discuss various elements throughout the PGA Tour, LPGA, LIV Golf, and more. In this first installment, let\u2019s discuss the first and second rounds of the Memorial Tournament and why Golf Twitter continues to be undefeated when it comes to trolling. So brew a pot of coffee, grab some breakfast, and settle in as we discuss the top stories in professional golf. First, let\u2019s take a look at the leaderboard after 36 holes. 1. Scottie Scheffler: -9 T2. Adam Hadwin: -6T2: Viktor Hovland: -6T4: Christiaan Bezuidenhout: -5T4: Keegan Bradley: -56: Ludvig \u00c5berg: -4 T7: Tony Finau: -3T7: Rory McIlroy: -3T7: Xander Schauffele: -3T7: Akshay Bhatia: -3 Scottie Scheffler holds a comfortable 3-stroke lead over Adam Hadwin and Viktor Hovland. However, there is a lot of golf left to play. This leaderboard is full of the best players in the world. From Scheffler to Rory McIlroy and PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, this is the kind of top-10 fans want to see at events. Muirfield Village will have its claws out for the week, but the conditions could continue to cause players even more issues. As one of the three Signature Events with a cut, the Memorial saw some popular names head home early. The top 50 and ties from this 73-player field received third-round tee times. The most notable PGA Tour players to miss the cut are reigning U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark, Jordan Spieth, Mackenzie Hughes, Patrick Cantlay, Justin Rose, and Rickie Fowler. Additional footage from Scottie Scheffler\u2019s arrest at the PGA Championship surfaced on Friday afternoon. Golf Twitter trolled in an epic way, making the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) look silly about the whole situation.

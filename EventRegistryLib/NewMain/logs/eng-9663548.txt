The area includes the Voyageurs National Park and the western Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness along with International Falls, Duluth, Ely, Hibbing and Grand Marais.\n\nA tornado touched down near Cotton, Minn., but no damage was immediately reported, the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Transportation is advising motorists using stretches of Hwy. 1 between Silver Bay and Ely and Hwy. 61 between Beaver Bay and Lutsen to \"drive with extreme caution\" as water and debris cover portions of the highways. Motorists on Hwys. 53 and 135 in near Virginia were advised to consider alternate routes, the agency said.\n\nFlash flooding had the I-35 tunnel in Duluth closed for a time Tuesday night, but the freeway was back open Wednesday morning, MnDOT reported.\n\n\"The flooding will continue overnight and may get worse before it improves,\" the National Weather Service in Duluth said. \"Rivers and streams remain high and some continue to rapidly increase.\"\n\nFirst responders attempted to reach a 9-year-old boy in a tent who was struck by a tree that fell in the BWCA during the storm. A boat was going to be used to evacuate the victim, the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nDry conditions are predicted for Wednesday across most of Minnesota before another chance of rain returns Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nIn the metro area, in anticipation of high water, the Minnesota Department of Transportation will close the Hwy. 41 Minnesota River crossing between Hwy. 169 and downtown Chaska at 9 a.m. Thursday. MnDOT has already called off this weekend's closure of portions of northbound Interstate 35W, southbound I-35W, and eastbound I-494 in Bloomington and Richfield due to the expected inclement weather. This closure will take place the weekend of June 28.\n\nIn Carver County, officials have shut down County Road 123 north of Hwy. 7 as water from the nearby Crow River covered the road. County Road 30 is closed west of New Germany to Lester Prairie, the Carver County Sheriff's Office posted on X Tuesday evening. And others may be too, said Ari Lyksett, a spokeswoman for Carver County.\n\n\"We are ready to activate any needed emergency procedures in the event of high-water conditions as we monitor throughout the day and continue to receive regular updates from the National Weather Service in Chanhassen,\" she said.\n\nIn Delano, public works crews installed a flood wall along the east side of Bridge Avenue on Tuesday as a precaution to keep water out of the downtown area. The Crow River is expected to crest Sunday at 20 feet, about 4 feet above flood stage.\n\n\"We felt it was a good move to put it up now,\" said Mayor Holly Schrupp, who noted there has not been any flooding in downtown yet. \"We are taking the measures we need to take.\"\n\nOfficials in Mankato have closed the campground at Land of Memories Park and trails next to the Minnesota River, a press statement from the city said Tuesday. City staff are also preparing work details for potential patrols of Mankato's levee and flood walls.\n\nWater rose quickly along the Minnesota River from New Ulm in southern Minnesota to the south metro suburb of Savage. The rushing Cannon River and branches of the Crow River in Hennepin, Wright and Carver counties were nearing flood stage in places. Flood warnings were in place along those waterways, the National Weather Service said.\n\nStorms traveling over the same area of already waterlogged ground could lead to flash flooding. Those living near water should prepare to immediately move to higher ground should flooding occur, the Department of Public Safety's Homeland Security and Emergency Management said.\n\nThe agency also warned people not to park vehicles near streams or drive through flooded areas. Officials also advised not to wade through flood waters, which can be filled with debris and could be contaminated with sewage, insects or animals.\n\nThe odds that water will recede fast are slim, said Jeff Strock, a professor at the University of Minnesota's Southwest Research and Outreach Center in Lamberton. On Tuesday, farm fields along the Hwy. 14 corridor from Waseca to the west had standing water. With the soil saturated, the water and any rain that falls will run off into rivers and streams and push water higher. The long-term impact will be felt in urban areas like the metro as the glut makes its way downstream.\n\n\"The flooding situation could last for a while,\" Strock said.\n\nAnd so could the impact as farmers won't be able to replant their crops, urban roads flood and rushing water poses dangers for venturing onto lakes and rivers.\n\nThe June deluge has \"been way too much of a good thing,\" Strock said. \"We'll feel a lot of downsides for a while.\"By Tuesday morning, the storms had dropped 4.28 inches of rain in the Twin Cities, but some places in southern Minnesota have seen 3 to 10 inches of rain in the past few days.\n\nWet Junes are nothing unusual, said Assistant State Climatologist Pete Boulay.\n\n\"It's very typical,\" he said. \"We just have not had that in the past four years. Every year the jet stream moves north. Welcome back to an active pattern.\"\n\nAs soggy as it has been, this June is nowhere near the wettest on record. That distinction belongs to 1874 when 11.67 inches of rain fell in June. For 2024 to crack the top 15 wettest Junes, another 2.83 inches would need to fall at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where the metro area's official weather readings are taken, the Climatology Office said.\n\nPlagued by very dry conditions last summer, the entire state has seen adequate precipitation this year and is drought-free, according to the latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_harlow@startribune.com", "name": "Tim Harlow", "type": "author",

The warnings extend through the night.\n\nFor the latest on road impacts and closures due to flooding, go to MNDOT 511.\n\nAnother system moving in will bring up to 4 more inches of rain Thursday through Saturday, filling rivers, streams and creeks and pushing them over their banks, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"River flooding will worsen through the week with moderate to major flooding at some locations,\" the NWS said.\n\nNWS issued a flash-flood warning in north central Minnesota, Koochiching, North Cass, Itasca and central and northern St. Louis counties.

That number was down from nearly 13,000 earlier in the day.\n\nRochester Public Utilities was also reporting nearly 2,000 customers without power as of early afternoon, after the storms downed trees and power lines in the city.\n\nBENCO Electric Cooperative, East Central Energy, Federated Rural Electric, Minnesota Valley Electric Cooperative and Steele Waseca Cooperative Electric each reported several hundred of their customers without power early Monday, but most of those outages had been repaired as of midday.\n\nThose outages were prompted by a line of storms that produced a wind gust of 73 mph near Rushmore in southwest Minnesota. The National Weather Service also reported gusts of 67 mph near Fairmont and 63 mph near Trimont.\n\nThere were several severe thunderstorm warnings across far southern Minnesota during the early morning hours.\n\nIn addition to strong winds, the storms brought very heavy rain to central and southern Minnesota -- with much more on the way over the coming days.\n\nA flood watch is in effect for much of the region, and the weather service said the rounds of heavy rain could add up to 3 to 6 inches over the next week. That could lead to flash flooding as well as river flooding.\n\nModerate to major flooding is forecast along the South Fork Crow River west of the Twin Cities. Carver County has closed County Highway 123 between Watertown and Mayer due to rising water levels.\n\nOfficials in Delano are preparing to respond to flooding along the Crow River. Water levels were nearing 15 feet as of Monday morning, and are forecast to reach moderate flood levels above 17 feet by Wednesday.\n\nMayor Holly Schrupp said crews installed electric pumps in low areas of town Monday morning. Staff are prepared to install the city's metal flood wall later this week.\n\n\"We have certain river levels that we take different actions at,\" Schrupp said. \"Public works is working on making sure that we have everything we need in place.\"\n\nSchrupp says the city will keep its social media updated with information on flooding and any road closures.\n\nFlood warnings are also in effect for

Most of the closed roads are in the northern part of the county, which stretches from Duluth to the Canadian border, said Dana Kazel, communications manager for St. Louis County.\n\nThe Twin Cities and southern Minnesota are in line to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain through Saturday, with isolated pockets of 6 inches of rain, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"River flooding will worsen through the week with moderate or major flooding at some locations,\" the weather service said.\n\nSeveral entry points to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness are currently closed due to road washouts, flooding and downed trees, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service said. Permits reserved through Saturday have been canceled and visitors are being notified, the Forest Service said.\n\nMuch of Minnesota State Hwy. 1 between Hwy. 53 and Silver Bay on Lake Superior remained closed for a second straight day, the Minnesota Department of Transportation said.\n\nRising water forced MnDOT to shut down Hwy. 41 between downtown Chaska and Hwy. 169 in Carver County Thursday morning. The county also closed County Road 11 across the Minnesota River near Jordan, the only northern route out of the city.\n\nFurther south, MnDOT shut down Hwy. 19 between Hwy. 169 and downtown Henderson, Minn., forcing drivers on a long detour due to other roads in the area being under construction.\n\nThe odds of more roads being added to the closure list across the state are high as multiple rounds of heavy rain are expected through Saturday.\n\nFlood warnings remain in effect across the hard-hit Arrowhead Region where up to 7 inches of rain has already fallen this week. They also are in place along the Minnesota River from Mankato to Jordan to Savage and along the Crow River in places such as Delano, Mayer and Rockford, the National Weather Service said.\n\nIn Waterville, officials are seeking volunteers to fill sandbags and limit water use.

The second round is set to arrive Friday evening and the third and final round is forecasted to sweep across the area Saturday morning, the forecast says.\n\nForecasters are predicting widespread rainfall amounts ranging from 2-4 inches by Saturday morning. Some areas in the flood risk zone could receive up to six inches of rain.\n\nThe predicted heavy rainfall could also cause rivers in southeastern Minnesota to rise to flood level by next week.

We're on a hill,\" said Lois Pajari, owner of Cook's Country Connection petting zoo in Cook. \"But our community is in trouble.\"\n\nPajari said there is waist-deep water in some locations in the St. Louis County community of 500, and she's heard of basements completely full of water up to the home's main level.\n\nBut residents are helping each other out.\n\nPajari said she was loading gravel from a pit at midnight Wednesday so volunteers could fill sandbags, and she's caring for a flock of chickens for someone who had to evacuate their home. \"Everybody's sticking together and doing what we can to save what we can,\" Pajari said.\n\nWhile there was initial flash flooding in Cook during Tuesday's storm -- 4.2 inches of rain fell just north of Cook, according to the National Weather Service -- the headwaters of the Little Fork near Lake Vermilion saw some of the highest amounts of rain, causing the river to flood in late afternoon Wednesday and keep rising overnight.\n\nKetzel Levens, meteorologist and a co-manager of the hydrology program at the National Weather Service Office in Duluth, said the 7.6 inches of rain that fell near Tower and the headwaters took some time to reach Cook.\n\n\"All of that water is finally able to work its way through our water systems -- through those little creeks and rivers -- that's when we start to get that convergence of all that water that was leading to overland flash flooding concerns, (and) now is turning into riverine flooding in those community that are in low-lying areas along rivers,\" Levens said.\n\nWater levels on the Little Fork River at Linden Grove, approximately nine miles west of Cook, continue to rise. As of 8:45 a.m. Thursday, the river reached 38.82 feet, 8 feet higher than before Tuesday's rain, according to the National Water Prediction Service.\n\n\"The rate of rise doesn't appear to be slowing just yet,\" Levens said. \"So we aren't seeing any indication of it turning over or at least peaking today. I would expect probably sometime in the next couple of days.\"\n\nMore rain is on the way, but the heaviest amounts are expected to fall on central and southern Minnesota, Levens said.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, another half-inch to an inch of rain could fall on Cook between Friday afternoon and Saturday evening.\n\n\"Any additional rain, what that's going to lead to is just a longer period of that high water and the recession rate being slower,\" Levens said.\n\nMeanwhile Thursday, the St. Louis County Board of Commissioners called a special meeting to declare the recent flooding events a natural disaster.\n\nCounty Board Chair Keith Nelson estimated flood waters have inflicted \"north of $50 million\" in damages so far, based on what he called \"a back-of-the-napkin guess.\"\n\nJim Foldesi, the county's director of public works, said 45 roads remain closed due to flood damage and continued high water. He noted that until those waters recede, it will be impossible to determine the level of damage caused by recent weather.\n\nFoldesi said the flood ranks as the second-most-damaging event he has experienced in his 31-year career with the county, surpassed only by a flood that occurred nearly 12 years ago.\n\nWith the weather forecast threatening to drop more rain on the region, Foldesi said the situation could still worsen.\n\nThe county's emergency declaration could open the door for state and federal emergency assistance to flow, helping to assist with repairs. Nelson said he had been in touch with Gov. Tim Walz, who pledged to render state assistance.\n\nEmergency Support Services Director Dewey Johnson said the county is better prepared to handle a challenging situation, following past ordeals, including the unparalleled flood of 2012, which hit Duluth hard. He said the county has 150,000 sandbags in stock.\n\n\"We're in a much better place,\" Johnson said.\n\nOfficials have been using drones to assess the damage.\n\nFoldesi said special attention has been devoted to parties with access cut off due to washed-out or flooded roadways. Some of these properties remain accessible only by boat.\n\nWhile the county seeks to assist residents, it is also taking care to document the level of damage, in hopes of receiving state and federal aid to effect needed repairs.\n\nThe response has been complicated by the remote and rural nature of many areas impacted by the storm, which Nelson described as roughly \"the northern third\" of the county.\n\n\"Let's pray we don't get more rain,\" he said, noting that the Northland is entirely saturated at this point, with nowhere for water to go but up.\n\nReservoirs north of Duluth are near capacity as well, and pending releases in the coming days are expected to impact additional communities downstream, Johnson said.\n\n\"It's been a journey, and it's not over,\" said County Administrator Kevin Gray.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Pajari", "type":

After a break for the holiday, 10 staff are deployed across northeastern and southeastern Minnesota. USGS activities include measurements, collecting water-quality samples, monitoring LSPIV sites, communicating and coordinating with other agencies via email and NWSChat, and responding to questions from the public. No telemetered sites with more than 20 years of record have recorded peaks of record yet. From the NWS, 13 gages are above Flood Action Levels, 5 above minor flood levels, and one above major flood level.\n\nUp to five inches of rain is forecast for southern Minnesota today through Saturday.

We're on a hill,\" said Lois Pajari, owner of Cook's Country Connection petting zoo in Cook. \"But our community is in trouble.\"\n\nPajari said there is waist-deep water in some locations, and she's heard of basements completely full of water up to the home's main level.\n\nBut residents are helping each other out.\n\nPajari said she was loading gravel from a pit at midnight Thursday so volunteers could fill sandbags, and she's caring for a flock of chickens for someone who had to evacuate their home Wednesday.\n\n\"Everybody's sticking together and doing what we can to save what we can,\" Pajari said.\n\nWhile there was initial flash flooding in Cook during Tuesday's storm -- 4.2 inches of rain fell just north of Cook, according to the National Weather Service -- the headwaters of the river near Lake Vermilion saw some of the highest amounts of rain, causing the river to flood in late afternoon Wednesday and keep rising overnight.\n\nKetzel Levens, meteorologist and a co-manager of the hydrology program at the National Weather Service Office in Duluth, said the 7.6 inches of rain that fell near Tower and the headwaters took some time to reach Cook.\n\n\"All of that water is finally able to work its way through our water systems -- through those little creeks and rivers -- that's when we start to get that convergence of all that water that was leading to overland flash flooding concerns, (and) now is turning into riverine flooding in those community that are in low-lying areas along rivers,\" Levens said.\n\nWater levels on the Little Fork River at Linden Grove, approximately nine miles west of Cook, continue to rise. As of 8:45 a.m. Thursday, the river reached 38.82 feet, 8 feet higher than before Tuesday's rain, according to the National Water Prediction Service.\n\n\"The rate of rise doesn't appear to be slowing just yet,\" Levens said. \"So we aren't seeing any indication of it turning over or at least peaking today. I would expect probably sometime in the next couple of days.\"\n\nMore rain is on the way, but the heaviest amounts are expected to fall on central and southern Minnesota, Levens said.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, another half-inch to an inch of rain could fall on Cook between Friday afternoon and Saturday evening.\n\n\"Any additional rain, what that's going to lead to is just a longer period of that high water and the recession rate being slower,\" Levens said.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Pajari", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sami Pajari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_source", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River source"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Range", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron Range"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayfield_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayfield County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayfield County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levens,_Alpes-Maritimes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Levens, Alpes-Maritimes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Vermilion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Vermilion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duluth, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Duluth, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fusion", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fusion", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity_Cooking", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity Cooking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Techniques", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Techniques", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/4a737a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1536+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F15%2F40%2F5433cc5943cbbf0783b58f2891cd%2Fgqewojgweaaxnbj.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663548", "eventUri": "eng-9663548", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 225039470, "title": "Skip Starbucks and sip locally at these 4 Denver boba tea shops", "text": "Bubble tea has been a staple in Asia since the \u201880s, but its popularity is exploding stateside. The often technicolored Taiwan-born drink is made with a hot or cold tea base combined with milk, fruit or fruit juices and finished with \u201cbubbles\u201d or \u201cbobas\u201d \u2014 soft and chewy tapioca pearls that sit at the bottom. It is typically served in clear, plastic cups with wide straws to suck up the bubbles. In May, Starbucks decided to jump on the bandwagon and release its own version. The coffee conglomerate now features a trio of drinks on its menu, all of which include bright pink, boba-style pearls filled with berry juice. The move isn\u2019t surprising as the global bubble tea market is expected to reach more than $4.5 billion by 2026, according to a 2022 report by the Facts & Factors market research firm. It\u2019s hot in metro Denver as well: On Colorado Boulevard alone, there are at least eight bubble tea shops, including local businesses like Tea Street and chains like Gong Cha. But not all boba teas are the same, said Tea Street co-founder Victoria Lam, especially when it comes to Starbucks. \u201cJust because you add boba to an existing drink, it doesn\u2019t make it a bubble tea. I think it\u2019s creative and fun, but it\u2019s a little bit different. \u201cIt\u2019s great if [Starbucks] wants to do it as an acknowledgment to the Asian-American culture, but if it\u2019s just to save their business, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best approach,\u201d she added. For those who want to sip their bubble tea locally and get a taste of authenticity, here are four shops for your consideration: Tea Street Lam opened Tea Street with her brother Patrick in 2018. The Colorado-born duo makes everything in-house and intertwines their Cantonese and Vietnamese background throughout the menu. That includes creations like pickled lemonade, a sweet and salty drink reminiscent of their childhood, and black sesame milk tea, inspired by a dessert they ate growing up. Guests can add honey, crystal or brown sugar boba, as well as a variety of bursting boba, jelly and fruity pudding to any of their drinks. Lam said Tea Street\u2019s taro slush, a frozen drink made with the Southeast Asian veggie, as well as the Hong Kong-style milk tea, brewed like coffee and served hot, are some of their most popular menu items. Drinks range from $4.75 to $5.65. \u201cWhen we first opened, we were one of a handful. Now even just on Colorado Boulevard, we\u2019re one of at least 10 different shops,\u201d Lam said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a bad thing, though. Bubble tea is becoming synonymous with coffee, and just like coffee shops pop up everywhere, people can find their perfect match.\u201d 4090 E. Mississippi Ave., Denver; teastreetdenver.com Daboba Stephanie Richter opened Daboba near Denver\u2019s Union Station in 2022. Unlike Tea Street, Daboba only offers brown sugar boba and jelly as a topping. Richter brews all of the tea in-house daily and buys the same U.S.-made boba as popular California chain Boba Guys, which she considers \u201cthe best you could possibly buy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do popping boba because it\u2019s not traditional,\u201d Richter said. \u201cI feel like Starbucks is mocking that tradition and jumping on the trend in a bad way. People shouldn\u2019t be judging boba based on what Starbucks is making because it\u2019s just pure sugar. There\u2019s such an art to cooking boba and brewing high-quality tea.\u201d Daboba\u2019s drinks range from $3.25 for a shot of espresso to $7.75 for a large roasted brown sugar pearl espresso. Richter said the shop\u2019s new Creme Brulee series, which features homemade creme brulee mixed with ube or matcha, has been a hit, and the fresh watermelon green tea with lychee jelly is a summertime favorite. 1920 17th St., Unit 100, Denver; dabobadenver.com Lollicup Lollicup was one of the first bubble tea shops in Denver when it debuted in 2003. \u201cYou had to drive to another city to get to another boba shop when we first opened,\u201d said June Yuan, daughter of Lollicup owners Mei and Khu Yuan. At first, their only customers were of Asian descent or people who were familiar with Taiwanese culture. But over the years, the shop has found its niche in introducing newcomers to bubble tea. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown with our customers and Denver, and we know what people are looking for to ease their way into boba culture,\u201d Yuan said. For example, for the surrounding Latino population, they\u2019ve added a Mango Fruit Slush with Chamoy and chili powder. For the kids, they have plenty of fruity lemonades with popping boba. \u201cKids fell in love with popping boba during the frozen yogurt craze, so they\u2019re more familiar with it,\u201d Yuan said. As for Starbucks\u2019 take on the trend, the Yuans couldn\u2019t believe it at first and speculated it was an attempt to boost business during trying times. \u201cThey\u2019re jumping on what they think is a temporary fad, but this is our livelihood,\u201d she said. 1589 S. Colorado Blvd., Glendale; 1046 S. Federal Blvd., Denver; lollicupdenver.com Die Die Must Try Beverage Co. Ben Chow, his wife and his parents opened Die Die Must Try in Cherry Creek North, after spending two decades in Singapore, where boba is very common. The bubble tea shop has a smaller menu than most with a selection of Singapore specials, milk teas, fruit teas and not-teas. \u201cIt looks more like a cocktail menu because we wanted to hyper-focus on these few hits to reach the audience we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Chow said. Toppings include brown sugar boba, passionfruit, mango, strawberry or lychee popping boba, aloe vera, grass jelly, mangosteen pudding or red bean. Die Die Must Try is named after a Singapore phrase meaning something\u2019s so good you have to try it. The Chows added their own touch to the menu with Singapore flavors like Coconut Pandan, soursop and calamansi. They also aerate the tea by pouring it between two mugs, a Singapore tradition, and serve to-go drinks in a da bao bag. \u201cWhen Starbucks dropped their drink, I was excited because it means boba as a drink has reached a point where the general public is becoming more interested and familiar with it,\u201d Chow said. 250 Steele St., Unit 108, Denver; diediedenver.com Subscribe to our new food newsletter, Stuffed, to get Denver food and drink news sent straight to your inbox.", "summary": "\"It\u2019s great if [Starbucks] wants to do it as an acknowledgment to the Asian-American culture, but if it\u2019s just to save their business, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best approach.\"", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2024/05/29/denvers-best-boba-bubble-tea-shops/", "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-Z-daboba-db-052324-0077Ax.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:37", "author": "Lily O'Neill", "authors": ["Lily O'Neill"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.791}

Now scientists writing in Frontiers in Plant Science have found that exposure to high levels of artificial light at night makes tree leaves grow tougher and harder for insects to eat, threatening urban food chains.\n\n\"We noticed that, compared to natural ecosystems, tree leaves in most urban ecosystems generally show little sign of insect damage. We were curious as to why,\" said corresponding author Dr Shuang Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"Here we show that in two of the most common tree species in Beijing, artificial light at night led to increased leaf toughness and decreased levels of leaf herbivory.\"\n\nShedding some light\n\nArtificial light has increased levels of night-time brightness by almost 10%: most of the world's population experiences light pollution every night. Because plant properties affect their interactions with other plants and animals, any changes to plants caused by artificial light could have a significant impact on the ecosystem.\n\n\"Leaves that are free of insect damage may bring comfort to people, but not insects,\" said Zhang. \"Herbivory is a natural ecological process that maintains the biodiversity of insects.\"\n\nThe scientists suspected that plants experiencing high levels of artificial light would focus on defense rather than growth, producing tougher leaves with more chemical defense compounds. To test this, they selected two common species of street tree: Japanese pagoda and green ash trees. Although these trees are similar in many ways, Japanese pagoda trees have smaller, softer leaves which herbivores prefer.\n\nThe scientists identified 30 sampling sites spaced by roughly 100 meters on main roads which are usually illuminated all night. To determine the level of exposure to artificial lighting, they measured illuminance at each site. Almost 5,500 leaves were collected and evaluated for insect herbivory and traits that could be affected by artificial light, like size, toughness, water content, and levels of nutrients and chemical defenses.\n\nLarger leaves would indicate resources allocated to growth, while toughness and higher levels of chemical defenses like tannins would indicate resources allocated to defense. Meanwhile, higher levels of water and nutrients indicate higher-quality nutrition to tempt herbivores.\n\nHard to swallow\n\nFor both species of tree, higher levels of artificial light meant tougher leaves. The tougher the leaf, the less evidence of insect herbivory. The more intense the light, the more frequently scientists encountered leaves that showed no signs at all of herbivory.\n\n\"The underlying mechanism for this pattern is not yet fully understood,\" said Zhang. \"It is possible that trees exposed to artificial light at night may extend their photosynthesis duration. Additionally, these leaves might allocate a greater proportion of resources to structural compounds, such as fibers, which could lead to an increase in leaf toughness.\"\n\nJapanese pagoda trees exposed to more artificial light had lower levels of nutrients like phosphorus: where Japanese pagoda leaves had more nutrients, more herbivory occurred. But green ash leaves were more strongly influenced by higher light levels: they had higher levels of nitrogen, smaller leaves, and lower chemical defenses.\n\nThis could be because green ash trees are less preferred by herbivores, so they can afford to allocate resources to growth. Meanwhile, Japanese pagoda trees put more resources into defense, lowering their nutrient content.\n\nInsects going hungry\n\n\"Decreased herbivory can lead to trophic cascading effects in ecology,\" said Zhang. \"Lower levels of herbivory imply lower abundances of herbivorous insects, which could in turn result in lower abundances of predatory insects, insect-eating birds, and so on. The decline of insects is a global pattern observed over recent decades. We should pay more attention to this trend.\"\n\nAlthough leaf toughness is a mechanical defense against predation, it is possible that other factors contribute to decreased herbivory: for instance, more light could make insects more visible to their predators. Further research will be needed to fully understand the effects of artificial light.\n\n\"Our study was conducted in only one city and involved just two tree species,\" cautioned Zhang. \"This limitation hinders our ability to generalize the conclusions to broader spatial and taxonomic scales.

The researchers who discovered the pattern say it could have a detrimental effect on biodiversity in cities by preventing the flow of energy up the food chain.\n\nShuang Zhang and his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences decided to investigate the effect of artificial light on trees after Zhang noticed that Japanese pagoda (Styphnolobium japonicum) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanicaa) trees on the streets of Beijing seemed to suffer relatively little insect damage compared with other trees in the city.\n\nThe researchers collected around 5500 leaves from 180 trees at 30 sites in Beijing, some near the characteristic orange glow of sodium streetlights and others where nights are dark, and measured their size, toughness, water content and nutrient levels. They also recorded any evidence of insect damage.\n\nLeaves taken from under streetlights were tougher and had less insect damage. On Japanese pagoda trees, the amount of leaf damage was 2.1 per cent in areas with streetlights and 5.3 per cent in dark areas, while the amount of leaf damage on green ash trees was 2 per cent near streetlights and 4.1 per cent in dark areas.\n\nThe researchers weren't available to answer questions, but they say in their paper that a decrease in leaves eaten by insects will mean less energy flowing up the food chain to insects and birds, leading to a cascading effect that further reduces biodiversity.\n\nThe team acknowledges that more investigation is needed because the mechanism leading to lower leaf damage isn't yet understood. It could be that more light makes insects more visible to predators, reducing their numbers and therefore their effect on trees, for example.\n\nOwen Lewis at the University of Oxford says the study is interesting but doesn't show a causal link. He suggests future studies should take plants from areas with and without streetlights, place them in a controlled environment, and then observe insect habits to see if they show a preference for trees grown in dark conditions.\n\nLewis also points out that measuring herbivory is complex: more damage may mean a leaf has lower nutritional value and insects therefore have to eat more of it. Holes caused by insect damage can also grow as the leaf grows in size, he says.\n\n\"My hunch is that this could be quite a subtle effect,\" he says. \"In the middle of Beijing, the subtle effects of light pollution on insect herbivory, compared to the effects of how urbanised [the area is], how much pollution there is, how much semi-natural habitat there is - it's likely to be trivial. It's important, but it's probably not the principal threat to insect diversity and ecosystem function.\"", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biodiversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styphnolobium_japonicum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Styphnolobium japonicum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraxinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus_pennsylvanica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Light pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herbivore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urbanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Horticulture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Horticulture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Field Crops", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Durian", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Durian", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/02143112/SEI_215292958.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790664", "eventUri": "eng-9790664", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

study.\n\nScientists at Beijing's University of Chinese Academy of Sciences noticed that tree leaves next to streetlights seemed to show less damage from insects than trees in rural areas.\n\nThey set about studying 180 trees around roads in Beijing that are illuminated by streetlights, measuring how much light each tree was getting and then studying almost 5,500 leaves for their different properties.\n\nThe leaves' toughness, nitrogen levels, tannins and water content were all measured, which gave the scientists an idea of how the trees were using their resources.\n\nPlants under stress often put their energy into defending themselves by becoming tougher and adding chemical defences like tannins.\n\nThat's what seems to be happening to trees constantly lit by natural light and then street lights.\n\nThe more artificial light there was at night, the tougher the leaves became.\n\nThe toughest leaves were found in the areas lit most brightly, and showed no signs of insects eating them.\n\nBecause of their tougher structures, the leaves were also likely to decompose more slowly, which could change the composition of soil underneath and around the trees.\n\nRobins, crows, blue tits and moths\n\nStreetlights are not just changing the structure of plants, they impact the environment around them in a number of ways.\n\nBirds, like robins and crows, have been found to sing and forage for food at night when they live near artificial light, according to the British Trust for Ornithology.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nWarning over 'explosion' of fake weight loss injection

Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Newcastle University and Butterfly Conservation found the new LED bulbs were even worse for insects.\n\nThe new bulbs reduced moth caterpillars in hedgerows by 52% compared to nearby unlit areas, whereas sodium lights reduced the population by 41%.\n\nThe researchers think street lights may deter nocturnal moths from laying their eggs or put the insects at risk

{"id": 223754624, "title": "FG Destroying Public Universities For Private To Thrive - ASUU", "text": "PORT HARCOURT \u2013 The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has accused the Federal Government of systematically destroying the public university system in the country, to pave the way for private ones to thrive. The Union said the government, in its bid to hatch it\u2019s plan, had been formulating retrogressive policies to cripple the public tertiary education. Speaking during a press conference at the University of Port Harcourt over the weekend, the Port Harcourt Zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Comrade Stanley Ogoun, vowed that the union would continue to resist the plot to ensure that average Nigerian children have access to an affordable tertiary education in the country. Ogoun was accompanied by Union\u2019s Chairpersons from the University of Port Harcourt, Comrade Uzomma Darlington Chima, Bayelsa Medical University, Comrade Sylva Logeiaziba, University of Africa, Comrade Donny Sigah, Federal University, Otuoke, Comrade Bruno Ikula and Comrade Austen Sado, National Investment Secretary, ASUU. Others are, Comrade Ekaette Ekpo, Chairperson, Ignatius Ajuru University of Education, Port Harcourt, , Rivers State University, Port Harcourt, Comrade Emmanuel Emwulo, Niger Delta University, Bayelsa, Comrade Oyinkepreye Lucky Bebeteidoh and the University of Port Harcourt ASUU Secretary, Comrade Salem Ocala Ejaba. Ogoun said, \u201cAs part of our union\u2019s concerted efforts towards mitigating the deliberate provocation by governments across board to proceed on an industrial action, we are calling on all well-meaning Nigerians to prevail on governments at the federal and state levels to prioritize education as the proven path to national development. \u201cThrough acts of deliberate delay and nonchalance, the government is fanning the embers of crisis in the public university system. From the insincere utterances of government to deliberate connivance between the political elites and select bureaucrats, the public university space is being emasculated and crippled to enact an overall conquest, towards feeding their primitive and compulsive economic dominance of all sectors. \u201cFrom systematic onslaught on the public university space through well-crafted obnoxious and retrogressive policies to deliberate neglect, it has become apparent that the Nigerian ruling class is working relentlessly towards ensuring a total collapse of the public university system, with a view to expanding the frontiers of its profiteering escapade.\u201d ASUU also accused President Bola Tinubu\u2019s Chief of Staff, Femi Gbajabiamila of frustrating efforts of the union in settling lingering issues with the government. \u201cThe former House of Reps Speaker who is now a strong pillar in the current government has suddenly become incapacitated in resolving the matters he so taunted to resolve as archived in the media space. He has deliberately decided not to use his position and executive powers (which he claimed he didn\u2019t have then) towards resolving the pending issues. \u201cEfforts at seeing Mr. President to resolve the issues have been blocked by him; meanwhile, Mr. President has played host and is still playing host to several non-consequential visits as clearly seen in the public space.\u201d Ogoun regretted that President Tinubu had reneged on his promise of ending strikes in public universities, when apportioned less than 7 percent of the 2024 budgetary allocation to education. \u201cA clear evidence is the poor budgetary allocation to education in the 2024 annual budget, for which a similar trend is cascaded down the state levels. \u201cFor instance, a government that pronounced N15 trillion as contract sum for a project that was not competitively bided for, is claiming not to have funds (amounting to less than 7% of the N15 trillion) to commit to addressing the decay in all the public universities. What a tragedy!!\u201d Ogoun further asserted that the government had rather towed the path of the previous administration in refusing to prioritize education. \u201cOur Conditions of Service was last reviewed in 2009. The last attempt after several overtures to government was scuttled by the enemies of the Nigerian State led by the then labour Minister, Chris Ngige and his allies, whose primary interest remains the emasculation of the public space, towards feeding their quest for primitive and compulsive accumulation of our common wealth for their immediate families.\u201d ASUU however called on the government to pay the outstanding Earned Academic Allowance (EAA); and as well amend the NUC act to halt the proliferation of public universities without adequate funding of the existing ones, adding that Nigerians should hold the government accountable should there be any other disruption in the public university system. \u201cThere is a consensus amongst these seen and unseen anti-progressive hands to exterminate public universities, which they believe constitutes an impediment to their complete economic conquest of the country\u2019s education space. Hence, the ongoing systematically choreographed actions tailored at complete annihilation of public universities. Nigerians should hold the government accountable for any other disruption in the public university system. \u201cWe challenge the government to be alive to her responsibilities towards halting the massive decay in the Nigerian public university space and see if there will be any industrial action. Let it be known that the goal of saving the public university system from an imminent government-orchestrated extinction, should be the business of all true citizens of Nigeria. \u201cIf the ordinary Nigerians fail to see this as a common battle, we should all be prepared to accept the reality that university education would soon be an elitist exclusivity.\u201d", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"705\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/ASUU-1wx.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/ASUU-1wx.jpg 705w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/ASUU-1wx-300x173.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px\" /></div>PORT HARCOURT &#8211; The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has accused the Federal Government of systematically destroying the public university system in the country, to pave the way for private ones to thrive.

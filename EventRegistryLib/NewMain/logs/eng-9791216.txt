Streee 2 actress unfollows rumoured beau", "body": "A month after making her relationship with Rahul Mody Insta-official, Shraddha Kapoor has unfollowed him on Instagram. She has also unfollowed his sister, production house and his dog\n\nFor a long time now it has been rumoured that actress Shraddha Kapoor is dating writer Rahul Mody. But it seems like not all is well in paradise as Shraddha has unfollowed Rahul from her Instagram handle. She has also unfollowed the accounts of Rahul's sister, his production house and his dog. However, Rahul still follows Shraddha. This has left fans wondering if they have really broken up or is its some kind of promotional tactic for Shraddha's upcoming film 'Stree 2'.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRumours of Shraddha dating Rahul surfaced earlier this year. The two were also spotted together at the pre-wedding function of Anant and Radhika Ambani at Jamnagar in March this year.\n\nIn June this year, Shraddha revealed that she's dating Rahul Mody. She posted a picture with him on her Instagram Stories, addressing the dating rumours. In the photo, Shraddha is smiling at the camera while Rahul makes a funny face.\n\nWith the picture, Shraddha Kapoor wrote: \"Dil rakh le, neend to vaapis de de yaar.\" She included a few emojis like a laughing face and a heart. She also tagged Rahul in the picture.\n\nEarlier this year, a source mentioned to Hindustan Times that Shraddha and Rahul might announce their relationship officially soon, \"They are not afraid to be photographed with each other, but that doesn't mean they will make their relationship official anytime soon. They are both private people, and want to keep their relationship out of the limelight.\n\nOn the work front, Shraddha Kapoor is gearing up for the release of the film Stree 2'. The film that also stars Rajkummar Rao will be released in theatres on August 15.\n\nMid-day has learnt that she has also liked a drama to be backed by her rumoured beau, Rahul Mody, who co-wrote Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar. If things work out, the actor will not only headline the film, but also turn producer with it. Little is known about the movie's plot at present as the makers are keeping details under wraps. A source reveals, \"The talks are in the nascent stage, so it can't be determined whether this will be her next project. But Shraddha has liked the central idea. She plans to co-produce it along with Rahul's production house.\"", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraddha_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shraddha (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraddha_Kapoor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shraddha Kapoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jamnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_Jhoothi_Main_Makkaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mid-Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/aug/shraddha-k-thresa_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791216", "eventUri": "eng-9791216", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1794, "textEnd": 1803}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

On June 19, Shraddha herself announced her love on social media and shared a cosy picture of herself with writer-assistant director Rahul Mody on Instagram Stories. Along with this, she also wrote an emotional caption, 'Dil Rakh Le, Neend To Wapas De De Yaar'. It was only after this post came out that it was clear that the rumours were true and Shraddha was dating Rahul. The pair was also being spotted together, as well as both went on vacation.\n\nScreenshots went viral on social media\n\nAbout a month after the official announcement, Shraddha Kapoor has unfollowed Rahul and his pet dog on Instagram. As soon as Shraddha did this, the screenshot of her Instagram 'following' list started going viral. It started being discussed from Reddit to Instagram. A person shared it on Reddit and wrote, 'Shraddha has unfollowed Rahul Modi on Instagram. Even his sister, his production house and his dog. They had made the relationship official some time ago.'\n\nPeople's reaction\n\nNow as soon as the screenshots went viral, people's reactions have also started coming out. While several social media users wanted to know what could be the reason for doing this, many believe that the actress is doing this only for publicity. One user wrote, 'I think this is only for the promotion of Stree 2.' At the same time, another user wrote, 'What a sad life these people are living that they have to use their long-time partner as a tool on social media to increase people's interest in their films.' The third person wrote, 'Who unfollows a dog's profile? It seems this is a very personal matter.' At the same time, one got very emotional and wrote, 'Don't think that this is for publicity. This is a very serious matter. My ex-boyfriend removed the highlight of my dog and it felt like someone shot me in the head with a gun.'\n\nShraddha and Rahul met during this film\n\nTalking about the work front, Shraddha Kapoor starrer 'Stree 2' is going to be released in theatres on August 15. Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Aparshakti Khurana and Abhishek Banerjee will also be seen with the actress in this film. The actress was last seen in 'Tu Jhoothi Main Makkar'. During this film, she met Rahul Mody, who was the writer of this film. He also wrote the story of 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety' and 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2'.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraddha_Kapoor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shraddha Kapoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_Jhoothi_Main_Makkaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Banerjee_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Banerjee (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aparshakti_Khurana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aparshakti Khurana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pankaj Tripathi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkummar_Rao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajkummar Rao"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/file-image-2024-08-05t182448-1722862505.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791216", "eventUri": "eng-9791216", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 79, "textEnd": 86}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 2036, "textEnd": 2045}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 460559283, "relevance": 2}

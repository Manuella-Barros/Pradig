This breaks the draft bonus record previously held by Paul Skenes, who signed for $9.2 million with the Pittsburgh Pirates after being selected first overall in the 2023 MLB Draft.\n\nBurns' Transfer to Wake Forest Pays Off\n\nBurns, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 MLB Draft, transferred from Tennessee to Wake Forest ahead of the 2024 college baseball season. Seeking to elevate his game, he took advantage of the training opportunities at Wake Forest's renowned \"pitching lab.\" Burns' decision to bet on himself paid off, resulting in a higher draft position and a record-setting bonus.\n\nChase Burns spent his first two collegiate seasons at Tennessee before transferring to Wake Forest for his final year. Ranked fifth in ESPN's final draft rankings, Burns is projected to land 44th on the minor league Top 100 prospects list once he turns pro.\n\n\"If I've heard it once, I've heard it 100 times in the (draft) room,\" Reds scouting director Joe Katuska said. \"He's a big hairy monster. Those are the guys that pitch in the front of the rotations. They pitch in October. They pitch at the end of games. They're the ones you want to give the ball to.\"\n\n\"It always feels good,\" Katuska said. \"Stage one is scouting a guy. Stage two is drafting him. Stage three is probably the most important part. Actually getting him signed. Going through the physical process and get their pen to paper.\"\n\nKatuska said that Burns' next step is to head to the team's spring training complex on Sunday and get on the field on Monday.\n\n\"The biggest thing first is figuring out where he is in a throwing progression,\" Katuska said. \"He still has some innings to throw. But it's been a little bit since he was on the mound in a game situation. We're going to protect the long-term and what the projection is for him.\"\n\nBurns Joins Another Wake Forest Product in Cincinnati\n\nHe was the consensus best pitcher in the draft, boasting a 96-100 mph fastball and a plus-plus slider, both considered among the draft's best pitches. This spring, Burns struck out a school-record 191 batters in 100 innings while walking just 30, finishing with a 2.70 ERA.\n\nAnother standout from Wake Forest, righty Rhett Lowder, was the second pitcher in the 2023 MLB draft behind Paul Skenes. The Reds also selected Lowder, though he and Burns never played together in college.\n\nNo. 1 draft pick Travis Bazzana (Cleveland Guardians/Oregon State) and third pick Charlie Condon (Colorado Rockies/Georgia) were universally regarded as the top two players in the draft. Consequently, either or both could surpass Chase Burns' bonus before the August 1 signing deadline. Burns' record-setting bonus of $9.25 million sets a high bar, but Bazzana and Condon's elite status might lead to even larger contracts.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sports Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_lynch@thesportsdaily.com", "name": "Colin Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Forest_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wake Forest University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_Lowder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhett Lowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://thesportsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/23375513.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745669", "eventUri": "eng-9745669", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2716, "textEnd": 2724}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Best stuff in the draft, slider may be the best pitch in the draft. Surpasses the $9.2 million Paul Skenes got from @Pirates last year.\"\n\nWhile the Reds' pitcher now owns the largest bonus in MLB Draft history, the largest up-front guarantee belongs to Stephen Strasburg, who signed a $15,107,104 contract ($7.5 million bonus) with the Nationals in 2009. Strasburg collected $19 million on that deal.\n\nBurns possesses perhaps two of the best pitches in the entire draft class, with a 65-grade fastball and 70-grade slider, according to MLB Pipeline. He regularly hits 100 miles per hour on his fastball and sat upper-90s as a junior in 2024.\n\nBurns finished his lone season with the Demon Deacons with a 2.70 earned-run average, striking out a ridiculous 191 batters in 100 innings pitched.

He's made great strides since we first saw him pitch 4 years ago and see him continuing on that same trajectory.\"\n\nReds' picking Chase Burns surprised many\n\nThe Reds made a bit of a surprising selection in the first round of the 2024 MLB Draft by selecting Burns out of Wake Forest with the No. 2 pick, hoping that the latest in the pipeline from the Deamon Deacons can become a big part of their talented young core in the future.\n\nAhead of the draft, the Reds were often mocked to take Charlie Condon, a third baseman/outfielder out of the Georgia baseball program. Condon went at the next pick to the Colorado Rockies.\n\nMock drafts often had the Rockies taking Chase Burns at the next pick. Instead, the Reds opted to go with Burns over Condon or another popular slugger in Jac Caglianone out of Florida, who fell to No. 6 where the Kansas City Royals took him.\n\nAs far as what the Reds are getting with Burns, they are hoping that the fastball velocity and strikeout rate from college translate to professional baseball, similar to Paul Skenes of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who they drafted out of LSU last year with the No. 1 overall pick. Burns can't be expected to make his way through the minor leagues as quickly as Paul Skenes, but he could eventually be a staff ace if he puts it all together with his tools.", "source": {"uri":

Burns' signing bonus will eclipse the previous record for the highest signing bonus in draft history ($9 million), which was established last summer by Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander Paul Skenes.\n\nIt's worth noting that slot value for the No. 2 slot was $9.785 million, meaning the Reds technically still signed Burns to an underslot agreement. In turn, they'll be able to use those savings elsewhere in their draft class.\n\nHere's a look at the 10 richest signing bonuses in MLB draft history:\n\nChase Burns, 2024, Reds, $9.25 millionPaul Skenes, 2023, Pirates, $9.2 millionDylan Crews, 2023, Nationals, $9 millionSpencer Torkelson, 2020, Tigers, $8.42 millionJackson Holliday, 2022, Orioles, $8.19 millionDruw Jones, 2022, Diamondbacks, $8.19 millionAdley Rutschman, 2019, Orioles, $8.10 millionJack Leiter, 2021, Rangers, $7.92 millionBobby Witt Jr., 2019, Royals, $7.79 millionCasey Mize, 2018, Tigers, $7.50 million\n\nComing into the draft, CBS Sports ranked Burns as the third-best prospect in the class. Here's what we wrote at the time:\n\nBack in February, we posed this question: \"Can Burns, plus Wake Forest's genius pitching development crew (led by biomechanist Dr. Kristen Nicholson), equal this year's Paul Skenes?\" Sure enough, Burns broadly followed the Skenes arc, transferring to another program ahead of his draft year and better harnessing a power arsenal that should ensure an early selection. Burns averaged nearly two strikeouts per inning thanks to a high-grade arsenal that features a rising upper-90s fastball, a swing-and-miss bullet slider, and a curveball. (He also has a seldom-used changeup.) His delivery might make you think of Matt Garza, but these deuces aren't so wild: He reliably walked fewer than 8% of the batters he faced in college, including less than 6% of those he faced this year in ACC play. Burns has all the makings of a well-above-average starter, and it shouldn't come as a surprise if he becomes the first pitcher in this class to make their big-league debut.\n\nBurns is the highest selected player to reach an agreement so far. It's at least possible that Burns' hold on the record will be short-lived given that No. 1 pick Travis Bazzana (Guardians) and No. 3 pick Charlie Condon (Rockies) remain unsigned.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

MLB Pipeline's Jim Callis reports (on X) the the right-hander received a $9.25MM signing bonus. While that's a bit shy of the $9.79MM slot value, it's the largest signing bonus in draft history. Burns edges past the $9.2MM which Paul Skenes secured as last year's first overall pick.\n\nIt's possible that record will only stand for a few days. Burns is the first player from this year's top 10 to sign. First overall pick Travis Bazzana (and potentially #3 selection Charlie Condon) could land a loftier bonus in the coming weeks. That won't be of much concern to Burns, the first pitcher to come off the board last week. While Burns was widely expected to be the top pitcher selected, he was a slightly surprising pick at #2. Condon and West Virginia infielder JJ Wetherholt -- who \"slipped\" to the Cardinals at #7 -- were marginally ahead of Burns on most public rankings heading into the draft, largely because of the heightened injury risk for pitchers.\n\nESPN's Kiley McDaniel and Keith Law of the Athletic each had Burns as the #5 player in the class. FanGraphs slotted him sixth, while Baseball America ranked him fourth. All four publications had Burns and Arkansas lefty Hagen Smith as the top two pitchers in some order.\n\nBurns was a high-profile draft prospect as a high schooler back in 2021. Teams weren't willing to meet his asking price at the time, leading the 6'3'' righty to the University of Tennessee. Burns had two strong seasons in Knoxville and transferred to Wake Forest for his draft year. He started 16 times for the Demon Deacons, firing 100 innings with a 2.70 earned run average. Burns fanned nearly half the batters he faced and easily led Division I pitchers with 191 strikeouts. Smith was second in the nation with 161 punchouts. He kept his walk rate to a 7.7% clip and finished his college career with a 40% strikeout rate against a 7.6% walk percentage.\n\nWith that level of dominance, it's not surprising that prospect evaluators suggest Burns has a top-of-the-rotation ceiling. Reports credit him with an upper-90s fastball that can run as high as 100 or 101 MPH. That pitch and his wipeout slider have each gotten 70 or 80 grades on the 20-80 scouting scale. Burns' curveball and changeup are a bit behind the fastball/slider combination and scouting reports point to some effort in his delivery, but there's not much question about his ability to stick as a starter. Both Law and McDaniel note that he could move quickly through the minors.\n\nCincinnati selected another Wake Forest righty, Rhett Lowder, in the top 10 a year ago. They're hopeful that duo will join Hunter Greene, Nick Lodolo and Andrew Abbott as part of a homegrown starting staff. There's injury risk with any group of young pitchers and the Reds will need more than five starters on an annual basis, but that quintet could be the nucleus of one of the sport's best rotations if things break right over the next couple seasons.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_franco@mlbtraderumors.com",

Skenes was the Pirates first round pick and the overall number one pick in the 2023 MLB first year player draft. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates set a record last season by paying No. 1 pick Paul Skenes a $9.2 million bonus to sign with them. That record wound up lasting only one year.\n\nWake Forest pitcher Chase Burns set a new record Thursday by agreeing to a $9.25 million signing bonus with the Cincinnati Reds, according to Kiley McDaniel of ESPN. The No. 2 overall pick in Sunday's draft became the first member of the class to sign.\n\nOn Friday, ESPN's Jeff Passan reported that No. 3 pick Charlie Condon was signing with the Colorado Rockies for the same bonus.\n\nThis new record could still be broken by Aug. 1. No. 1 pick Travis Bazzana was seen as one of the two best players in the draft alongside Condon, and could still surpass the $9.25 million bonus.\n\nThis is not necessarily an indication that the Reds -- or anyone else -- sees Burns as a superior prospect to Skenes. MLB teams are assigned bonus pools based on a variety of factors, and as long as revenue continues to increase, the bonuses will as well. For instance, the slot value for the Reds' pick was $9,785,000, so the team is actually signing Burns at something of a discount.\n\nSkenes absolutely obliterated the old record last year when he signed with the Pirates.

The previous record for the highest signing bonus in draft history ($9 million), which was established last summer by Pittsburgh Pirates right-hander Paul Skenes.\n\nHere's a look at the 10 richest signing bonuses in MLB draft history:\n\nChase Burns, 2024, Reds, $9.25 millionCharlie Condon, 2024, Rockies, $9.25 millionPaul Skenes, 2023, Pirates, $9.2 millionDylan Crews, 2023, Nationals, $9 millionTravis Bazzana, 2024, Guardians, $8.95 millionSpencer Torkelson, 2020, Tigers, $8.42 millionJackson Holliday, 2022, Orioles, $8.19 millionDruw Jones, 2022, Diamondbacks, $8.19 millionAdley Rutschman, 2019, Orioles, $8.10 millionJack Leiter, 2021, Rangers, $7.92 million\n\nComing into the draft, CBS Sports ranked Burns as the third-best prospect in the class. Here's what we wrote at the time:\n\nBack in February, we posed this question: \"Can Burns, plus Wake Forest's genius pitching development crew (led by biomechanist Dr. Kristen Nicholson), equal this year's Paul Skenes?\" Sure enough, Burns broadly followed the Skenes arc, transferring to another program ahead of his draft year and better harnessing a power arsenal that should ensure an early selection. Burns averaged nearly two strikeouts per inning thanks to a high-grade arsenal that features a rising upper-90s fastball, a swing-and-miss bullet slider, and a curveball. (He also has a seldom-used changeup.) His delivery might make you think of Matt Garza, but these deuces aren't so wild: He reliably walked fewer than 8% of the batters he faced in college, including less than 6% of those he faced this year in ACC play. Burns has all the makings of a well-above-average starter, and it shouldn't come as a surprise if he becomes the first pitcher in this class to make their big-league debut.\n\nWe also ranked Condon as the No. 1 player in the class. here's what we wrote:\n\nCondon came into the season perceived as a second-tier collegiate who needed a big spring to cement his spot in the top 10. He more than delivered. He led the NCAA in batting average, slugging percentage, and home runs (his 37 established a new BBCOR Era record). Oh, and he did all that while picking up third base and instilling the belief that that's where he should begin his career. The selling point here is still the bat. Condon, listed at 6-foot-6, possesses big-time strength and the ability to reliably hammer the ball. Additionally, he seldom whiffed; he chased outside the zone less often than some of his powerful peers, like Braden Montgomery and Jac Caglianone; and his batted-ball profile aligned with the current lift-and-pull trend -- that is to say, you can call him Sephiroth with how frequently he takes aim at a cloud. Factor in how Condon survived two years of SEC vetting, and we're comfortable declaring him to be the best player in the class -- even if he doesn't necessarily end up going No. 1 overall.\n\nNo. 1 pick Travis Bazzana also signed on Friday, albeit for just under $9 million.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

White, 39, was her \"beacon of light\" and she didn't want him to be \"just another statistic.\"\n\nDefense lawyer Scott King said the crime was fueled by alcohol and his client didn't remember it.

Although parts of his past were \"not pretty,\" Burns accepted responsibility and was \"capable of moving forward with his life\" without being \"warehoused\" in prison.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor Jacquelyn Altpeter asked for six years in prison.

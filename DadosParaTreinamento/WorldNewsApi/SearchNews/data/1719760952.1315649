United want a new starting centre back to replace Raphael Varane and are expected to be in the market for another defender amid plans to sell Victor Lindelof. It is uncertain if Jonny Evans, out of contract next month, will sign a new renewal. Branthwaite could make his England debut next month and be included in Gareth Southgate's final 26-man squad for the European Championship. He received his first senior call-up for March's friendlies against Brazil and Belgium but didn't feature off the bench. The 21-year-old signed a new Everton deal until 2027 in October and the length of his contract, age, position and nationality have protected Branthwaite's resale value. Branthwaite has also not agitated to leave. Despite uncertainty over the future ownership of Everton, the club will not sell Branthwaite for a cut-price fee and value him at between \u00a370million-\u00a380m.

United have not made a formal approach for Branthwaite. Everton sources have noted the parallels between United's signing of Harry Maguire for \u00a380m in 2019 and their interest in Branthwaite. United were reeling from their worst defensive record in 40 years and had failed to qualify for the Champions League when they made Maguire the most expensive defender in the game's history. United have recruited a centre back in five of the last eight summer transfer windows but Martinez is the only one effectively assured of staying next season. The 26-year-old managed a meagre 14 appearances this season due to metatarsal, medial collateral ligament and calf injuries but excelled in the FA Cup final triumph over City. Maguire, 31, is out of contract next year though United have the option of an additional year. The former club captain had a commendable campaign after a \u00a330m move to West Ham collapsed in August. Branthwaite started in 41 of Everton's 45 games in 2023-24, having played 36 times on loan at PSV Eindhoven the previous season.", "summary": "Jarrad Branthwaite could make his England debut next month and be included in Gareth Southgate's 26-man squad for Euro 2024.", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/everton-stance-manchester-united-transfer-29258145", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29258216.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2070693913.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:32:10", "author": "Samuel Luckhurst", "authors": ["Samuel Luckhurst"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.065}

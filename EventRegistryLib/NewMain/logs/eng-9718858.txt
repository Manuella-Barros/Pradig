Instead, he lost the U.S. Open to Bryson DeChambeau that Father's Day evening in North Carolina.\n\nNow, McIlroy is back in Scotland where in 2023 he actually birdied the final two holes to win in a thrilling finish.\n\nThe second-ranked golfer in the world is hoping that same magic returns in Scotland, as there's never been a back-to-back champion in the 52-year history of the tournament.\n\nMcIlroy heads into Thursday's first round at the par-70, 7,237-yard Tom Doak course, nestled between iconic Open Championship courses North Berwick and Muirfield, as the favorite to repeat, sitting at +700.\n\nNot far behind is this year's PGA Champion and the No. 3-ranked golfer in the world Xander Schauffele at +800.\n\nThose two will be joined by eight other top-15 golfers in the world and more than 70 PGA Tour pros this week at The Renaissance Club, as the British Open will follow next week at Royal Troon.\n\nFrontPageBets takes a look at the golfers to watch in this week's Genesis Scottish Open.\n\nBest Sportsbooks For Scottish Open Betting - 2024\n\n2024 Scottish Open predictions: Rory McIlroy to win (+700)\n\nPerhaps one of the most competitive golfers on Tour, you can bet McIlroy has spent the past month replaying the final three holes of the U.S. Open over and over again in his head, waiting for a chance to redeem himself.\n\nAnd if anyone can - and should - it's McIlroy.\n\nSure, the 26-time PGA Tour winner and four-time major champion hasn't won a major in a decade. But he has finished runner-up four times in majors since 2018 and has 18 top-5 finishes since 2015, including finishing inside the top 8 in all four majors of 2022.\n\nHe rebounded from missing the cut in the 2023 Masters with a T7 at the PGA Championship that season, then followed up with second at the U.S. Open and a T6 at the Open Championship.\n\nThe last four U.S. Opens he's played, his worst finish was T8 in 2021.\n\nLast year was his first visit to The Renaissance Club, where he won with that spectacular birdie-birdie finish in the final round, which came off a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.\n\nScottish Open prop bets: Ludvig Aberg Top 10 (+180)\n\nTurning pro just last year, the 24-year-old Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAnd it's no surprise, since the young Swede has game.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Aberg has 10 top-25 finishes, including six top-10s, two of which he finished second.\n\nOh, and those runner-up finishes were at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Masters. By the way, this year's Masters was the first-ever major for Aberg.\n\nAfter missing the cut at the PGA Championship at Valhalla in May, he went on to finish T12 at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nAberg game is solid all the way round, as he's eighth in Strokes Gained: Total (1.236) and ninth in SG: Approach to Green (0.587). He's also third in total driving.\n\nLast year, Aberg missed the cut in his first Scottish Open appearance.\n\nGenesis Scottish Open longshot pick: Aaron Rai (+5000)\n\nWhile Rai is still looking for his first PGA Tour win, he's not far off.\n\nIn four of his last eight starts, the 29-year-old Englishman hasn't finished outside the top 15, including a T2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic two weeks ago in Detroit and a T7 outing last week at the John Deere Classic.\n\nIn those last two tournaments, Rai, who is No. 53 in the OWGR, is a combined 38-under par, with two rounds of 65 and one 63 sprinkled in.\n\nRai is currently fifth on the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Total (1.316) and seventh in Strokes Gained: Approach to Green (0.696).\n\n2024 Genesis Scottish Open odds\n\nRory McIlroy +700Xander Schauffele +800Collin Morikawa +1400Ludvig Aberg +1800Tommy Fleetwood +1800Viktor Hovland +2200Tom Kim +2500Hideki Matsuyama +2800Min Woo Lee +2800\n\nGambling problem?

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nRory McIlroy is back.\n\nFor the first time since the U.S. Open in mid-June, the face of golf will tee it up at The Renaissance Club this week to defend his Scottish Open title.\n\nMcIlroy, who missed two par putts of 4 feet or less in the final three holes at Pinehurst No. 2, including what might have put him in at least a playoff on the 72nd hole, hasn't played competitively since.\n\nCollapsing down the stretch with a 1-shot lead heading into 16 on Sunday was perhaps the biggest heartbreaking letdown of his career, as McIlroy was trying to win his first major championship in 10 years. Instead, he lost the U.S. Open to Bryson DeChambeau that Father's Day evening in North Carolina.\n\nNow, McIlroy is back in Scotland where in 2023 he actually birdied the final two holes to win in a thrilling finish.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But he has finished runner-up four times in majors since 2018 and has 18 top-5 finishes since 2015, including finishing inside the top 8 in all four majors of 2022.\n\nHe rebounded from missing the cut in the 2023 Masters with a T7 at the PGA Championship that season, then followed up with second at the U.S. Open and a T6 at the Open Championship.\n\nThe last four U.S. Opens he's played, his worst finish was T8 in 2021.\n\nLast year was his first visit to The Renaissance Club, where he won with that spectacular birdie-birdie finish in the final round, which came off a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.\n\nScottish Open prop bets: Ludvig Aberg Top 10 (+180)\n\nTurning pro just last year, the 24-year-old Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAnd it's no surprise, since the young Swede has game.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Aberg has 10 top-25 finishes, including six top-10s, two of which he finished second.\n\nOh, and those runner-up finishes were at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Masters.

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nRory McIlroy is back.\n\nFor the first time since the U.S. Open in mid-June, the face of golf will tee it up at The Renaissance Club this week to defend his Scottish Open title.\n\nMcIlroy, who missed two par putts of 4 feet or less in the final three holes at Pinehurst No. 2, including what might have put him in at least a playoff on the 72nd hole, hasn't played competitively since.\n\nCollapsing down the stretch with a 1-shot lead heading into 16 on Sunday was perhaps the biggest heartbreaking letdown of his career, as McIlroy was trying to win his first major championship in 10 years. Instead, he lost the U.S. Open to Bryson DeChambeau that Father's Day evening in North Carolina.\n\nNow, McIlroy is back in Scotland where in 2023 he actually birdied the final two holes to win in a thrilling finish.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Now what?\n\nThe second-ranked golfer in the world is hoping that same magic returns in Scotland, as there's never been a back-to-back champion in the 52-year history of the tournament.\n\nMcIlroy heads into Thursday's first round at the par-70, 7,237-yard Tom Doak course, nestled between iconic Open Championship courses North Berwick and Muirfield, as the favorite to repeat, sitting at +700.\n\nNot far behind is this year's PGA Champion and the No. 3-ranked golfer in the world Xander Schauffele at +800.\n\nThose two will be joined by eight other top-15 golfers in the world and more than 70 PGA Tour pros this week at The Renaissance Club, as the British Open will follow next week at Royal Troon.\n\nFrontPageBets takes a look at the golfers to watch in this week's Genesis Scottish Open.\n\nBest Sportsbooks For Scottish Open Betting - 2024 2024 Scottish Open predictions: Rory McIlroy to win (+700)\n\nPerhaps one of the most competitive golfers on Tour, you can bet McIlroy has spent the past month replaying the final three holes of the U.S. Open over and over again in his head, waiting for a chance to redeem himself.\n\nAnd if anyone can - and should - it's McIlroy.\n\nSure, the 26-time PGA Tour winner and four-time major champion hasn't won a major in a decade. But he has finished runner-up four times in majors since 2018 and has 18 top-5 finishes since 2015, including finishing inside the top 8 in all four majors of 2022.\n\nHe rebounded from missing the cut in the 2023 Masters with a T7 at the PGA Championship that season, then followed up with second at the U.S. Open and a T6 at the Open Championship.\n\nThe last four U.S. Opens he's played, his worst finish was T8 in 2021.\n\nLast year was his first visit to The Renaissance Club, where he won with that spectacular birdie-birdie finish in the final round, which came off a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.\n\nScottish Open prop bets: Ludvig Aberg Top 10 (+180)\n\nTurning pro just last year, the 24-year-old Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAnd it's no surprise, since the young Swede has game.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Aberg has 10 top-25 finishes, including six top-10s, two of which he finished second.\n\nOh, and those runner-up finishes were at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Masters. By the way, this year's Masters was the first-ever major for Aberg.\n\nAfter missing the cut at the PGA Championship at Valhalla in May, he went on to finish T12 at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nAberg game is solid all the way round, as he's eighth in Strokes Gained: Total (1.236) and ninth in SG: Approach to Green (0.587). He's also third in total driving.\n\nLast year, Aberg missed the cut in his first Scottish Open appearance.\n\nGenesis Scottish Open longshot pick: Aaron Rai (+5000)\n\nWhile Rai is still looking for his first PGA Tour win, he's not far off.\n\nIn four of his last eight starts, the 29-year-old Englishman hasn't finished outside the top 15, including a T2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic two weeks ago in Detroit and a T7 outing last week at the John Deere Classic.\n\nIn those last two tournaments, Rai, who is No. 53 in the OWGR, is a combined 38-under par, with two rounds of 65 and one 63 sprinkled in.\n\nRai is currently fifth on the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Total (1.316) and seventh in Strokes Gained: Approach to Green (0.696).\n\n2024 Genesis Scottish Open oddsRory McIlroy +700Xander Schauffele +800Collin Morikawa +1400Ludvig Aberg +1800Tommy Fleetwood +1800Viktor Hovland +2200Tom Kim +2500Hideki Matsuyama +2800Min Woo Lee +2800\n\nGambling problem?

Instead, he lost the U.S. Open to Bryson DeChambeau that Father's Day evening in North Carolina.\n\nNow, McIlroy is back in Scotland where in 2023 he actually birdied the final two holes to win in a thrilling finish.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nJohn Deere closes on land for 1.2 million-square-foot Indiana warehouse Man shot outside bar in downtown Waterloo Ag expert: Deere prepares for future losses due to downturned ag economy Woman dead in single-vehicle accident Woman identified in fatal crash Waterloo man arrested after alleged assault at Sunnyside County Club Woman arrested for assaulting multiple people, punching officer, ramming property in Waterloo Restaurant inspection update: Grimy blenders, mouse droppings and bad sushi Firecracker Fourth of July celebrations planned throughout Cedar Valley Drivers urged to slow down or steer clear of construction zone John Eveland: Waterloo businessman makes lasting impact in Cedar Valley community Bond remains same in pre-teen sex sting in Evansdale Child shot while playing at Waterloo's Lafayette Park Sunday night College Football: Cedar Falls OL, second Tiger commits to Northern Iowa football program Plainfield man arrested for lascivious conduct with female minor\n\nThe second-ranked golfer in the world is hoping that same magic returns in Scotland, as there's never been a back-to-back champion in the 52-year history of the tournament.\n\nMcIlroy heads into Thursday's first round at the par-70, 7,237-yard Tom Doak course, nestled between iconic Open Championship courses North Berwick and Muirfield, as the favorite to repeat, sitting at +700.\n\nNot far behind is this year's PGA Champion and the No. 3-ranked golfer in the world Xander Schauffele at +800.\n\nThose two will be joined by eight other top-15 golfers in the world and more than 70 PGA Tour pros this week at The Renaissance Club, as the British Open will follow next week at Royal Troon.\n\nFrontPageBets takes a look at the golfers to watch in this week's Genesis Scottish Open.\n\nBest Sportsbooks For Scottish Open Betting - 2024\n\n2024 Scottish Open predictions: Rory McIlroy to win (+700)\n\nPerhaps one of the most competitive golfers on Tour, you can bet McIlroy has spent the past month replaying the final three holes of the U.S. Open over and over again in his head, waiting for a chance to redeem himself.\n\nAnd if anyone can - and should - it's McIlroy.\n\nSure, the 26-time PGA Tour winner and four-time major champion hasn't won a major in a decade. But he has finished runner-up four times in majors since 2018 and has 18 top-5 finishes since 2015, including finishing inside the top 8 in all four majors of 2022.\n\nHe rebounded from missing the cut in the 2023 Masters with a T7 at the PGA Championship that season, then followed up with second at the U.S. Open and a T6 at the Open Championship.\n\nThe last four U.S. Opens he's played, his worst finish was T8 in 2021.\n\nLast year was his first visit to The Renaissance Club, where he won with that spectacular birdie-birdie finish in the final round, which came off a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.\n\nScottish Open prop bets: Ludvig Aberg Top 10 (+180)\n\nTurning pro just last year, the 24-year-old Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAnd it's no surprise, since the young Swede has game.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Aberg has 10 top-25 finishes, including six top-10s, two of which he finished second.\n\nOh, and those runner-up finishes were at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Masters. By the way, this year's Masters was the first-ever major for Aberg.\n\nAfter missing the cut at the PGA Championship at Valhalla in May, he went on to finish T12 at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nAberg game is solid all the way round, as he's eighth in Strokes Gained: Total (1.236) and ninth in SG: Approach to Green (0.587). He's also third in total driving.\n\nLast year, Aberg missed the cut in his first Scottish Open appearance.\n\nGenesis Scottish Open longshot pick: Aaron Rai (+5000)\n\nWhile Rai is still looking for his first PGA Tour win, he's not far off.\n\nIn four of his last eight starts, the 29-year-old Englishman hasn't finished outside the top 15, including a T2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic two weeks ago in Detroit and a T7 outing last week at the John Deere Classic.\n\nIn those last two tournaments, Rai, who is No. 53 in the OWGR, is a combined 38-under par, with two rounds of 65 and one 63 sprinkled in.\n\nRai is currently fifth on the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Total (1.316) and seventh in Strokes Gained: Approach to Green (0.696).\n\n2024 Genesis Scottish Open odds\n\nRory McIlroy +700Xander Schauffele +800Collin Morikawa +1400Ludvig Aberg +1800Tommy Fleetwood +1800Viktor Hovland +2200Tom Kim +2500Hideki Matsuyama +2800Min Woo Lee +2800\n\nGambling problem?

But he has finished runner-up four times in majors since 2018 and has 18 top-5 finishes since 2015, including finishing inside the top 8 in all four majors of 2022.\n\nHe rebounded from missing the cut in the 2023 Masters with a T7 at the PGA Championship that season, then followed up with second at the U.S. Open and a T6 at the Open Championship.\n\nThe last four U.S. Opens he's played, his worst finish was T8 in 2021.\n\nLast year was his first visit to The Renaissance Club, where he won with that spectacular birdie-birdie finish in the final round, which came off a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.\n\nScottish Open prop bets: Ludvig Aberg Top 10 (+180)\n\nTurning pro just last year, the 24-year-old Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAnd it's no surprise, since the young Swede has game.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Aberg has 10 top-25 finishes, including six top-10s, two of which he finished second.\n\nOh, and those runner-up finishes were at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Masters. By the way, this year's Masters was the first-ever major for Aberg.\n\nAfter missing the cut at the PGA Championship at Valhalla in May, he went on to finish T12 at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nAberg game is solid all the way round, as he's eighth in Strokes Gained: Total (1.236) and ninth in SG: Approach to Green (0.587). He's also third in total driving.\n\nLast year, Aberg missed the cut in his first Scottish Open appearance.\n\nGenesis Scottish Open longshot pick: Aaron Rai (+5000)\n\nWhile Rai is still looking for his first PGA Tour win, he's not far off.\n\nIn four of his last eight starts, the 29-year-old Englishman hasn't finished outside the top 15, including a T2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic two weeks ago in Detroit and a T7 outing last week at the John Deere Classic.\n\nIn those last two tournaments, Rai, who is No. 53 in the OWGR, is a combined 38-under par, with two rounds of 65 and one 63 sprinkled in.\n\nRai is currently fifth on the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Total (1.316) and seventh in Strokes Gained: Approach to Green (0.696).\n\n2024 Genesis Scottish Open oddsRory McIlroy +700Xander Schauffele +800Collin Morikawa +1400Ludvig Aberg +1800Tommy Fleetwood +1800Viktor Hovland +2200Tom Kim +2500Hideki Matsuyama +2800Min Woo Lee +2800\n\nGambling problem?

Instead, he lost the U.S. Open to Bryson DeChambeau that Father's Day evening in North Carolina.\n\nNow, McIlroy is back in Scotland where in 2023 he actually birdied the final two holes to win in a thrilling finish.\n\nPeople are also reading... 3 dead in plane crash near McDowell, Rutherford county line Plane crashes in McDowell; emergency crews ask people to avoid Brackett Town Road Marion man meets McDowell paramedic who saved his life 24 years ago Toddler killed by truck at Steel Creek campground north of Morganton Body found Sunday was Marion man; cause of death pending toxicology report Golden Hour Charcuterie opens in Marion's Depot District Nebo woman charged with break-in Man found dead near Lake James in McDowell County McDowell Little League crowns two champions; league to host a baseball state tournament Burkemont Mountain in Morganton ablaze with 30-acre wildfire When are the 4th of July fireworks, parades in McDowell County?

But he has finished runner-up four times in majors since 2018 and has 18 top-5 finishes since 2015, including finishing inside the top 8 in all four majors of 2022.\n\nHe rebounded from missing the cut in the 2023 Masters with a T7 at the PGA Championship that season, then followed up with second at the U.S. Open and a T6 at the Open Championship.\n\nThe last four U.S. Opens he's played, his worst finish was T8 in 2021.\n\nLast year was his first visit to The Renaissance Club, where he won with that spectacular birdie-birdie finish in the final round, which came off a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.\n\nScottish Open prop bets: Ludvig Aberg Top 10 (+180)\n\nTurning pro just last year, the 24-year-old Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAnd it's no surprise, since the young Swede has game.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Aberg has 10 top-25 finishes, including six top-10s, two of which he finished second.\n\nOh, and those runner-up finishes were at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Masters. By the way, this year's Masters was the first-ever major for Aberg.\n\nAfter missing the cut at the PGA Championship at Valhalla in May, he went on to finish T12 at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nAberg game is solid all the way round, as he's eighth in Strokes Gained: Total (1.236) and ninth in SG: Approach to Green (0.587). He's also third in total driving.\n\nLast year, Aberg missed the cut in his first Scottish Open appearance.\n\nGenesis Scottish Open longshot pick: Aaron Rai (+5000)\n\nWhile Rai is still looking for his first PGA Tour win, he's not far off.\n\nIn four of his last eight starts, the 29-year-old Englishman hasn't finished outside the top 15, including a T2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic two weeks ago in Detroit and a T7 outing last week at the John Deere Classic.\n\nIn those last two tournaments, Rai, who is No. 53 in the OWGR, is a combined 38-under par, with two rounds of 65 and one 63 sprinkled in.\n\nRai is currently fifth on the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Total (1.316) and seventh in Strokes Gained: Approach to Green (0.696).\n\n2024 Genesis Scottish Open oddsRory McIlroy +700Xander Schauffele +800Collin Morikawa +1400Ludvig Aberg +1800Tommy Fleetwood +1800Viktor Hovland +2200Tom Kim +2500Hideki Matsuyama +2800Min Woo Lee +2800\n\nGambling problem?

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nRory McIlroy is back.\n\nFor the first time since the U.S. Open in mid-June, the face of golf will tee it up at The Renaissance Club this week to defend his Scottish Open title.\n\nMcIlroy, who missed two par putts of 4 feet or less in the final three holes at Pinehurst No. 2, including what might have put him in at least a playoff on the 72nd hole, hasn't played competitively since.\n\nCollapsing down the stretch with a 1-shot lead heading into 16 on Sunday was perhaps the biggest heartbreaking letdown of his career, as McIlroy was trying to win his first major championship in 10 years. Instead, he lost the U.S. Open to Bryson DeChambeau that Father's Day evening in North Carolina.\n\nNow, McIlroy is back in Scotland where in 2023 he actually birdied the final two holes to win in a thrilling finish.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nPi Pizzeria closing last remaining location, in St. Louis' Central West End McClellan: Downtown St. Louis is a casualty of the do-gooder war Hulk Hogan starts selling his new Real American Beer in Missouri, competing with Bud Light BenFred: Why Jordan Walker's name will provide hot-stove fodder as Cardinals near trade deadline Wentzville schools investigated board members for alleged retaliation, ethics violations Parades, fireworks and parties: Your guide to July 4th in St. Louis Tropical Storm Beryl could hit St. Louis area with 4 inches of rain or more Several St. Louis-area cities move fireworks shows to Friday.

But he has finished runner-up four times in majors since 2018 and has 18 top-5 finishes since 2015, including finishing inside the top 8 in all four majors of 2022.\n\nHe rebounded from missing the cut in the 2023 Masters with a T7 at the PGA Championship that season, then followed up with second at the U.S. Open and a T6 at the Open Championship.\n\nThe last four U.S. Opens he's played, his worst finish was T8 in 2021.\n\nLast year was his first visit to The Renaissance Club, where he won with that spectacular birdie-birdie finish in the final round, which came off a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.\n\nScottish Open prop bets: Ludvig Aberg Top 10 (+180)\n\nTurning pro just last year, the 24-year-old Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAnd it's no surprise, since the young Swede has game.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Aberg has 10 top-25 finishes, including six top-10s, two of which he finished second.\n\nOh, and those runner-up finishes were at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Masters. By the way, this year's Masters was the first-ever major for Aberg.\n\nAfter missing the cut at the PGA Championship at Valhalla in May, he went on to finish T12 at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nAberg game is solid all the way round, as he's eighth in Strokes Gained: Total (1.236) and ninth in SG: Approach to Green (0.587). He's also third in total driving.\n\nLast year, Aberg missed the cut in his first Scottish Open appearance.\n\nGenesis Scottish Open longshot pick: Aaron Rai (+5000)\n\nWhile Rai is still looking for his first PGA Tour win, he's not far off.\n\nIn four of his last eight starts, the 29-year-old Englishman hasn't finished outside the top 15, including a T2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic two weeks ago in Detroit and a T7 outing last week at the John Deere Classic.\n\nIn those last two tournaments, Rai, who is No. 53 in the OWGR, is a combined 38-under par, with two rounds of 65 and one 63 sprinkled in.\n\nRai is currently fifth on the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Total (1.316) and seventh in Strokes Gained: Approach to Green (0.696).\n\n2024 Genesis Scottish Open odds\n\nRory McIlroy +700Xander Schauffele +800Collin Morikawa +1400Ludvig Aberg +1800Tommy Fleetwood +1800Viktor Hovland +2200Tom Kim +2500Hideki Matsuyama +2800Min Woo Lee +2800\n\nGambling problem?

You can find evidence of that by looking at the wide array of winning scores at the Renaissance Club. Schauffele won here in 2022 with a score of 7 under par while Bernd Wiesberger won it in a playoff in 2019 at 22 under par.\n\nWith the forecast not calling for a ton of wind this week, I'm going to predict the winning score to be one shot lower than it was when McIlroy won here in 2023. With that being said, I could end up being way off if the wind picks up on the weekend.\n\nMcIlroy is the most fascinating golfer this week. He's the defending champion and was in peak form before allowing the U.S. Open to slip through his grasp a few short weeks ago. After that, he withdrew from the Travelers Championship meaning this will be the first time we'll see him in action since the heartbreaking loss.\n\nMcIlroy may need this event to help get shake off another major loss. I expect him to have a solid performance, but won't be truly in contention on Sunday. The time to bet on him may be next week at the Open Championship.\n\nXander Schauffele has been statistically the second best golfer on the PGA Tour this season next to Scottie Scheffler and now he returns to an event he won in 2022. Despite winning the PGA Championship, the question surrounding his ability to close out tournaments on the back nine on a Sunday still lingers.\n\nHe'll post yet another top-10 finish, but I don't think he ends up winning this event for the second time in three years.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see how Ludvig Aberg fares playing links golf the next two weeks. He won the Omega European Masters back in September and has skyrocketed up the world rankings since then. Can he keep his momentum going back in Europe? I expect a solid finish, but I need to see him step up on a Sunday before I'll take him to win a big event.\n\nIt's worth noting he missed the cut here last season.\n\nCollin Morikawa is looking like he's back to his former self, like when he won the 2021 Open Championship. He has finished inside the the top 20 in six straight starts and should be in a good position to compete this weekend. With that being said, he hasn't been able to convert 54-hole leads into wins so far in 2024, which gives me concern when it comes to him closing things out on Sunday.\n\nTommy Fleetwood has had plenty of success on links courses in Europe, including the Scottish Open. He has finished inside the top six in three of the last four years including a runner-up finish in 2020. Is he in good enough form to truly compete this week? I'm not so sure.\n\nI'm out on Viktor Hovland until he proves me wrong. He has been unimpressive all season and he doesn't have a good finish at the Scottish Open in his career either, missing the cut here in 2022 and finishing 25th last year. I'm afraid another missed cut at this event could be in his future.\n\nTom Kim's history at the Scottish Open, which includes a solo third place finish in 2022 and a T6 finish here last year, is impressive. With that being said, I don't trust his form heading into this week. He missed the cut at the Rocket Mortgage Classic, losing over a stroke per round with his approach game. He'll make the cut, but won't be in the mix on the weekend.\n\nIf you read my betting preview, you'd know that Min Woo Lee is my best bet to win this week. He won the 2021 Scottish Open and seems to be peaking at the perfect time, finishing T2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic. He thrives when playing links golf and I think he has a great chance to win this event for the second time in his career.\n\nMatt Fitzpatrick missed the cut at the Scottish Open last year and don't be surprised if he misses it again in 2024. He has finished inside the top 35 just once in his last five starts, including a T36 finish at the Travelers Championship where he lost -0.6 true strokes per round with his approach game.\n\nI'd recommend staying far away from betting on Fitzy this week.\n\nHideki Matsuyama missed the cut in 2022, the only year he's teed it up at the Scottish Open.\n\nThis season, he's had a bit of an up-and-down campaign, missing plenty of events due to injury and while he has a win at the Genesis Invitational, he is coming into this week off a T23 performance at the Travelers Championship where he lost strokes with his approach play for just the fourth time in 2024.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

This post will continue our PGA Tour odds series as we hand out a Genesis Scottish Open prediction and pick. We will also let you know how to watch the event.\n\nThe Scottish Open is held at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick, Scotland. Last year, Rory McIlroy was able to take home the win after shooting 15-under par for the weekend. He was able to edge out the Scottish Robert McIntyre by one stroke.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind for this event is the weather. It does not get warm in Scotland as temperatures are not expected to be over 60 degrees. Along with that, Sunday has some rain forecasted, so being at the top on Sunday is going to be very important. With it being a little colder, the ball might not fly as far as it usually does. This means a shot that is usually a 7-iron might turn into a 6-iron.\n\nThe Renaissance Club is a par-70 course that comes in just over 7,200 yards. The three par-5's all come in over 590 yards, with one of the holes reaching 600 yards. The par-4's are not as bad, but there are still some long ones to be careful of. Of course hitting the fairway off the tee box is important, but being good with the irons is probably the most important aspect of the game this weekend.\n\nTime: Thursday start time at 2:15 AM ET/11:45 PM PT (Wednesday night)\n\nGenesis Scottish Open favorite picks\n\nRory McIlroy: McIlroy finally returns to the tee box after taking almost a month off. He finished second at the U.S Open behind Bryson DeChambeau, but abruptly left and decided to take a few weeks off. McIlroy is back now, and one can only assume he is feeling good. He has played well this season, and there is no reason to believe he will miss a beat. McIlroy crushes the ball off the tee, and he can land his irons pretty well. He has won here before, and it would not be shocking to see him do it again.\n\nXander Schauffele: Schauffele is second in the FedEx Cup rankings, and third in the OWGR. He has made every cut this season, and he has finished in the top-10 11 times. Schauffele has finished in the top-25 in 15 of his 16 starts this season, as well. Schauffele is 14th in greens in regulation, first in scrambling percentage, and second in scoring average. If he continues to play as he was, Schauffele will win in Scotland.\n\nLudvig Aberg: Aberg is eighth on tour in total strokes gained. He is ninth in strokes gained: approach to green. This means he is very good with his irons, which is going to be a huge help this weekend. Along with that, Aberg does a great job hitting fairways. He could be a little better on the greens, but with his iron and driver play, Aberg has a great chance to pull off the victory.\n\nGenesis Scottish Open sleeper picks\n\nSungjae Im: Im has played well in his last two starts, and that is important. He finished third at the Travelers Championship, and 12th at the John Deere Classic. Im has been good all season on and around the green. He needs to be better off the tee, but there has been some improvement in the last two events he has played. Im should be able to play well and finish towards the top of the leaderboard.\n\nRobert McIntyre: McIntyre finished second at the Scottish Open last season. He shot 14-under par, and 10-under on Saturday and Sunday. McIntyre is pretty good with his approach shots from short, but could use some work on his long irons. Along with that, he needs to hit more fairways. However, he won the RBC Canadian Open, and this is his home country. There is going to be some extra motivation for him this weekend.\n\nFinal Genesis Scottish Open prediction and pick\n\nThis is going to be a good weekend of golf. It is not easy for the golfers by any means, but it is competitive, and fun to watch. As for a winner, I am going to take Ludvig Aberg to win this event. I think he has been playing well, and I like his chances this weekend.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeing_ground", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teeing ground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McIntyre_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert McIntyre (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/adf322b4-3ec6-11ef-a29b-c60e4c3c05c1.avif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It is the type of course he grew up playing, giving him an advantage over the non-UK golfers.\n\nMcIlroy ranks first in driving distance, 28th in driving accuracy and 35th in shots gained in putting.

He has flourished on most links courses in the UK over the past few seasons, finishing T10 at The Open (Royal Liverpool GC) last year, T4 at The Open (St. Andrews Links - Old Course) in 2022, and second at The Open (Royal Portrush GC) in the 2019.\n\nPairing history with recent outings, Fleetwood has had some strong finishes since his T7 performance at Valero in early April; he has finished T26 or better in eight of his past nine tournaments.\n\nThis could be the week that makes him a first-time PGA Tour winner.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_norton@inquirer.com", "name": "Andrew Norton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davis Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_Players_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tournament Players Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Woo_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Min Woo Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Course_at_St_Andrews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Course at St Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Liverpool_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Liverpool Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/RgB4TqmPqrRnrvL9Hli2rVCO8_4=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/BT2VLXKVUFAERBYDJUU2X6WVFQ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It's well deserved, considering how consistent Schauffele has played in 2024, recording 11 top-ten finishes in 16 events, without missing a cut.\n\nRanked top-12 in strokes gained off-the-tee, on approach, and putting, Schauffele should bounce back from a T42 finish here a year ago. His past five finishes have seen four inside of the top-ten, sliding out to T13 at the Travelers Championship. A few weeks of rest should benefit the talented ball-striker to climb the leaderboard once again in Scotland.\n\nSecondary Options\n\nTom Kim\n\nTom Kim has recorded solo third and T6 finishes at this event over the last two years. The 22-year-old South Korean native went to a playoff against Scottie Scheffler at Travelers, before missing the cut at the Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nComing off of a week of much-needed rest, Kim, ranked 25th total driving, 44th hole proximity, and 28th in birdie average, is rounding into form late in the season ahead of a return to a course he's experienced a lot of success. Kim is a strong candidate to use in one-and-done leagues this week at Renaissance.\n\nMin Woo Lee\n\nMin Woo Lee won this event on the DP World Tour in 2021 and nearly forced a playoff at the Rocket Mortgage Classic a couple of weeks ago. The Aussie golfer ranks sixth for strokes gained: off-the-tee, second in total driving, and 46th in par 4 scoring average. His driver is undoubtedly his best weapon, so at an open course that invites and rewards long tee shots, Lee is another strong secondary option to deploy.\n\nSneaky Plays\n\nTommy Fleetwood\n\nEnglishman Tommy Fleetwood may not have had much success in wins on the PGA Tour but he's always played well on links courses throughout his career. A T6 finish here in 2023, with a previous T4 finish in 2022, is very encouraging.\n\nFleetwood is among the best golfers off-the-tee, around the green, and a solid putter. Playing on links courses in the elements is where he tends to separate himself, so if you're still holding onto him, don't hesitate to insert him at Renaissance Club this week.\n\nAaron Rai\n\nAaron Rai has been knocking on the door of his first PGA Tour outright win lately, contending into Sunday in back-to-back events at the Rocket Mortgage Classic and John Deere Classic.\n\nNow, ranked seventh in strokes gained: approaching the green, plus 31st off-the-tee, the 2020 Scottish Open winner is in good form returning to an event he won while competing on the DP World Tour. The putter is his biggest weakness, although he's shown strong improvement since the season began.\n\nFavorite One-And-Done: Tom Kim\n\nTom Kim is my favorite one-and-done golfer to roll out at Renaissance Club this week. His accurate driver and strong irons, combined with top-50 hole proximity and top-60 putting average, checks most of the boxes to navigating the hazards at this event.\n\nKim's confidence should remain high despite a missed cut at RMC, especially taking Scottie Scheffler to a playoff at Travelers. Two top-six finishes since 2022 at the Scottish Open should turn into three this week, making Kim my favorite golfer in survivor contests.", "source": {"uri": "fantasypros.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FantasyPros"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Woo_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Min Woo Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortinet_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortinet Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.fantasypros.com/wp-content/images/TomKim_PGA_ScottishOpen_1470x650FP/1470x650.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

This week the PGA Tour shifts to Scotland for the Scottish Open, the final stop before the British Open at Royal Troon. Here's how our model sees the event event shaping up:\n\n2024 Genesis Scottish Open Preview\n\nThe Scottish Open remains a collaboration between the DP World Tour and PGA Tour, and this year it'll be staged at Renaissance Club. It's not only a British Open tune-up, but also a world-class venue with a loaded field.\n\nDesigned by renowned architect Tom Doak and opened in 2008, Renaissance Club has swiftly gained acclaim. Located near North Berwick, Scotland, it stretches more than 7,300 yards. It should be a worthy test. Here are 10 players our model likes this week:\n\nKeyCompete's 2024 Genesis Scottish Open Power Rankings\n\n(Odds from DraftKings - place your weekly bets here)\n\nNo. 10 - Brian Harman (+5000): Known for his precision and short game prowess, Harman, a former Open champion, is a good fit here.\n\nNo. 9 - Viktor Hovland (+2200): Proficiency with irons and confident putting can't be overlooked. Just needs consistency.\n\nNo. 6 - Tommy Fleetwood (+2000): Fan favorite with a silky swing, creativity around the greens could be a differentiator.\n\nNo. 5 - Tom Kim (+2600): Tenacious and strategic, looks ready to win soon.\n\nNo. 4 - Ludvig Aberg (+1600): Fearless and still emerging. Like Kim, feels like he's going to win something big soon.\n\nNo. 3 - Collin Morikawa (+1400): Factored heavily into Masters and PGA Championship. Still a great bet at tough courses.\n\nNo. 2 - Rory McIlroy (+750): First event since U.S. Open heartbreak. Wouldn't be a surprise to see him storm to a palette-cleansing title.\n\nNo. 1 - Xander Schauffele (+850): Leading the pack with a balanced game and a knack for clutch performances. The PGA Championship winner could add another title to his season.\n\n2024 John Deere Classic Recap\n\nDavis Thompson's victory at the 2024 John Deere Classic was a confident win that highlighted his rising stature in professional golf. His final round performance, marked by strategic shot-making and clutch putts, turned into a comfortable, runaway win. It was quite a statment during a breakthrough win.\n\nKeycompete had a solid week that brought our season record to 120-71.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as 2024 Scottish Open Power Rankings: Rory McIlroy Returns, but Xander Schauffele Leads an Elite Field.", "source": {"uri": "thenewstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_stracka@thenewstribune.com", "name": "Jim Stracka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/pi36se/picture289887844/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/3eb755f7-5794-4e04-a1e6-b919734595ec", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The Scottish Open 2024 begins on Thursday at The Renaissance Club in North Berwick, Scotland, with the first tee times coming at 2 a.m. ET. Rory McIlroy is the defending Scottish Open champion.\n\nMcIlroy is the 13-2 favorite in the 2024 Scottish Open odds, followed by Xander Schauffele (15-2) and Collin Morikawa (12-1). This will be McIlroy's first tournament since his last missed putts cost him the 2023 U.S. Open, so is he worth including at this price, or are you better off going with a longshot? Before locking in your 2024 Scottish Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nSportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up well over $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the 2024 Scottish Open field locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Scottish Open predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the Scottish Open 2024: Hovland, the reigning FedEx Cup champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles and doesn't even crack the top 10. Hovland has managed to secure just one top-10 finish this season, a T-3 showing at the PGA Championship in May.\n\nHovland's struggles can be directly attributed to his inability to score. Despite ranking inside the top 10 in strokes gained: off the tee (0.671) and putting average (1.712), Hovland has a scoring average of 70.38 this season, which ranks 107th on the PGA Tour. He's also finished T-25 or worse in each of his last two starts at the Scottish Open, which doesn't bode well for Hovland's chances to finish on top of the leaderboard. See who else to fade here.\n\nAnother surprise: Justin Thomas, a 35-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. Thomas has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 31-year-old finished T-5 at the Travelers Championship for his second top-five result over his last eight tournaments. After a dismal 2023 PGA season he'd certainly like to forget about, Thomas is showing a resemblance to the 15-time PGA Tour winner this year.\n\nThomas' scrambling and second shots have gotten him out of some tough situations this year, whereas last year a rough first shot often compounded into a truly disappointing hole. He is ninth on the PGA Tour in strokes gained: Approach to Green (compared to 39th last year) and 10th in scrambling from the rough (compared to 99th last year). Thomas is 12th in birdie average, a significant improvement from finishing 46th in birdie average last year, and at 35-1 odds, the model likes Thomas' odds of becoming a 16-time PGA Tour winner. See who else to back here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Scottish Open picks\n\nThe model is targeting five other golfers in listed at 35-1 or higher in outright bets, including one massive triple-digit longshot.

The Scottish Open, which starts Thursday at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick and is followed by The Open Championship next week at Royal Troon, is as fun of a fortnight as we get these days in professional golf.\n\nThere are innumerable reasons this is the case, but there are five in particular that stand out when considering this stretch of summer golf.\n\nThis has not always been the case for the PGA Tour. It used to go straight off the John Deere Classic into The Open, but starting in 2022, it began co-sanctioning the Scottish Open alongside the European Tour.\n\nIt has been one way the PGA Tour's alliance (now framework agreement) with the European Tour has paid dividends and provided value. The European Tour has some awesome, historic tournaments to show off, and the PGA Tour can provide the fields. That is what has happened here with the Scottish Open, and it marks a wonderful stretch of golf in the middle of July.\n\nHere are five reasons these two weeks in Scotland are among the best in pro golf across the entire year.\n\n1. Different style of golf: Is it jarring to go from Silvis, Illinois, to North Berwick, Scotland? Absolutely. But it is such a nice reprieve to see the monotony of the domestic PGA Tour schedule broken up by some semi-links golf at Renaissance Club and then some true links golf at Royal Troon. For the most part, courses are not stars on the PGA Tour. But they should be. Or rather, they can be. This time of year proves that, and it adds depth and context to the tournaments that are being played.\n\n2. (Almost) all the stars: Scottie Scheffler will not be at the Scottish Open, but that is the only massive absence in this cast of characters. Players have started turning up at Wimbledon over the last several days as they begin to trickle in for what should be such a terrific few weeks. This is tantamount to the West Coast stretch when golfers play Torrey Pines and Pebble Beach back to back or TPC Scottsdale and Riviera, but it's not something we get for the majority of the year.\n\n3. Weather that engenders creativity: Remember that Rory McIlroy shot to win the Scottish Open over Robert MacIntyre with a birdie-birdie finish in 2023? It's not the type of shot that's seen in American golf because American golf does not bring about the same kind of weather. The wind was absolutely howling that day, and Rory hit a 2-iron about 75 yards shorter than he normally does right to a distance where he could win the tournament. Any conditions that stir up creativity and thoughtfulness in the best players is always a bonus and substantially improves the events that are being played.\n\n4. Open season: If you have been following for any length of time, you know how much I enjoy opens. Whether it's the Spanish Open, Scottish Open, Canadian Open, South African Open or The Open Championship itself, almost all of them have a historical weight that almost all other events do not. Part of that is their meritocratic nature -- anyone can theoretically play their way into and win these events -- which goes at least a little bit against the closed-off signature events that the Tour has chosen to highlight over the past two years.\n\nThis openness mixed with the natural romance of Scotland makes for an alluring, compelling two weeks of golf, and the bigger fields create the opportunities for showdowns like McIlroy-MacIntyre down the stretch last year at the Scottish Open. Perhaps not a fabulous matchup on paper, but it certainly became one when considering the implications of MacIntyre winning his home open and McIlroy trying to add to his illustrious resume.\n\n5. The sounds of summer: As No Laying Up pointed out last year after this video of McIlroy dropped, there is nothing like the sound of a flushed long iron on the hardpan Scottish turf. We'll get plenty of it over the next two weeks at the Renaissance Club and Royal Troon, and all of it should be wonderful.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Scottsdale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC Scottsdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riviera Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torrey Pines Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvis,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silvis, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Silvis, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South African Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_de_Espa\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open de Espa\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/08/30b101b6-8d73-42e2-859c-4a02684d9cb3/thumbnail/1200x675/0d9c84d049767f278f877f1ad0d7f9e4/rory-mcilroy-2023-scottish-open.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Play gets underway on Thursday at The Renaissance Club in North Berwick, Scotland. Rory McIlroy will be back to defend his title, and enters as the 7-1 betting favorite in the latest 2024 Scottish Open odds. Xander Schauffele, who won the 2022 Scottish Open and the 2024 PGA Championship, is listed at 8-1 and is likely the top threat to McIlroy in the 2024 Scottish Open field. The total 2024 Scottish Open purse is $9 million, with the winner's share listed as $1.58 million.\n\nOther 2024 Scottish Open top contenders include Collin Morikawa (12-1), Ludvig Aberg (14-1), Viktor Hovland (20-1), Tommy Fleetwood (22-1), Min Woo Lee (25-1), and Tom Kim (25-1). With one and done pools winding down for the year, it is imperative to nail your Scottish Open OAD picks. Before locking in your 2024 Scottish Open one and done picks, you need to see what SportsLine DFS pro and PGA expert Mike McClure has to say.\n\nThe One and Done format is growing in popularity. It has several noticeable similarities to NFL Survivor pools, with the main difference being entries are not eliminated with a bad week. Players pick one golfer per week and earn points based on their selected golfer's prize money for that tournament. Golfers can only be used once per season, and the point format makes nailing majors, signature events, and big money tournaments critical.\n\nMcClure is a DFS legend with over $2 million in career winnings, and he's been red-hot on his PGA picks dating back to the PGA Tour restart in June of 2020. McClure uses his proprietary simulation model to analyze the field and crush his golf picks.\n\nMcClure has been on fire with his One and Done picks in 2024. At The American Express he backed Justin Thomas, who finished in third place and took home $635,600. At the Genesis Invitational, McClure tabbed Patrick Cantlay, who finished in fourth place at the signature event, as his top OAD pick. At the Cognizant Classic, McClure's top one and done pick, Min Woo Lee, finished in a tie for second place. Finally, at the Arnold Palmer Invitation, another signature event, McClure recommended using Scottie Scheffler and Will Zalatoris. The Result: Scheffler won the event by five strokes, and Zalatoris finished in fourth place.\n\nHis hot steak continued at the Players Championship, where McClure again recommended using Scheffler (if was still available) and Xander Schauffele. Both players were in contention until the end, with Scheffler coming out with the win and Schauffele finishing in second place. Then, at the Valspar Championship, McClure listed Cameron Young, who finished in second place, as his top OAD pick.\n\nMore recently, at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, McClure recommended using 50-1 longshot Alex Noren in One and Done pools. Noren would go on to be in contention until the end, before finishing in third place, two strokes off the lead! And at the PGA Championship, McClure targeted Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa, who finished in third and fourth places, respectively. He targeted Morikawa again at the Memorial Tournament, where Morikawa finished second.\n\nFinally, at the U.S. Open, McClure's top two one and done picks were Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy. DeChambeau finished in first place and McIlroy in second. And at the Rocket Mortgage Classic, McClure was backing Aaron Rai, who finished T2.\n\nNow, McClure has his sights on the 2024 Scottish Open and just revealed his optimal One and Done picks. They are a must-see for any player looking for an edge in their One and Done pool. You can only see McClure's Genesis Scottish Open 2024 one and done picks at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 Scottish Open One and Done picks\n\nOne of McClure's top OAD picks this week is former Texas Tech standout Ludvig Aberg. The 24-year-old has had a breakout season in 2024, and is now widely considered to be one of the top golfers in the world. The world No. 4 has six top-10 finishes already in 2024, and continues to find himself near the top of the leaderboard when playing against elite fields. Aberg is currently in sixth place in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nAberg notched his first career PGA Tour victory at the RSM Classic in November, and he enters this week ranked highly in several key metrics. He ranks third on the PGA Tour in total driving, eighth in total strokes Gaines (1.236), ninth in strokes gained on approach (0.587), 12th in strokes gained tee-to-green (1.140), and 14th in strokes gained off-the-tee (0.532). Aberg has proven to be a threat to win any tournament he enters, and is one of the hottest players in the world heading into the Scottish Open. You can see who else to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make Genesis Scottish Open 2024 One and Done picks\n\nMcClure is also targeting another golfer for his 2024 Scottish Open one and done picks who has a long track record of success against elite competition.

This week the PGA Tour shifts to Scotland for the Scottish Open, the final stop before the British Open at Royal Troon. Here's how our model sees the event event shaping up:\n\nThe Scottish Open remains a collaboration between the DP World Tour and PGA Tour, and this year it'll be staged at Renaissance Club. It's not only a British Open tune-up, but also a world-class venue with a loaded field.\n\nDesigned by renowned architect Tom Doak and opened in 2008, Renaissance Club has swiftly gained acclaim. Located near North Berwick, Scotland, it stretches more than 7,300 yards. It should be a worthy test. Here are 10 players our model likes this week:\n\n(Odds from DraftKings - place your weekly bets here)\n\nNo. 10 - Brian Harman (+5000): Known for his precision and short game prowess, Harman, a former Open champion, is a good fit here.\n\nNo. 9 - Viktor Hovland (+2200): Proficiency with irons and confident putting can't be overlooked. Just needs consistency.\n\nNo. 6 - Tommy Fleetwood (+2000): Fan favorite with a silky swing, creativity around the greens could be a differentiator.\n\nNo. 5 - Tom Kim (+2600): Tenacious and strategic, looks ready to win soon.\n\nNo. 4 - Ludvig Aberg (+1600): Fearless and still emerging. Like Kim, feels like he's going to win something big soon.\n\nNo. 3 - Collin Morikawa (+1400): Factored heavily into Masters and PGA Championship. Still a great bet at tough courses.\n\nNo. 2 - Rory McIlroy (+750): First event since U.S. Open heartbreak. Wouldn't be a surprise to see him storm to a palette-cleansing title.\n\nNo. 1 - Xander Schauffele (+850): Leading the pack with a balanced game and a knack for clutch performances. The PGA Championship winner could add another title to his season.\n\nDavis Thompson's victory at the 2024 John Deere Classic was a confident win that highlighted his rising stature in professional golf. His final round performance, marked by strategic shot-making and clutch putts, turned into a comfortable, runaway win. It was quite a statment during a breakthrough win.\n\nKeycompete had a solid week that brought our season record to 120-71.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Harman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2184,h_1228,x_133,y_224/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j2c7rdvw5ebq3z2adj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

We've had quite a run of late and are hoping to re-start the winning ways this week.\n\nThis week: The Genesis Scottish Open is a co-sanctioned event between the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour, and also a great warm-up for next week when the season's last major, the Open, is played. A year ago, Rory McIlroy hit a brilliant two-iron into a gale to set up a winning shot on the final hole. He's back again, playing for the first time since the U.S. Open debacle and trying to become the first golfer to go back-to-back at the Scottish tournament. The course hosting the tournament is the Renaissance Club, which has been the home for the event for the last six years. The Tom Doak-designed course opened in 1997 and features something unusual for top Scotties courses - trees! Although they don't play a huge part in play on the course, they are ever-present. The elements will likely be the biggest factor to what a player shoots, with the weather not expected to get above 14 degrees and some strong winds and rain heading in for the weekend.\n\nHis first start back since his stumble at the U.S. Open, McIlroy comes in as the defending champion. Despite his loss at Pinehurst, McIlroy has not been outside the top 15 in his last six starts and sits in third spot in Strokes Gained: Total, a good indicator of all-around solid play. He finished 15 under here last year and will likely need that or even a bit more to get the job done this time.\n\nTommy Fleetwood +2000\n\nThe Englishman has been inside the top 26 in his last six starts, including a 15-place finish at the Travelers where he shot 66-65 on the weekend. In his last four appearances at this tournament, he's posted a tie for sixth, a tie for fourth and a runner-up finish. He's good value at this price.\n\nThe winner of this tournament two years ago, Schauffele also has a top 10 on his resume. Has not been outside the top 25 in his last 12 starts. In majors this year he's been eighth (Masters), winner (PGA) and tied for seventh (U.S. Open). He's second on the PGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Total.\n\nAaron Rai +400\n\nRai won this tournament back in 2020, but has missed the cut in his past two appearances. Still, his play of late has been good. He's been inside the top 20 in each of his last four starts, including a tie for second at the Rocket Mortgage Classic and a tie for seventh at last week's John Deere Classic. He sits seventh in Driving Accuracy and third in Greens in Regulation, a solid combination that leads to low scores.\n\nA winner here back in 2021 Lee has been inside the top 26 in his last six starts including a tie for second at the Rocket Mortgage.

Just four weeks remain for players to earn points toward the FedEx Cup standings. After the Wyndham Championship in early August, the top 70 players in the standings will qualify for the FedEx Cup Playoffs. The 2024 Scottish Open has attracted eight of the top 10 players in the standings.\n\nRory McIlroy, who's ranked No. 3 in the standings, is the +650 favorite in the 2024 Scottish Open odds, just ahead of reigning PGA champion Xander Schauffele (+750). Collin Morikawa (+1200), Ludvig Aberg (+1400), Viktor Hovland (+2000) and Tommy Fleetwood (+2000) round out the top six choices in the 2024 Scottish Open field. Before locking in any 2024 Scottish Open picks, make sure you see the PGA Tour predictions and best bets from golf betting and fantasy expert Sia Nejad.\n\nNejad specializes in betting and DFS in golf, among other sports. He's had incredible success in the outright and first-round leader markets and in betting head-to-head matchups. He also has been solid with his head-to-head matchups since last year's Charles Schwab Challenge, going 51-35-5 and returning 12.93 units over that span. That's a $1,293 profit for $100 bettors since May 2023.\n\nNejad also nailed Wyndham Clark, a 75-1 longshot, as the outright winner at the Wells Fargo Championship last year. In 2023, SportsLine debuted \"The Early Wedge,\" and in the first three months of the show, he hit two first-round leaders and three outright winners. Last week, Nejad included Davis Thompson among his outright winners and scored at +2200 when Thompson won going away.\n\nNow, Nejad has turned his attention to the 2024 Scottish Open field and locked in his best bets, top sleepers and favorites to avoid. See who they are at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 Scottish Open expert picks\n\nOne surprise: Nejad is completely fading Tommy Fleetwood, even though he is ranked No. 11 in the world. The winner of more than $23.9 million in his career, Fleetwood is coming off a 15th-place finish at the Travelers Championship three weeks ago. He has not finished inside the top 10 since tying for third in the Masters in April.\n\nIn addition, Fleetwood is still looking for his first career PGA Tour victory. Fleetwood, who played his first PGA Tour event in 2013, is winless in 140 starts on the PGA Tour. \"He's a popular pick for many, but I simply don't think he can close in a field like this so I'll be avoiding him,\" Nejad told SportsLine.\n\nAnother curveball: Nejad is high on Swedish sensation Ludvig Aberg, who is +1400 in the 2024 Scottish Open odds. The 24-year-old Aberg has made a meteoric rise in the golf world. He turned pro a little more than a year ago and since then has earned his first PGA Tour win (2023 RSM Classic) and climbed to No. 4 in the world. He already has made more than $10.9 million.\n\nAberg enters the Scottish Open on a roll. Over his last eight starts, he has finished in the top 15 six times. \"I love his upside if the short game shines, and I like that he's taken the last two weeks off to prepare to go overseas and rest his knee, which has been a small issue this year,\" Nejad said. See which other players to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make 2024 Scottish Open picks\n\nNejad has locked in his best bets for the 2024 Scottish Open and is backing multiple longshots, including one priced at more than +5000. This player \"fits the mold of a player who can win this tournament\" and is a longshot who could surprise. You can see Nejad's PGA Tour picks only at SportsLine.\n\nSo which players should you target or avoid for the 2024 Scottish Open, and which player in the Scottish Open 2024 field could bring a huge payday of more than +5000? Check out the odds below, then visit SportsLine to see Sia Nejad's top picks for the 2024 Scottish Open, all from the expert who is 51-35-5 on his last 91 golf head-to-head picks and hit Davis Thompson last week at +2200.\n\n2024 Scottish Open odds, field\n\nSee Nejad's picks, best bets and predictions here.\n\nRory McIlroy +650\n\nXander Schauffele +750\n\nCollin Morikawa +1200\n\nLudvig Aberg +1400\n\nViktor Hovland +2000\n\nTommy Fleetwood +2000\n\nTom Kim +2500\n\nMin Woo Lee +2500\n\nHideki Matsuyama +2800\n\nMatt Fitzpatrick +3500\n\nJustin Thomas +3500\n\nSungjae Im +4000\n\nRobert MacIntyre +4000\n\nCorey Conners +4000\n\nAaron Rai +4000\n\nWyndham Clark +4500\n\nSahith Theegala +4500\n\nMax Homa +5000\n\nJordan Spieth +5000\n\nChristiaan Bezuidenhout +5000\n\nByeong Hun An +5000\n\nBrian Harman +5000\n\nSepp Straka +5500\n\nDavis Thompson +5500\n\nSi Woo Kim +6000\n\nThomas Detry +7000\n\nAdam Scott +7000\n\nTom Hoge +7500\n\nErik Van Rooyen +7500\n\nAlex Noren +7500\n\nWill Zalatoris +8000\n\nTom McKibbin +8000\n\nRyan Fox +8000\n\nNicolai Hojgaard +8000\n\nKeith Mitchell +8000\n\nDenny McCarthy +8000\n\nBilly Horschel +8000\n\nRasmus Hojgaard +9000\n\nMatthieu Pavon +9000\n\nHarris English +10000\n\nVictor Perez +11000\n\nSebastian Soderberg +11000\n\nRickie Fowler +11000\n\nMatt Wallace +11000\n\nKurt Kitayama +11000\n\nKeita Nakajima +11000\n\nJordan Smith +11000\n\nEwen Ferguson +11000\n\nAdam Hadwin +11000\n\nTaylor Moore +12000\n\nSeamus Power +12000\n\nRyo Hisatsune +12000\n\nMackenzie Hughes +12000\n\nKevin Yu +12000\n\nJustin Rose +12000\n\nBernd Wiesberger +12000\n\nBen Griffin +12000\n\nSam Stevens +15000\n\nMatthew Jordan +15000\n\nMark Hubbard +15000\n\nLaurie Canter +15000\n\nGuido Migliozzi +15000\n\nEric Cole +15000\n\nCam Davis +15000\n\nAustin Eckroat +15000\n\nLucas Glover +17000\n\nDoug Ghim +17000\n\nAndrew Novak +17000\n\nTaylor Montgomery +17000\n\nThorbjorn Olesen +20000\n\nSami Valimaki +20000\n\nRikuya Hoshino +20000\n\nRichard Mansell +20000\n\nNick Taylor +20000\n\nMatti Schmid +20000\n\nLee Hodges +20000\n\nEmiliano Grillo +20000\n\nDavis Riley +20000\n\nCalum Hill +20000\n\nAndrew Putnam +20000\n\nThriston Lawrence +25000\n\nRomain Langasque +25000\n\nNiklas Norgaard +25000\n\nMatthew Southgate +25000\n\nK.H.

Rory McIlroy, with a 12.6% chance and odds of +750, is another significant value pick, as he looks to win his second straight Scottish Open.\n\nFor those looking to place a bet on Rory McIlroy or any other golfer, the Bet365 promo code DIMERS is a top choice.

This week, there is a plethora of value on the board, and the model has spotlighted three players with odds ranging from +750 to +1400, making them strong contenders for those aiming to pick an outright winner at the 2024 Scottish Open.\n\nXander Schauffele continues to solidify his position as one of the elite golfers in the world. With a win probability of 15.3% compared to an implied probability of 10.53%, he presents a notable edge of 4.77%, indicating strong value at the +850 odds.\n\nRecently, Schauffele has been in remarkable form. He secured a top finish at the PGA Championship and has consistently been in contention in most tournaments he has entered this year. Notably, Schauffele has not finished outside the top 25 in his last ten starts, underlining his consistent high-level performance.\n\nWhen it comes to the Scottish Open, Schauffele has shown his adaptability to links golf. He has competed in the event multiple times, having won it in 2022.\n\nGiven his current form, historical success at the tournam,ent, and the significant positive edge in his win probability, Xander Schauffele stands out as the best bet to make at this year's Scottish Open.\n\nRory McIlroy is always a formidable presence on the golf course, and his stats back that up. With a win probability of 12.6% versus an implied probability of 11.76%, McIlroy offers an edge of 0.84%, making him a valuable bet at +750 odds.\n\nMcIlroy has been in excellent form recently, with a runner-up finish at the US Open highlighting his current season. He has consistently placed well in major tournaments and other high-profile events, demonstrating his ability to compete at the highest level. This year, McIlroy has multiple top-10 finishes, further proving his elite status.\n\nAt the Scottish Open, McIlroy's track record is impressive. As the defending champion, he brings valuable experience and confidence to the Renaissance Club. His previous performances at the event have been stellar, with multiple top finishes that showcase his comfort and skill on links courses.\n\nWith his proven track record, recent strong performances, and the slight positive edge in his win probability, Rory McIlroy is a prime candidate for outright win bets at this year's Scottish Open.\n\nCollin Morikawa continues to impress with his precise and composed play. He has a win probability of 8.0%, compared to an implied probability of 6.67%, resulting in an edge of 1.33%, making him a valuable pick at +1400 odds.\n\nMorikawa's recent form has been commendable. He has posted several strong finishes this season, including top-10 placements at the Masters and the PGA Championship. His accuracy and calm demeanor under pressure make him a consistent contender in high-stakes tournaments.\n\nDespite having missed the cut in his most recent time here, Morikawa's precision iron play and strategic approach are well-suited to the demands of the Scottish Open.\n\nConsidering his current form, historical success in similar conditions, and the positive edge in his win probability, Collin Morikawa presents a strong case as a recommended bet for both outright win and placement bets at this year's Scottish Open.\n\nBeyond the top favorites with odds like Rory's +750, there are some intriguing sleeper picks further down the board. By digging deeper into the field, we find players with odds as high as +10000 (that's right, 100-to-1!), providing substantial potential for astute bettors. Here are a few sleeper picks to keep an eye on:\n\nHideki Matsuyama offers significant value this week with a win probability of 3.9% against an implied probability of 2.78%, resulting in an edge of 1.12%. Priced at +3500, Matsuyama presents a compelling option for bettors.\n\nRecently, Matsuyama has displayed solid form, securing top-20 finishes in several recent tournaments, including a sixth place finish at the US Open. His consistent play highlights his potential to contend at the Scottish Open.\n\nMatsuyama's experience with links-style golf, combined with his excellent ball-striking, makes him a notable contender. Although he hasn't competed extensively at the Scottish Open, his adaptability and recent performances suggest he could excel at the Renaissance Club.\n\nCorey Conners is a solid value pick with a win probability of 2.6% compared to an implied probability of 1.79%, offering an edge of 0.81%. With odds of +5500, Conners is an attractive option for those looking for a high-reward bet.\n\nConners has been in impressive form, consistently finishing in the top 25 in recent tournaments, including a T9 at the US Open and T6 at his local Canadian Open. His reliable play and strong iron game make him a consistent threat in any field.\n\nAt the Scottish Open, Conners' steady performance style is well-suited to the course. While he may not have extensive experience here, his overall game and recent form position him well to potentially surprise the field.\n\nDenny McCarthy stands out with a win probability of 2.0% and an implied probability of 1.00%, giving him a notable edge of 1.00%. At +10000 odds, McCarthy presents a high-value betting opportunity.\n\nMcCarthy has shown flashes of brilliance this season, with several top-10 finishes, including a T7 at last week's John Deere Classic. His putting prowess and ability to perform under pressure make him a dark horse candidate in any tournament.\n\nWhile this will be the first time that McCarthy has competed at the Scottish Open, his recent form and strengths in key areas suggest he could capitalize on the opportunities presented by the Renaissance Club. Betting on McCarthy offers significant upside for those willing to take a chance on a high-potential sleeper.\n\nAs the Scottish Open 2024 nears, excitement is mounting for what promises to be a spectacular display of golfing prowess at the Renaissance Club. Leveraging insights from Dimers and their comprehensive Dimers Pro tool, we've spotlighted the golfers with the highest chances of triumph, as well as value picks and sleeper options that offer enticing betting opportunities. Xander Schauffele is the current favorite according to Dimers, followed by Rory McIlory and Collin Morikawa, with numerous value options further down the board, such as the favorable odds on Hideki Matsuyama and Corey Conners.\n\nFor those eager to engage with the tournament through sports betting, the array of promotions and bonus bets available this week presents an excellent chance to enhance your experience. Whether you're a veteran bettor or new to the game, the exclusive offers for new users and the expert analysis provided by Dimers can help guide your strategy, ensuring you make well-informed decisions.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davis Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denny McCarthy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/FAZV7T57TBBPLN2232FPIHC2AU.jpg?auth=08ed5ea0a75079d744a36266f51a5b4a436c9291f7b785c34569216babf5d431&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 139}], "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

It's co-sanctioned by the PGA and DP World Tour. Due to rescheduling by the PGA and the British Open next week, six of the top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings are in the Scottish Open field.\n\nThis includes the past two Scottish Open champions, Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele, the 2023 U.S. Open winner Wyndham Clark, rookie phenom Ludvig \u00c5berg, the 2021 Champion Golfer of the Year, Collin Morikawa, and 2023 PGA TOUR champion Viktor Hovland.\n\nThe Renaissance Club is an American-Scottish hybrid course. The Sarvadi family from North Carolina purchased a 99-year lease from the Duke of Hamilton for the land to build The Renaissance Club on. It was designed by American golf course architect Tom Doak. His biggest influence was Alister Mackenzie, the original designer of the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nIt is a Par-70 that plays 7,237 yards: Three Par-5s, five Par-3s, and 10 Par-4s. If the weather is calm, the Scottish Open can be a birdie fest. However, The Renaissance Club is a bear if the wind picks up.\" Length off-the-tee (OTT), strong long iron play, and reliable putting are the recipe for success at the Scottish Open.\n\nAs an example of how brutal golf betting can be, three of my picks for last week's John Deere Classic finished inside the top 10, and I was still -3.0 units (u). I have four second-place finishes this year, including Michael Thorbjornsen last week. These close calls keep me from throwing in the towel even though my PGA TOUR 2024 balance is -51.27u.\n\nThe odds chosen are the best available at legal U.S. sportsbooks.\n\nLee won the Scottish Open in 2021 at +10000 odds before it was a co-sanctioned event on the PGA TOUR. However, the Scottish Open was STACKED with talent featuring Jon Rahm, who was World No. 1 then, Rory McIlroy, a young Scottie Scheffler, Xander, and Morikawa.\n\nFurthermore, Min Woo and Rory winning last year's Scottish Open suggests \"bombers\" play well at The Renaissance Club. Lee is sixth in Strokes Gained (SG): Off-the-Tee (OTT) on TOUR this season and fourth in Club Head Speed. He's gained strokes OTT in all 13 starts on TOUR this year.\n\nAlso, The Renaissance Club has large greens with an above-average 3-putt rate. The Aussie is 10th in 3-Putt Avoidance on TOUR in 2024 and ninth in Approach Putting. Min Woo has gained strokes with his putter in three of his four Scottish Opens, according to DataGolf.com.\n\nLee's iron-play can be sketchy. However, he's better with his long irons than most golfers because of that fast Club Head Speed. Min Woo is 15th in proximity to the hole from 175-200 yards and 37th from 200+ yards on TOUR this season.\n\nFinally, Lee comes into the Scottish Open with good form. He's finished T26 or better in six straight starts, including the first three majors this season. Min Woo tied for second in the Rocket Mortgage Classic and would've been in the playoff if he didn't bogey the 72nd hole in the final round.\n\n_____________________________\n\nKeep in mind, due to nagging back and neck injuries, Matsuyama has played mostly in \"signature events\" this year. Hideki has made the cut in all 14 starts this year with four T8 or better finishes and a win at The Genesis Invitational.\n\nThe 2021 Masters champion is back to playing top-level golf because his driver is a weapon again this season. He has gained strokes OTT in 12 of his 14 starts this season, per DataGolf.com. This is despite Matsuyama being average on TOUR in both driving distance and accuracy.\n\nGranted, Hideki will have to use his long irons for most second shots at The Renaissance Club since he is not long OTT. But, Hideki is sixth in approach shots from 175-200 yards out on TOUR this season and 29th from 200+ yards.\n\nMoreover, he's also one of the best around-the-green (ARG) in the world, which is valuable no matter the course. If The Renaissance Club plays tough and it's difficult to hit the green in regulation, Matsuyama can score from ARG.\n\nFinally, Matsuyama sucks at putting. Yet, according to DataGolf.com, he's gained strokes on the greens in five consecutive starts and eight of the last 10, including three majors, and four \"signature events\".\n\n_____________________________\n\nUntil this season, the driver has been the weakest club in Spieth's bag. Over the last 40 rounds with shot-link data, Spieth is ninth among PGA TOUR players in this field for SG: OTT and 20th in Ball Speed, per Bet The Number. Again, elite drivers do well at The Renaissance Club and Spieth has gained strokes OTT in his first two Scottish Opens in 2022-23.\n\nThe 10-time PGA TOUR champion is having a down year with the putter. Regardless, Spieth is typically great with the flat-stick, so I'm expecting he will turn it around on the greens by season's end. Plus, Jordan is still 35th in 3-Putt Avoidance and ninth in Approach Putting on TOUR this year.\n\nSpieth has a proven track record on links-style courses. He is the 2017 Champion Golfer of the Year. Jordan has four additional T9 or better finishes at The Open: T8 in 2022, second in 2021, T9 in 2018, and T4 in 2015. Even Spieth's 2015 U.S. Open victory was at more of a \"links-style\" course. He did miss the cut at the 2023 Scottish Open but finished T10 two years ago.\n\nSpieth's Scottish Open will come down to how well he's hitting his irons. Unfortunately, this season, he ranks 110th in SG: Approach (APP) on TOUR. Nonetheless, according to DataGolf.com, Jordan has gained strokes with his irons in four of his last six starts, including the U.S. Open and PGA Championship.\n\n_____________________________\n\nThis is an absolute \"dart\" because I've never seen this kid play and he is a full-time DP World Tour pro. Either way, I must include a DP golfer on my 2024 Scottish Open betting card. McKibbin won the 2023 Porsche European Open and has six top-10 finishes this year, with a sixth at the KLM Open and a second at the Italian Open in his last two starts.\n\nThe 21-year-old from Northern Ireland grew up playing at the same home club as Rory, the Holywood Golf Club. McKibbin is second in SG: OTT this season among full-time DP World Tour players. He's gained strokes with his irons in four straight starts. Plus, McKibbin was T35 at the 2023 Scottish Open, picking up strokes on the greens and on approach.\n\n_____________________________\n\nIt's been a rough rookie season on TOUR for H\u00f8jgaard. After finishing second at the Farmers Insurance Open in his first start of the year, H\u00f8jgaard missed 15 cuts and his best finish was a T16 at The Masters. He finished with a +2 at Augusta, but H\u00f8jgaard got as low as -7 through 46 holes, which was the final score of Ludvig \u00c5berg who finished second.\n\nNevertheless, his impressive finish at The Masters is part of the reason why I like H\u00f8jgaard and I am using him again, even though he's cost me money this year. He has a \"major-winning ceiling\". H\u00f8jgaard got to the PGA TOUR, and the European 2023 Ryder Cup team, by winning the 2023 DP World Tour Championship.\n\nThat isn't some bullsh*t European golf event. Several of the best golfers in the world played in last year's DP World Tour Championship, such as Viktor Hovland, Tommy Fleetwood, Rahm, Tom Kim, Rory, etc. So, H\u00f8jgaard won a \"big boy\" tournament and a Ryder Cup, and he is only 23 years old.\n\nNot only does he have true \"win equity\", but H\u00f8jgaard bombs it OTT and hits his long irons well, a recipe for success at The Renaissance Club. Nicolai is 16th in driving distance on TOUR this season, first in proximity to the hole from 175-200 yards, and 30th from 200+ yards out.\n\nPer DataGolf.com, H\u00f8jgaard has gained strokes with his irons in three straight starts and four of the last five, including the PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Ultimately, H\u00f8jgaard is going for 90-to-1 odds when he should be closer to 60-to-1 odds.\n\n_____________________________\n\nMake placement bets at BetMGM, DraftKings, or FanDuel. BetMGM never applies \"dead heat\" rules. DraftKings and FanDuel have top-5, -10, and -20 bets that \"include ties\" for the 2024 Genesis Scottish Open.\n\nThe 2024 PGA champion has finished in the top 10 in 11 of 18 starts this season. Xander is the top golfer in my power rankings and won the 2022 Scottish Open. There isn't a hole in Schauffele's game currently. He is ninth in SG: OTT, fifth in SG: APP, 28th in SG: Around-the-Green, and 11th in SG: Putting on TOUR this year. He has the lowest rate of 3-Putts as well.\n\nI'm sticking with my pre-season plan of betting on Kim at the Scottish Open this week and most likely The Open Championship next week. Kim was T6 and third in the past two Scottish Opens and T2 at The Open last year. He's gained strokes on APP and with his putter in all four of his career Scottish and British Opens.\n\nTom is starting to play better after struggling to start the season. The South Korean lost to Scheffler in a playoff at the Travelers Championship (\"signature event\") a couple of weeks ago. He tied for fourth at the RBC Canadian Open last month too. The 22-year-old has gained strokes with his driver in seven consecutive starts.\n\n_____________________________\n\nAfter 25 tournaments, I have $11,578,835 and rank 1,477th in the 2024 Mayo Cup One-And-Done league. I've used my first three Genesis Scottish Open picks and my two finishing position bets in earlier events. Besides \u00c5berg, who I'm saving for The Open Championship or one of the FedExCup playoff events, Fleetwood is the highest-ranked player I have available.\n\nFleetwood is a seven-time DP World Tour winner in good form. The Englishman has seven top-20 finishes on TOUR in 2024, including a T3 at The Masters and T16 at the U.S. Open. He was T6 at last year's Scottish Open, T4 in 2022, and second in 2020. Ultimately, this is a use-it-or-lose-it scenario since I'm not picking Fleetwood in the remaining \"big boy\" events.\n\n_____________________________\n\nFollow me on X (or Twitter, whatever) @Geoffery-Clark and check out my OutKick Bets Podcast for more betting content and random rants.

A seasoned golf bettor and commentator, Kannon is a regular guest on SportsGrid, a syndicated audio network devoted to sports and sport betting. You can follow on Twitter at @LasVegasGolfer, and you can read his picks below for the Genesis Scottish Open, which gets underway Thursday in North Berwick, Scotland. Along with Kannon's recommended plays, you'll also see data from Chirp Golf, a mobile app that features both Free-To-Play and Daily Fantasy golf contests where you can win cash and prizes with each round and tournament.\n\nWho wouldn't want to play golf in Scotland for the next couple of weeks?\n\nAfter a trifecta of birdie-fests stateside, the PGA Tour spends the next two weeks across the pond, beginning with the Genesis Scottish Open in North Berwick, followed by the final major championship of the season, the Open Championship at Royal Troon.\n\nIt will be the sixth consecutive season that the Scottish Open takes place at The Renaissance Club, a par-70 Tom Doak design that measures a little better than 7,200 yards. It will be the third straight year in which the tournament is a co-sanctioned between the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour. Each tour will send roughly its best 75 players into battle. A few names that are noticeably absent this week are World No. 1, Scottie Scheffler, Tony Finau and Patrick Cantlay.\n\nThe golf course provides a perfect tune-up for The Open because of its more modern links-style design that opened in 2008. It is a softer, gentler seaside links test compared to the full-fledged version to follow next week. As is often true, when we shift over to the United Kingdom, the putting surfaces become much slower this week at The Renaissance Club. They are a fescue grass surface and ought to run at about a 10 on the Stimpmeter, compared to a standard Tour event running at about a 12.\n\nPutting has proven to be a key statistic over the last five editions of this tournament. Driving Distance and Strokes Gained: Off the Tee have manifested in the form of big hitters Min Woo Lee, Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy being your last three winners.\n\nThe setup is unique, as there are five par-3s, three par-5s and 10 par-4s. Only one par-4 is less than 400 yards and six of them measure between 450-500 yards. With some rain in the forecast and the wind expected to be relatively light, one will need to rack up some birdies and, as is always the case around a links design, creativity and scrambling will be necessary for success.\n\nBecause this golf course is relatively new, there are some comparable layouts that we are used to seeing. We also have a couple of Doak designs or redesigns we can throw into the mix, Memorial Park in Houston, home to the Houston Open the last four seasons, and St. George's Golf & Country Club, home to the Canadian Open, most recently in 2022. Others that I considered relatable are PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens. We have seen a great deal of crossover success between Open champions, links players and those who have fared well at what is now the Cognizant Classic (previously the Honda). Silverado in Napa (Fortinet), Detroit Golf Club (Rocket Mortgage), TPC Craig Ranch (Byron Nelson), Hamilton Golf & Country Club (Canadian Open 2019, 2024) and Pinehurst No. 2, home to the U.S. Open just last month, are the others that made my list this week.\n\nSo, what does all of that mean? Interestingly enough, I do not have a single American player on my card this week. By no means intentionally -- I believe it just speaks to the element of randomness here, not only with links golf in general, but the fact that this is a week before a major championship, and also due to the fact that half the players in the field are from, for the most part, an entirely different world golf tour. I have played each for an outright win and a top-20 finish.\n\nFull disclosure, I already have a ticket on Fleetwood for next week at Royal Troon at 30-1, so I was hesitant to double-up and add him here but I couldn't keep him off the card in the end, given his excellent season-long form and his play at this golf course, where he has finished sixth, fourth and runner-up, losing in a playoff in 2020. Very accurate off the tee, great links player. Over the last 36 rounds, Fleetwood is eighth in this field for scrambling and 13th on the par-4s measuring 450-500 yards. He also owns a third- and fourth-place finish at the Honda Classic. In typical Fleetwood fashion, he may not win but I have to believe he will at least be close.\n\nA winner over Matt Fitzpatrick and Thomas Detry in a playoff here in 2021, I am banking on another strong showing from the Australian. He's finished top-35 here on two other occasions. He comes off a runner-up finish at the Rocket Mortgage Classic and was runner-up earlier this season at PGA National. He hasn't finished worse than 26th in his last six starts, including a 21st at Pinehurst and a 24th at TPC Craig Ranch. Over the last 36 rounds, he's top-10 in this field for Driving Distance and SG: Off the Tee, and top-20 in this field for Birdies or Better Gained and on the par-4s of 450-500 yards.\n\nMaybe the stars are aligning for Rai, going back to his native Europe, to a course at which he's won before -- in a playoff over Fleetwood in 2020 -- coming off two consecutive weeks of being in the final group on Sunday. Maybe this is what it will take to get the Englishman over the hump. He finished seventh for the second time at Memorial Park in Houston earlier this season. He took 14th at Pinehurst, 14th at Hamilton in Canada and was 13th at St. George's in Canada in 2022. For all that appears to be in his favor, 50-1 is a heck of a price.\n\nSpeaking of price, I believe that is what we are getting here on a guy whose form suddenly dipped mid-season. Clark was either winning at Pebble Beach or seemingly finishing second to Scottie Scheffler every week before falling off around early April. He does come off a top-10 however, a few weeks ago at the Travelers Championship, and he has very solid history here at The Renaissance Club with finishes of 16th and 25th. He has an 11th and a seventh at PGA National, an eighth in Detroit, a 16th in Houston and a seventh in Canada in 2022. The timing could be right for one of the best players in the world being a bit out of the spotlight.\n\nNoren is a former Scottish Open winner. Not at this golf course but the man does have links golf chops, having won 11 times on the DP World Tour. He also has three top-10 finishes at PGA National, two in Detroit, one at TPC Craig Ranch and one at Memorial Park. He's excellent on approach and on the long par-4s and his short game is world class. It feels similar to Fleetwood, neither of which have won on U.S. soil, in that he may not win here but I can see him having another strong week.\n\nDetry seems to love this golf course, maybe more than anyone else in the field. This will be his sixth straight time playing The Renaissance Club with no finish worse than 43rd. He was top-10 in 2022 and lost a playoff to Lee in 2021. He too has been in excellent form with a runner-up in Houston, a fourth at the PGA Championship and a 14th at Pinehurst. Detry can rack up the birdies and is an excellent putter.\n\nCrazy, I've seen this number as high as 150-1 and as low as 80-1. Like Noren, Wallace is another long shot who is a very classy links player. It was just last fall that he finished sixth at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. He's been consistently in the top-30 here in North Berwick and finished as high as 14th here in 2019. He has finished top-12 twice at Detroit Golf Club and just took fourth at the Byron Nelson this season. Just a few weeks ago, he was 15th at the KLM Open in the Netherlands. Wallace hits it long enough, is very solid on approach and owns a far better than average short game. Another attractive European long shot.\n\nNow this one is even longer but again, I believe he has a better shot than his price would indicate, and I also believe he has a good shot to cash us a top-20 finish. Jordan burst on the scene last July when he finished top-10 at The Open Championship in his hometown. He hits is long, he hits greens in regulation and he can putt. He took 18th here in 2021 and has recorded three top-13 finishes in his last five starts. Where bounces, weather and results can be quite random, I believe the young Jordan is worth a punt.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Our golf betting picks consider him one of the best value plays to win the 2024 Genesis Scottish Open.\n\nEven with World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler opting out of the Genesis Scottish Open, it's a loaded field hitting The Renaissance Club this week.\n\nRory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele headline the favorites in the Scottish Open odds, and they're followed by a strong second tier consisting of Ludvig Aberg, Collin Morikawa, Tommy Fleetwood, and Viktor Hovland.\n\nMorikawa checks all the boxes. He's gained true strokes across the board in four consecutive events and has finished T16 or better in each of his past nine individual tournaments, including his T3 at The Masters, T4 at the PGA Championship, and T14 at the U.S. Open.\n\nThe six-time PGA Tour winner took down The Open Championship at Royal St. George's in 2021, which is a comparable track to The Renaissance Club, and Morikawa's seventh victory is coming. His game is incredibly tight, and he's consistently put himself in a position to win during the noted sterling stretch of strong finishes in stacked-field events.\n\nMorikawa is also trading at a friendly -110 to finish Top 20 through bet365, compared to -120 odds at most shops. It's a complimentary bet I like given Morikawa's form\n\nSleeper: Aaron Rai (+4,500 at DraftKings)\n\nRai's strong run continued at the John Deere Classic with a second consecutive Top 10 and his fourth straight Top 20. His ball striking paves the way, and he's also gained true strokes on the greens in each of his past three events.\n\nRai is accurate off the tee and ranks 15th in this field in true strokes gained tee-to-green and 16th in true strokes gained on approaches during the noted four-tournament stretch. Additionally, while the Englishman is still looking for his first PGA Tour win, Rai has multiple victories on the DP World Tour. Of course, his most recent DP win was right here at The Renaissance Club in the 2020 Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open.\n\nA secondary wager on Rai to finish Top 30 is priced at +125 through bet365 and is a far more favorable number than the -105 odds through DraftKings. The difference checks out as a positive expected value of 15%.\n\nThe Canuck continues to show off elite ball striking and has six consecutive Top 40 finishes. Conners has gained true strokes on approaches in all six events and ranks fifth in this field in true strokes gained tee-to-green during the surge. He also finished T19 in this event last season, and I particularly value that he gained true strokes on the greens in three of four rounds because his putting often isn't a strength.\n\nFinally, there's also a nice edge in the -105 bet365 odds compared to the -150 DraftKings price. We're landing a positive expected value of 17% with the -105 number.\n\nDavis Thompson Top 40 finish (+105 at BetRivers)\n\nI don't anticipate Thompson's heater will cool across the pond. His game is dialed in, and he's gained true strokes across the board in each of his past three events to rank first in this field in both tee-to-green and around-the-green metrics. Additionally, his accelerating career trajectory is right in line with his success on the Korn Ferry Tour and as the former No. 1 player in the Amateur World Golf Ranking in 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimply put, Thompson is a legitimate talent, and this is a mispriced number for a peaking player. After all, he's priced as short as -140 through DraftKings to finish Top 40, with the difference checking out at a positive expected value of 20% compared", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_Insurance_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Farmers Insurance Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_St_George's_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal St George's Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_Ferry_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korn Ferry Tour"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/a54dfdc7-0a88-48fa-880d-c4489330168e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Featuring large, sloping greens and long fescue, The Renaissance Club in Scotland plays host to this event for a sixth consecutive year. The par-70 venue's wide landing areas off the tee favor the bombers, but this layout requires stout iron play and cromulent lag putting. However, North Berwick's forecast calls for a tame breeze throughout the tournament, so we could see this turn into somewhat of a birdie fest with few defenses guarding the even-par mark.\n\nMaking his first appearance since being outplayed by Bryson DeChambeau down the stretch at the U.S. Open, McIlroy returns to the Genesis Scottish Open as the event's defending champion after pacing the field in driving distance en route to 22 total birdies and an eagle here last year. McIlroy has landed on the positive side of each Strokes Gained subcategory in five straight measured starts dating back to his win at the Wells Fargo Championship, and over his past 24 rounds, he's second to none in both SG: Off-the-Tee and P4: 450-500 Efficiency.\n\nXander Schauffele - $45\n\nPer usual, Yahoo's pricing makes it relatively easy to stack multiple studs up top, so it's entirely plausible to target both of the tournament favorites that each carry outright odds shorter than 10/1 this week. Schauffele won here at The Renaissance Club two years ago in tough conditions, and his putter has been red hot ever since THE PLAYERS Championship in mid-March.\n\nFifth in both Opportunities Gained and Birdies or Better Gained over his last 24 rounds, Conners has been stellar from tee to green since the Wells Fargo Championship, though he also enjoyed a couple spike weeks with his putter on the way to a pair of top-10s at the RBC Canadian Open and the U.S. Open. He posted a top-20 result at last year's Scottish Open when he fired two rounds of 66 or better and ranked second among the field in driving accuracy.\n\nAaron Rai - $34\n\nRai extended his top-20 streak to four consecutive outings this past week at the John Deere Classic, where he gained a career-high 8.9 strokes on the greens while averaging six birdies per round. The Englishman also happens to be a past champion here at The Renaissance Club (2020), and he's top-5 in both SG: Approach and P4: 450-500 Efficiency over his last 24 rounds.\n\nSitting No. 1 in each of SG: APP, Prox: 175-200 and P3: 200-225 Efficiency over his past 24 rounds, Yu models extremely well this week, and it doesn't hurt his cause that he's coming off four straight made cuts from the Charles Schwab Challenge to the John Deere Classic. He's a superb ball striker, especially at the $20 minimum, and Yu even gained a collective 3.7 strokes putting across his last two events played.\n\nAndrew Novak - $20\n\nA scorching-hot putter guided Novak to three consecutive top-20s from the RBC Canadian Open through the John Deere Classic, but he also gained strokes with his irons at each tournament during this recent stretch, improving to 12th in Prox: 175-200 and 29th in Prox: 200-plus over his last 24 rounds. Within this sample, he's also top-10 in both Birdies or Better Gained and three-putt avoidance. This past week at TPC Deere Run, Novak ranked second in putts per GIR and feet of putts made en route to 28 total birdies, allowing him to rack up a season-high 135.3 Yahoo fantasy points.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Deere Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Deere_Run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TPC Deere Run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Invitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonial National Invitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718858", "eventUri": "eng-9718858", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Berwick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

This Wednesday article will now serve as a final bow to wrap up a jam-packed week of PGA content at Flag Hunting. No fluff, no rants or superfluous soliloquies, just the entirety of our 2024 Scottish Open outright betting card.\n\nThe four names on this betting card are aimed at returning about 6.5 times our investment. Because of the inflated odds associated with the outright market, it becomes even more imperative to remain disciplined when setting your unit allocations from this article's picks. Golf outright betting is a notoriously fickle beast, and multiple month-long droughts are very much within the range of outcomes. However, at these prices, one single hit can pay off many weeks of poor decision-making.\n\nIn the over two-year history at Flag Hunting, we've been fortunate enough to cash a total of 24 outright winners (a 20.0% hit rate) for a profit of over $14,000 (betting roughly $350 per week) and an aggregate ROI of 33.8%. The volatility of the sport means I can't promise you a winner in any given tournament. But if you're willing to bet methodically and stick with the process, outright golf betting has the potential to be one of the most profitable (and enjoyable) betting sweats in the business. But I suppose I'd better keep my word about the necessary rants, so with no further ado, here's every bet I've made for the 2024 Genesis Scottish Open!\n\nI know he hasn't quite cashed in for his outright backers at these lofty price points in 2024, but with each passing week, I cannot help but grow more and more fond of Ludvig's weekly prospects. He's found himself in legitimate contention in both his Masters and U.S. Open debuts: Both driver heavy courses that play exceedingly firm and fast, came fifth at his debut at Muirfield Village, and if not for the worst putting performance of his young career at the Travelers, would have assuredly logged yet another top finish in an elevated event (5th in SG: Tee-to-Green; -7.2 strokes putting).\n\nI'm not at all worried about this minor blip on the greens one week after an exhausting four days at Pinehurst. And now, he heads to a venue that has not only been very friendly to elite drivers through the years (Rory, Xander, Min Woo, Kitayama, Detry, Fitz, etc.), but also one that should suit his current long-iron form like a glove (2nd in this field in Weighted Proximity over the last five months, 3rd in GIR Percentage, 8th in SG: Approach).\n\nLudvig's stock also rises on a golf course that features the easiest around the green complexes on the PGA Tour: a facet of the game that cost him dearly around the treacherous chipping confines of Augusta National and Pinehurst No. 2, and Aberg has also happened to find two of his best putting weeks on coastal tracks where greens need to be slowed down for threat of winds (Pebble Beach; Sea Island). I've been hesitant to buy into the 2023 Texas Tech Grad in some of his more high profile debuts, but he's consistently exceeded my expectations on the game's biggest (and most demanding) stages. At this point, I'm comfortable enough deploying his services regardless of the venue -- and if he continues to be priced anywhere near the 20-1 range going forward, you can bet he'll at least find a way on my weekly shortlist.\n\nIf Ludvig's write-up was all about a projection on sheer ability, Tommy Fleetwood's place in this piece is all about his fit in this unique environment. The Englishman has been the most consistent links player on the planet over the last five years: recording ten top-twelve finishes in 14 starts at the Open Championship, Scottish Open, and Alfred Dunhill Links Championship since 2018.\n\nFleetwood's proficiency not only in the wind but also on and around the traditionally slower green complexes on the links makes him an ever-present threat in the British Isles. And this season, Fleetwood comes into his homecoming with some added momentum: ranking fifth in SG: Total over the last three months, and inside the top 30 in each of the four Strokes Gained categories.\n\nThis elite all-around skillset has allowed Tommy to record just one finish worse than 26th through a nine-start stretch since the start of April, and in the month of June, Tommy finally put his traditionally elite ball-striking back on display. In four starts from Canada to Muirfield Village, Pinehurst, and the Travelers, Fleetwood gained an average of 4.27 strokes with his driving and approach play: a mark that sits behind only Tom Kim, Collin Morikawa, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Aberg, and Rory McIlroy in that time.\n\nI know 25-1 outright bets on Fleetwood have't exactly returned positive value over the course of his career, but with his history around links tracks and his incoming form, I do believe he represents the safest entity in this field outside of the last two defending champions. He famously won his first-ever pro tournament as a fresh-faced 22-year-old at Gleneagles, and, I think he's got a great chance of repeating the trick for his first PGA Tour title just a couple hours down the Scottish coastline.\n\nLike what you read today?

Despite spending many of his developmental years traveling around Asia, the 22-year-old Korean has looked right at home in his introduction to golf in the British Isles: logging finishes of third and sixth through two starts here at Renaissance and recording his best ever Major finish (T2), in last year's Open Championship at Royal Liverpool.\n\nKim also comes into the week as one of the hottest golfers on the planet: gaining nearly five strokes per start with his ball-striking in the month of June and coming just one poor wedge shot short of besting World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler at the Travelers Championship three weeks ago. The 22-year-old phenom displayed tremendous poise throughout the week: logging weekend rounds of 65-66 despite entering the third round with the task of fending off three of the game's top five players.\n\nTom has plenty left to prove on the sport's longest tracks, but those weekend rounds in Cromwell proved to me that he's more than capable of taking down top titles on venues that suit his style of play. There are no questions about his fit here in Scotland, and with the confidence he's currently playing with, Tom Kim is incredibly live not only this week but perhaps to capture his first-ever Major title on Scotland's western coast.\n\nFleetwood and Kim might have more extensive track records in the British Isles in the last two seasons, but priced 10-plus points behind them on the odds board is a Major Champion who also happened to win in the last top-level links event contested on Scottish soil. Last October, Matthew Fitzpatrick fired rounds of 67-64-66 around Carnoustie, Kingsbarn, and St. Andrews to capture a weather-shortened Alfred Dunhill Links Championship -- defeating the likes of Tommy Fleetwood, Ryan Fox, Billy Horschel, and a selection of the DP World Tour's biggest names in his eighth career triumph in Europe.\n\nThis season, Fitzpatrick has had trouble establishing weekly consistency, but there have been intermittent signs of the player that reached a career high of sixth in the Official World Golf Rankings. Matt ranks ninth on the PGA Tour this season in Total Driving, he's a top 15 entity in this field in Proximity from >150 yards (a range for which ~2/3s of approach shots are expected to come this week), and he's logged finishes of second, sixth, and fourteenth over his last four starts at the Scottish Open.\n\nWith top five finishes already to his name at TPC Sawgrass and Muirfield Village this season, Fitzpatrick's already proven more than capable of contending on the Tour's biggest stages. At 40-1 this week, I'll gladly take a shot at a well-documented comfort course. After all, we're not so far removed from Fitzy being touted as one of the clearest breakout candidates in world golf.", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

What a wonderful Sunday sweat watching our horse dust the field with an opening 29 on the front. A smooth 126 over the weekend and we are collecting.\n\nThompson's performance reminds me of the weekend 122 (61-61), I witnessed at the RSM Classic by Ludvig \u00c5berg back in November. The Spieth/Thomas generation better watch out -- these kids are for real. How about the amateur Luke Clanton finishing in a tie for second with Micheal Thorbjornsen?!?!? I absolutely love the competition. Let's hope the PGA TOUR sees the storylines developing and builds us a better schedule for 2025. Who wouldn't want to watch two or three of these kids go after Scottie and Xander? I know I would.\n\nFor those who have been with us since the beginning, that's now 31 outright wins in 31 months since we started in January of 2022. Let's continue this two-and-a-half-year run across the pond at the Genesis Scottish Open. A partnership event between the DP World Tour and the PGA TOUR, we have 156 players in North Berwick, Scotland ready to compete for $9 million and a $1.62 million first-place check. The top 65 and ties make the weekend in this preview for next week's final major of the season; the 152nd Open Championship.\n\nThis preview is just that: a preview. For a complete list of my betting predictions covering the Scottish Open winners, finishing positions, and H2H matchups, please go to Read The Line and subscribe.\n\nBack in November, Ludvig \u00c5berg won a driver + putterfest on Sea Island alongside the Atlantic Ocean. Not quite a regular Scottish links, the Renaissance Club is closer to this world class retreat than St. Andrews. With no wind this week off the Firth of Forth, the field will bomb away and only one guy (Rory) can do that better than Ludvig.\n\nThrow in \u00c5berg's very opportunistic putter and you have the recipe for Renaissance success. \u00c5berg is also ranked fourth on approach. Ludvig already has one DP World Tour win and plenty of European experience coming from Sweden. While the other superstars look ahead to Troon, watch \"The Kid\" capture another crown.\n\nLet's take our momentum from Davis Thompson's win bet (and top 20) and go back-to-back with Kim in Scotland. Another tour player trending big time, Kim finished third here in 2022 and sixth last year. The key to Kim's success on links golf: his accuracy. He finished runner-up at Royal Liverpool to Brian Harman in last year's Open Championship. Take the 20 places and collect on Kim come Sunday.\n\nTheegala has not made a cut across the Atlantic since the 2022 Open Championship. Granted, his ball striking has vastly improved in 2024, but his short game and putting has fallen off in the meantime. He'll need those skills to succeed in Scotland.\n\nConversely, Fox plays better outside the US. He has only missed one cut in the last five years at The Open and Scottish Open. A quick T17 last week at the BMW in Germany, and he's ready for a run at the Genesis with his firepower off the tee and putter.\n\nOdds (shorter than +10000) courtesy of BetMGM.\n\nXander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy are essentially archetype players for contending at the Renaissance Club. This manufactured modern links design favors length over accuracy in more ways than one. You'll hear an endless amount of coverage about the weather, but in any future forecast the best chance you have to win is to back great drivers and putters.\n\nDoak also designed Memorial Park in Houston. Go check that TOUR stop leaderboard from back in March. It was littered with ball speed and birdie makers. The Renaissance Club presents little fear from the tee boxes. Players will be bombing away everywhere they can.\n\nThis course ranked in the bottom ten on TOUR for penalties off the tee in 2023. Even the 42 fairway bunkers won't cause concern. Consider the lack of wind predicted, and many of those off-the-tee hazards just won't be in play. The final two last year were Robert MacIntyre and Rory, two guys who are great drivers and putters.\n\nEveryone remembers the famous approach finale by MacIntyre and McIlroy into a gale-force wind. That Sunday was incredibly brutal. Thursday through Saturday the field played in rather benign conditions. Sunday whipped up a storm and blew most of the field away. That's what can happen around here. So as much as we want to load the card with just one type of player, we may need one or two other skill based competitors in case the weather goes sideways.\n\nMy favorite skill in golf is approach play. Bombing a drive is great, but there's nothing better for me than a tap-in birdie. Laser-like irons from long range are the best, and this Doak design gives you a bunch. Three par 5s to reach in two, three more par 3s over 200 yards, and four par 4s around 480 yards. Those 10 approaches separate the field. Both Xander and Rory can really attack from 200+ yards. Our outrights will be skilled in similar shots. Seventeen greens are surrounded by 38 bunkers. Doak's design also features a number of run-off areas and some long grass around the perimeter of the putting surfaces.\n\nPlayers have not needed a ton of around the green acumen to contend here. Most of the ground game involves planning the approach properly or the putter. Thankfully, we can break down who the best approach putters are. Approach putting? Who leaves the ball closest to the hole after their initial roll. Since many will use their flatstick off the green, this statistic is very helpful for the next two weeks. Players must avoid three-putting and manage their speed. These greens will be considerably slower than the John Deere, Travelers, and any other PGA TOUR venue they just played. Greens cannot be cut to insane speeds because of the wind. Should it start blowing and the greens are running 12+ on the Stimpmeter balls simply will not come to rest.\n\nWe saw putting separate the field at Memorial Park and it happens here as well. Past leaderboards contain a common thread of good links course putters. Notice I didn't say good putters. Slow greens and fescue turf is different from US conditions. It really makes a difference and the primary selection criteria needed to make our card. In the end, there's a large group of guys that bomb it. The group gets smaller when you consider the long iron skill needed, but still not small enough to select a profitable card. Compare putting skill, par 3 scoring (we have five of them), past Renaissance results, current form, and ball speed to find the names we need to build a full card at Read The Line.\n\nFor full coverage of the Scottish Open, subscribe to our Read The Line newsletter (it's free!) and follow us on Twitter!\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Betting alert \ud83d\udea8 Make sure you place all of your bets by Wednesday night. The Scottish Open is five hours ahead of the United States eastern time zone (New York City).\n\nThis is the 42nd Scottish Open. The last five have been contested at the Renaissance Club. Direct neighbors to the \"Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers\" (Muirfield), the Tom Doak design was created in 2008. Built with American ambition, each of the five Scottish Opens hosted here have been extremely entertaining. The first three even ended in a playoff. The past two have been a part of a collaboration destined to bring the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour together. The last two winners respectively are Rory McIlroy (2023) and Xander Schauffele (2022). Weather is the biggest influence on final score as in five years they winners have ranged from seven under par in 2022 to 22 under par in 2019 (in a playoff).\n\nThe forecast calls for rain leading into the championship. This will severely soften the playing conditions. With temperatures in the high 50s, don't expect the seaside links to dry out quickly. Compounding the scoring storyline, very little wind from the Firth of Forth is expected during the tournament. All of this can change in a minute, but if this forecast holds true, look for the winning score to push 20 under par again. The par 70 scorecard only measures 7,237 yards. With five par 3s, three par 5s, and 10 par 4s, players will be making an endless amount of birdies.\n\nTwo of the par 3s are under 165 yards, all three par 5s are reachable with little wind, and half of the par 4s are under 450 yards. Length becomes a huge advantage on links courses when the wind doesn't blow across the landscape. The entire field will get a break from the number one golfer in the world. Scottie Scheffler is not competing in the Scottish Open. Quite honestly, he can take every week off until the playoffs and still be the FedEx points leader! Six wins in mainly signature events and the Masters racks up the units. Rory McIlroy is not just the defending champion, but the betting favorite as well. Xander Schauffele sits a close second on the board, but Rors will be the favorite Thursday morning when we start.\n\nWe haven't seen McIlroy since the US Open. Not only will he have to answer questions about last month, and being defending champion, the Open Championship is next week. Rory hasn't played in close to a month and his last opportunity to break the ten year major drought is right around the corner. Looking for a little McIlroy preview... the last time The Open was played at Troon in 2016, he finished fifth. I expect Rory to be ready this week and in contention. The Renaissance Club is a perfect match for his game.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 2023 version of the Genesis Scottish Open was a memorable one. Rory McIlroy beat Scotland's Robert MacIntyre with an incredible birdie-birdie finish at the 17th and 18th holes.\n\nTom Kim and Tommy Fleetwood were the closest competitors to McIlroy heading into Sunday, but neither was able to mount a charge as it looked like McIlroy would cruise to a win. MacIntyre fired the low round of the day with a 64 to put the pressure on McIlroy and the other leaders but came up a shot short when it was all done. McIlroy will be looking to become the first back-to-back Scottish Open champion.\n\nMcIlroy will be making his first start since faltering down the stretch at the U.S. Open. Scottie Scheffler is sitting this one out after finishing T3 here last year. Some other top players in the field this week include Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, Wyndham Clark and Ludvig \u00c5berg. Justin Thomas is once again teeing it up at the Scottish Open where he will be hoping to break out of his poor course history and build on his excellent performance at the Travelers Championship.\n\nThe good thing about the Scottish Open setting up shop at the Renaissance Club is that we will be starting to see more solid trends when it comes to statistical profiles that play well at this golf course. The wind and weather will be key factors when it comes to making this tournament a challenge for the players. With five years' worth of statistics available for the Renaissance Club, my model will be focusing on driving distance, Par 3 scoring, strokes gained on approach from 175 yards to 200 yards, strokes gained on approach from over 200 yards and strokes gained around the green.\n\nFeatures: The Renaissance Club was designed by Tom Doak alongside player advisor P\u00e1draig Harrington to bring big-time tournament golf to a course owned by the Sarvadi family. This is the sixth year that the Renaissance Club has hosted the Scottish Open and the third edition as a co-sanctioned event between the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour.\n\nThe golf course features fescue grass from the tee boxes to the greens, with heavy fescue rough looking to gobble up wayward shots. The golf course has five Par 3s and three Par 5s. Two of the Par 3s can play below 160 yards, and all three Par 5s are reachable in two as long as the wind isn't blowing against the players.\n\nCollin Morikawa (+1400) is on the verge of breaking out and winning a tournament. He has gained strokes in every major category in four straight tournaments. Morikawa has gained at least 1.9 strokes off the tee in five straight tournaments with his placement making up for his lack of game-changing distance. The putter which held him back in 2023 has become a major weapon in his arsenal. He has gained three strokes or more putting in three of his last six tournaments.\n\nMin Woo Lee (+2800) has gained over 10 strokes combined off the tee in his last three tournaments. He has gained almost seven strokes combined around the green in his last two golf tournaments while gaining strokes with his putter in six straight tournaments.\n\nSungjae Im (+4500) has gained over 8.3 strokes on approach combined over his last two tournaments. I asked his caddie Willy Wilcox what was going on with Im's iron play after he struggled at The Memorial and the U.S. Open, and he assured me they had figured it out heading into the Travelers Championship. He was right. He has gained strokes across the board in his last two tournaments and looks to be getting back to where he was the last few years.\n\nBrian Harman (+4500) was a balky putter away from contending at the Travelers Championship. Harman gained strokes across the board on Sunday as he pushed his way up to a tie for ninth at the Travelers Championship and will be looking to prepare to defend his Open Championship win next week. He has gained strokes off the tee in three straight tournaments.\n\nEric Cole (+12500) is in excellent form right now. He has gained strokes across the board in two straight tournaments and could be getting back to being the ball striker we all know and loved in 2023, as he gained over 8.6 strokes combined in the ball striking category of his last two tournaments. I'm not going to ignore that form, even if this might not be the best golf course style for his game.\n\nRory McIlroy ($11,900) is head and shoulders above most of the players in this field when it comes to my model. The high price doesn't scare me, as there are many DP World Tour players in the 6K range that we can play in our McIlroy lineups to balance the budget. I expect McIlory to jump out of the gates fast to show that the U.S. Open missed putts are behind him, so I will be betting on him as the first-round leader at +2200 and using him in my lineups.\n\nLudvig \u00c5berg ($10,500) lost over seven strokes with his putter at the Travelers Championship, but I'm willing to look past that aberration. I expect Schauffele ($11,700) and Morikawa to soak up whatever is left from the ownership numbers in the 10K and above range, so \u00c5berg could be the sneaky play here. His around-the-green numbers are keeping him down a bit in my model, but I will still use him a lot.\n\nCollin Morikawa ($10,300) See above.\n\nTommy Fleetwood ($9,900) has three top-six finishes at this course and has four straight top-21 finishes on the PGA Tour. He is going to be very popular even at this high price. If you are playing a single-entry tournament, I may think about fading him. I will be using him in cash games this week despite having those thoughts in single-entry tournaments.\n\nTom Kim ($9,500) missed the cut at the Rocket Mortgage Classic after losing in a playoff at the Travelers Championship, but I'm not too worried about it this week. He has two straight top-six finishes here while gaining over 6.8 strokes combined on approach in those tournaments.\n\nHideki Matsuyama ($9,400) might go under the radar a bit this week with Fleetwood and Kim having such a great record here. Matsuyama pops in my model due to his excellent around-the-green game. He struggled with his irons at the Travelers Championship but gained over four strokes off the tee for the week.\n\nMin Woo Lee ($9,200) See above.\n\nCorey Conners ($8,900) has gained over 10 strokes combined around the green in his last three golf tournaments. He had his best finish at the Scottish Open last year, finishing inside the top 20, but it might be tough for him to pay off at this price.\n\nAaron Rai ($8,300) has gained more than 2.5 strokes on approach in six of his last seven golf tournaments. Rai has been on fire with his putter, gaining over 15.5 strokes combined with his putter in his last three tournaments. Rai is a solid Sunday away from winning a golf tournament.\n\nWyndham Clark ($8,100) might have found something at the Travelers Championship. He gained over 3.5 strokes on approach for the week and gained over four strokes with his putter. I like Clark as a sneaky play, hoping he can build on that performance.\n\nByeong Hun An ($7,600) withdrew from the Travelers Championship so I have some concerns, but it's hard to ignore how well he played here last year. He tied the course record in the first round.\n\nChristiaan Bezuidenhout ($7,500) has only missed one cut since the beginning of March and it was at the PGA Championship. His putting and around-the-green game should be an asset here. He has finished T16 here before, so he should have some confidence.\n\nRyan Fox ($7,100) has made the cut here three straight times, with his best finish being a T12 last year. He is coming off of a tournament where he gained over 3.8 strokes on approach at the BMW International Open.\n\nTom McKibbin ($7,000) has gained over 23.2 strokes ball striking over his last two tournaments combined on the DP World Tour.\n\nMatthieu Pavon ($6,900) looks to be finding his form from earlier in the year, but the around-the-green game will continue to haunt him if he can't find a consistent fix. He has gained over 8.1 strokes combined ball striking over his last two tournaments.\n\nEwen Ferguson ($6,700) is coming into this week off a huge win at the BMW International Open, where he gained over 7.5 strokes on approach. I expect a bit of a hangover, but his price is low enough to get some exposure with that type of ball-striking form.\n\nBen Griffin ($6,600) has gained over 2.8 strokes on approach in three straight tournaments and he gained over 10 strokes with his short game last week at the John Deere Classic.\n\nBernd Wiesberger ($6,600) co-owns the low-round record here and has the tournament record for scoring.\n\nJordan Smith ($6,600) finished T2 last week at the BMW International Open while gaining over 5.8 strokes on approach and finished T12 here last year.\n\nEric Cole ($6,400) See above.\n\nEach week, we will pick in reverse order of the standings, and we can't duplicate picks in the same week. Reference this spreadsheet tracking who we have used.\n\nKellenberger: We've gone long enough without Tommy Fleetwood winning on the PGA Tour that it's fair to wonder if it'll ever come or if he's something akin to this generation's Colin Montgomerie. When the breakthrough does happen, it stands to reason we don't really see it coming, but Fleetwood has a strong history at this event (T6 and T4 the last two years).\n\nMiller: Not only did Min Woo Lee first break out with a win at the Scottish Open three years ago, but he's also on a six-tournament run of T26 or better, including a T2 at the Rocket Mortgage. It's hard to trust Min Woo sometimes, but he's so good off the tee that I think it's a good week to back him.\n\nEsser: Denny McCarthy used a nice Sunday charge to push my lead a little bit further out this past week at the John Deere Classic. I wanted to take Tommy Fleetwood this week, but I already used him at the RBC Classic, and he was already taken by the time I got to pick. I'm expecting a nice bounce back from Tom Kim this week after he missed the cut at the Rocket Mortgage Classic. It was understandable that he would have a bit of a letdown after losing in a playoff at the Travelers Championship to Scheffler.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

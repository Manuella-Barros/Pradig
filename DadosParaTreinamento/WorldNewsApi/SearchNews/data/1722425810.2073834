Not bad for someone who only picked up the sport last year. \u201cSometimes, I wonder if I started tennis a bit too late. If I picked it up as a kid as opposed to last year, maybe you\u2019d see me on the court instead of a concert,\u201d wrote Chou. And deprive us of hits like Silence and Common Jasmine Orange? The video has since garnered over 2.9 million views with many of Jay\u2019s celeb followers such as Taiwanese rapper Shou Lou praising his court abilities. Professional tennis player Tseng Chun Hsin wrote: \u201cIf you started as a child, the Taiwanese version of Roger Federer would have been born\u201d. Crazy Rich Asians and Wicked director, Jon M Chu, too, was impressed, commenting: \u201cKilling that slice\u201d. However, not all of Chou's fans were thrilled with the idea. One said: \u201cIf you started playing tennis in elementary school, the Chinese music scene would have been ruined\u201d. Another hilariously wrote: \u201cIf I don\u2019t sing your songs, then whose music should I listen to?\u201d The Mojito singer and his wife, Hannah Quinlivan, have clearly developed a passion for tennis. In addition to hitting the court regularly, they have also been seen at Grand Slams such as the Australian Open, where they were spotted rubbing shoulders with tennis legend Roger Federer.

State Rep. Bill Hauter, R-Morton, said this estimate likely understates the cost of building a prison in the Chicago suburbs.\n\n* Triibe | Prison educators and abolitionists have mixed feelings about Pritzker's proposal to rebuild Stateville and Logan correctional facilities: \"I give him [Pritzker] credit for saying these buildings are terrible, and we need to just tear them down. I'm gonna give him credit for that,\" Avalon Betts-Gaston said. She's the executive director of the Illinois Alliance for Reentry & Justice, which aims to create alternatives to incarceration, reduce recidivism, and end mass incarceration. However, Betts-Gaston disagrees with state officials building new multi-million dollar carceral facilities while the root causes of crime and violence still aren't being addressed.\n\n* Illinois Times | Legislation would support local journalism: The number of journalism jobs at Illinois newspapers has dropped 86% since 2005, but press advocates see signs of hope in proposed college scholarships, state tax credits, scholarships and other subsidies to benefit local news outlets. \"I'm cautiously optimistic we will see something,\" Sam Fisher, former president of the Illinois Press Association, said as the scheduled May 24 adjournment of the Illinois General Assembly's spring session approaches.\n\n* Daily Herald | 'Time for action is now': Wheaton residents call for pedestrian traffic light on Roosevelt Road: Wheaton residents and educators implored state lawmakers to help save lives and fund a stoplight on a perilous stretch of Roosevelt Road at a Wednesday hearing in Springfield. \"The time for action is now,\" said resident Debbie Suggs, 77. \"Every day of inaction brings us closer to another tragedy.\" Community members, including Marian Park apartment dwellers and St. Francis High School leaders, are seeking help to pay for a traffic light at Roosevelt, east of County Farm Road.\n\n* NBC Chicago | Ascension hospitals report 'disruptions' to clinic operations following suspected cyber attack: The hospital system announced the disruption Wednesday, saying it had \"detected unusual activity on select technology systems.\"\"At this time we continue to investigate the situation,\" the hospital operator's statement read in part. \"We responded immediately, initiated our investigation and activated our remediation efforts.\"\n\n* Chalkbeat | Not just oppression: Lessons from one state on how schools can get Asian American history right: The work happening in Illinois offers insight into what can help. It's common for teachers to feel overwhelmed and think: \"I need to teach this, I don't even fully know this yet,\" said Ouk, the visiting inclusive education director at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's College of Education. To address that, teacher trainers say they're modeling lessons, showing teachers where Asian American voices and experiences naturally fit within existing curriculum, and sharing strategies that are useful for teaching the history of many marginalized groups.\n\n* NPR | Their first baby came with medical debt. These Illinois parents won't have another: The first-time mother, a high school teacher in rural Illinois, had developed high blood pressure, a sometimes life-threatening condition in pregnancy that prompted doctors to hospitalize her. Then [Heather Crivilare's] blood pressure spiked, and the baby's heart rate dropped. \"It was terrifying,\" Crivilare said. She gave birth to a healthy daughter. What followed, though, was another ordeal: thousands of dollars in medical debt that sent Crivilare and her husband scrambling for nearly a year to keep collectors at bay.\n\n* WTTW | Johnson's Senior Leadership Team More Diverse Than Previous Mayors' Cabinets: Analysis: In all, the 34 appointments Johnson made between May 2023 and April 2024 that require confirmation by the Chicago City Council reflect the city's racial diversity, as measured by the 2020 census, more closely than the appointments made by his two predecessors, former Mayors Lori Lightfoot and Rahm Emanuel. The second Black man elected Chicago mayor, Johnson tapped more Black Chicagoans to serve in positions of authority than Chicagoans of other races, according to WTTW News' analysis.\n\n* Block Club | Police Rapidly Caught A Cop Killer. Families Of Slain Chicagoans Wonder: What About Us?: The group rallied Tuesday afternoon outside Chicago Police Area 1 Homicide Department, 5101 S. Wentworth Ave., to demand police resolve the investigations into their loved ones' deaths with the same urgency as they did the fatal shooting of Officer Luis Huesca. A third of all murders recorded in 2023 in Chicago happened within the Area 1 boundaries, Chicago Police Department data shows. \"Some of these mothers have been waiting for two years for justice. Officer Huesca's mother, all she needed was 10 days,\" said Baltazar Enriquez, director of Mother and Families United for Justice Committee of Chicago, a committee of the Little Village Community Council.\n\n* WTTW | Disgraced Detective Reynaldo Guevara Collecting $91K Annual Pension as Cost of His Misconduct Hits $62.5M With 33 Lawsuits Pending: In all, Guevara has banked more than $1.4 million in pension payments since he retired on June 15, 2005, having spent 32 years, two months and 27 days as a police officer and an employee of the Chicago Park District, according to records obtained by WTTW News through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\n* Block Club | CHA Residents Rip CEO At Hearing: 'We Need Something Much Better Than This': Scott faced withering criticism and calls to resign from residents and even a member of the CHA's governing board.

Several resident leaders ripped Scott for rarely visiting CHA properties.\"Tracey Scott, you seem to have forgotten that you are a guest here at CHA -- you have outstayed your welcome,\" said Francine Washington, speaking directly to Scott. Washington, a longtime CHA resident, has served on the CHA board since 2014.\n\n* Chicago | Frustrations rise after 9-year-old girl attacked by unleashed dog in Horner Park: 'She was traumatized': The attack has left some residents with mounting frustrations toward unleashed dogs in public. Just a few hundred feet from the attack is a gated, 25,000-square-foot designated dog park. \"There's no reason this should have happened,\" Sieracki said. \"A kid should be able to go play on the grass and do cartwheels and not have to worry about being attacked by dogs.\"\n\n* WBEZ | You don't have to be famous -- or even from Chicago -- to get an honorary street sign: Chicago started commemorating people who left their mark on the city through honorary street signs starting in the 1960s. It was an easier way to celebrate notable people without the logistical nightmare of officially changing a street name. The system was formalized in 1984 and has been in place since, with some tweaks over the years to try to slow down overzealous alderpeople. Today, you'll find the little brown signs in every ward of Chicago, informally paying tribute along one or two designated blocks.\n\n* Daily Herald | Republican leaders slating legislative candidates despite new law banning it: Suburban Republican Party leaders are slating candidates for state legislative races that didn't draw primary contenders despite a new law designed to prevent such aspirants from being considered by voters.

The board then will consider any challenges to those petitions filed by June 10 -- again, as scheduled.\n\n* Daily Herald | Campton Hills trustee resigns amid legal fight with state's attorney: After barely serving a year, Campton Hills Trustee Timothy Morgan resigned at the end of Tuesday's village board meeting.

Morgan was elected last year, but a 2002 felony DUI conviction in Michigan dogged his ability to keep his seat.\n\n* Pioneer Press | Arlington Heights School District 25 nurse fired over allegations of mishandling students' meds: The Arlington Heights School District 25 Board of Education voted to fire the nurse at the center of a case the district has called a misuse of prescription medications, with the board president calling the situation a \"breach of trust\" that is \"distressing and concerning.\" The board voted 6-0 at a special meeting Wednesday night to fire registered nurse Tory Eitz, who had been the nurse at Westgate Elementary School for five years. Westgate is one of nine schools in District 25 and enrolls nearly 600 students in grades K to 5.\n\n* Illinois Times | Renovations, repairs ramping up at state fairgrounds: \"Spring means construction here on the Illinois State Fairgrounds. And we're still in the middle of a $58 million economic investment in the fairgrounds to address years of deferred maintenance,\" said Rebecca Clark, Illinois State Fair manager. After completing the Coliseum roof overhaul in 2019, the crew now tackles a $16.8 million transformation.\n\n* WCIA | Springfield rolls out new crisis plan for severe weather, other emergencies: City officials said the plan was developed using lessons learned from last year's derecho, which wreaked havoc on Springfield's power grid. The crisis highlighted the need for effective communication during such an emergency; since then, officials worked to create a robust crisis communication strategy that ensures timely and accurate information when people need it most.\n\n* SJ-R | Ace Hardware acquires local franchise Bishop Ace across central Illinois: On May 9, a division of the Ace Hardware corporation announced the agreement to acquire Bishop Ace Hardware, a local 13-store chain in central Illinois which partnered with Ace in 1960.

According to a new report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) exclusively shared with Yahoo Finance, the Latino uninsured rate in the US stands at 18%, twice as high as the US average.\n\n* AP | Guns are being stolen from cars at triple the rate they were 10 years ago, a report finds: The rate of stolen guns from cars climbed nearly every year and spiked during the coronavirus pandemic along with a major surge in weapons purchases in the U.S., according to the report, which analyzes FBI data from 337 cities in 44 states and was provided to The Associated Press. The stolen weapons have, in some cases, turned up at crime scenes. In July 2021, a gun taken from an unlocked car in Riverside, Florida, was used to kill a 27-year-old Coast Guard member as she tried to stop a car burglary in her neighborhood.\n\n* NYT | Cass Elliot's Death Spawned a Horrible Myth. She Deserves Better.: Elliot was a charismatic performer who exuded infectious joy and a magnificent vocalist with acting chops she did not live to fully explore. July 29 is the 50th anniversary of her untimely death at 32, a tragedy that still spurs unanswerable questions. Might Elliot, who was one of Johnny Carson's most beloved substitutes, have become the first female late-night talk show host? Would she have achieved EGOT status? [...] For years, the origin of the story that Elliot died from choking on a ham sandwich -- one of the cruelest and most persistent myths in rock 'n' roll history -- was largely unknown. Then in 2020, Elliot's friend Sue Cameron, an entertainment journalist, admitted to publicizing it in her Hollywood Reporter obituary at the behest of Elliot's manager Allan Carr, who did not want his client associated with drug use. (Elliot died of a heart attack, likely brought on by years of substance abuse and crash dieting.)\n\n* Poynter | Gannett fired an editor for talking to me: Sarah Leach, an experienced editor overseeing 26 Gannett community papers in four states, was fired via video conference first thing the morning of Monday, April 29. She was accused, she said, of \"sharing proprietary information with (a reporter for) a competing media company.\" [...] Lyons did not say how the company identified her as a source.

The high unemployment rate has exacerbated concerns about the state's fiscal health.\n\nThe oppressive tax structure and high crime rates in Illinois, particularly in Chicago, drive economic stagnation and force businesses and residents to leave the state. In turn, the state lost approximately 32,826 people in the year leading up to July 2023. This decline marks a significant departure from the state population of 12,549,689, which was more than a quarter of a million less than in April 2020. This trend mirrors similar population losses in other high-tax states like California, which have resulted in substantial budget deficits.\n\nIn line with that, Illinois pension debt continues to escalate, growing by $2.6 billion in 2023 alone, reaching a staggering $142.3 billion in unfunded liabilities. A 1970 state constitution prohibits the diminishment or impairment of pension benefits, including cost-of-living adjustments. State accountants then project a budget deficit of $891 million in the upcoming fiscal year, further exacerbating the financial strain.\n\nDuring a State of the State address in February, Governor J.B. Pritzker proposed raising taxes on sportsbooks and extending the cap on business tax deductions for operating losses to generate approximately $726 million in additional revenue. However, even with these measures, the state is still projected to face a significant budget deficit of $891 million in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

In 2023 alone, we attracted billions of dollars in new business investments and created tens of thousands of new jobs.\"\n\nConservative think tanks have now grouped Illinois with other blue states like New York and California, which have also experienced significant population exodus amid various challenges ranging from immigration to crime. (Related: FLEEING TYRANNY: Report reveals Illinois tops list of states Americans fled in 2022.)\n\n\"Unemployment rates are very high; wage growth is lagging compared to most other states,\" said Bryce Hill, the director of fiscal and economic research, at the Illinois Policy Institute. \"The Census Bureau has reported that residents are leaving the state en masse to the tune of hundreds of thousands every single year, so much so that the state's population has actually been declining for the past 10 years. So on any metric, quantitatively on outcomes, Illinois' economy is lagging.\"\n\nDespite assurances from the government, Hill warned that the budget deficit, combined with ongoing migration out of the state, will only deepen Illinois' economic challenges.\n\n\"While migration contributes to the state's financial woes, it is not the root cause,\" Hill explained. \"Illinois also faces the significant challenge of unfunded pension liabilities, which are draining state and local government budgets and impeding revenue generation.\"\n\nS. T. Karnick, a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, also echoed similar statements.\n\n\"Illinois is in awful shape in many ways, and its economy is dreadful,\" said Karnick. \"Opinion polls cite high taxes as the top reason people want to leave Illinois, with crime and safety second. Illinois has the fourth-most regulations among the 50 states, which raises prices and kills jobs.\"\n\n\"Those are all things entirely under the control of the state government. For decades, the Illinois government has paid much more attention to the well-being of government workers than to taxpayers. The state has the nation's worst pension-funding crisis -- which is saying a lot -- with an unfunded liability of more than $140 billion.\n\n\"Illinois is caught in a destructive-governance spiral. Bad government diminishes residents' living conditions and returns on business investment. People move out or work less, and businesses leave the state or reduce operations. Those actions decrease the tax base, so the state raises tax rates and uses accounting tricks to meet spending goals. That makes things even worse and further damages the state's economy. More productive people and businesses leave.

The economic landscape is gradually improving, with inflation now stable at twoper cent and the boost from the Bank of England's recent interest rate cut. As these positive changes begin to impact personal finances, we anticipate more private buyers entering the market, leading to more balanced growth across all sectors.\"\n\nRichard Peberdy, UK head of automotive for KPMG, said: \"New car sales are up on this time last year, with fleets continuing to be the driver of growth in the market. Benefit-in-kind and salary sacrifice incentives for business have been the major driver of growth in EV sales and market share for some time now. The evidence increasingly suggests that accelerating private EV sales may require similar incentivisation, particularly if the government is going to reinstate the 2030 end to new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.\n\n\"While choices in the new car market are improving, EV prices and the scale and rate of price depreciation when buying from new remain major barriers to convincing consumers to buy a new EV. Subsequently, many consumers that are looking to transition to an EV are deciding that the used EV market is a more attractive way to do that.\n\n\"Despite used EV sales growing, the higher rate of stock that is currently coming into the used market is still pushing the price of some models down even further.\"\n\nIan Plummer, commercial director at online vehicle marketplace Auto Trader, said: \"Overall, July marked another lacklustre month for the new car market, as the strong performance in fleet channels struggled to offset the ongoing retail decline.\n\n\"The bright spot is a strong consumer move to low-emission cars, which so far this year have accounted for almost half of all new car sales, up from around just one in 10 in 2019.\n\n\"Manufacturers are also working hard to tempt buyers with enticing offers, as shown by a 20 per cent rise in new car advert views on our platform in July.\n\n\"That offers some optimism as we approach the key plate change month of September.\"",

Private demand continued to diminish, falling by -11.1% to account for 36.2% of deliveries in the month, although the growing popularity of salary sacrifice purchasing will contribute to this decline.\n\nElectrified vehicle demand outpaced the overall market, accounting for four in 10 (42.0%) new cars registered in the month. Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) uptake increased by 31.4% to achieve a 14.5% market share, while plug-in hybrids (PHEV) grew 12.4% to take 8.9% of registrations.\n\nBattery electric vehicle (BEV) volumes, meanwhile, were up 18.8%, resulting in an overall market share of 18.5%. While the private share of the BEV market continues to fall (17.2% went private buyers, compared with 20.3% last year) private BEV volumes did increase by a marginal 0.9%. Overall, BEVs account for 16.8% of the new car market, year to date.\n\nWith zero-emission vehicles mandated to comprise a minimum 22% of each brand's new car registrations over the full year, the pace of transition needs to increase significantly, says SMMT. The latest industry outlook, however, suggests that such a surge is looking increasingly unlikely given the current market conditions.\n\nWhile the outlook anticipates overall market growth in 2024, expectations have been revised downwards since April, with 1.968 million new car registrations now forecast by the end of the year. The anticipated BEV share of the market has also been revised downwards to 18.5% from the 19.8% expected in April.\n\nSays Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive:\n\n\"Two years of new car market growth against a backdrop of a turbulent economy is testament to the sector's resilience and the attractiveness of the deals on offer.

While almost one in five new cars sold last month were electric, demand still lags behind what is required by the strict ZEV mandate rules.\n\nIn July 2024, market share for EVs rose by 18.8 per cent to an overall share of 18.5 per cent. This may seem like good news for the UK's transition to electric power, but EV market share still idles at just 16.5 per cent year-to-date, which is a long way away from the 19.8 per cent that the industry was previously hoping to achieve by the end of 2024 and the 22 per cent required for each manufacturer under the new ZEV mandate rules.\n\nThe drive to increase EV sales isn't helped by waning support from private buyers; the cost of buying a new electric car remains relatively high compared to the petrol equivalent, despite the arrival of some cheaper new EV models in recent months. Thus, units sold privately account for roughly only 17 per cent of EV registrations, despite the overall volume of sales rising marginally by around one per cent.\n\nRepresenting the UK's car industry, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) chief executive, Mike Hawes, said that the muted private demand for EVs is \"the over-riding concern\".\n\n\"More people than ever are buying and driving EVs but we still need the pace of change to quicken, else the UK's climate change ambitions are threatened and manufacturers' ability to hit regulated EV targets are at risk.\"\n\nHawes called for the UK government to bring \"action on incentives\" - the SMMT previously called for VAT to be slashed on EVs bought privately, as well as a tax cut on public charging - ahead of the new 74-registration plate coming in September.\n\nIt's not all bad news, though; car sales overall were up by 2.5 per cent last month, marking two years of sustained growth since the COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical events, took their toll on the industry.\n\nNow, the SMMT expects the Bank of England's recent cut in interest rates to make car finance cheaper and more accessible than it was before, catering to what it calls a \"pent-up demand\".", "source": {"uri": "autoexpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Auto Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Motor_Manufacturers_and_Traders", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.autoexpress.co.uk/image/private/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1712595246/autoexpress/2024/04/V5C document (2024).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791062", "eventUri": "eng-9791062", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

government-set target of 22%.\n\nThis comes after 18.5% of the 147,517 new car registrations in July were battery-electric vehicles, with the overall market growing 2.5%.\n\n\"With zero emission

19.8% previously.\n\n\"The latest industry outlook, however, suggests that such a surge is looking increasingly unlikely given the current market conditions.\"\n\nManufacturers have had to ensure a proportion of their annual sales are made up of zero-emission vehicles, such as battery electrics, since January this year, with fines set for those that miss these.\n\nThis mandate was announced last year to replace the UK's previous target to phase out new petrol and diesel sales by 2030, with 100% zero emission sales now required by 2035.\n\nGiven sluggish demand, SMMT boss Mike Hawes argued

In April, it forecast that battery cars would account for 19.8% of sales during 2024, while it puts that figure at 18.5%.\n\nSome manufacturers are worried they will miss EV targets set by the UK government. Under the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, 22% of each carmaker's sales must be pure battery cars in 2024, rising to 80% by 2030. However, manufacturers receive some exemptions for selling other types of car, and they can also borrow credits from other manufacturers.\n\nThe mandate is meant to push manufacturers to accelerate EV sales before a total ban on cars that emit carbon dioxide. Labour has said it will reintroduce a plan to ban new petrol and diesel car sales in 2030, after the former prime minister Rishi Sunak delayed it until 2035.\n\nMike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said the sector was resilient, given that UK sales had risen 5.5% this year compared with the first seven months of last year. However, he said he was worried that the industry would not meet the government's targets.\n\n\"Weakening private retail demand, particularly for EVs and despite generous manufacturer discounts, is the overriding concern,\" Hawes said. \"More people than ever are buying and driving EVs but we still need the pace of change to quicken, or else the UK's climate change ambitions are threatened and manufacturers' ability to hit regulated EV targets is at risk.\"\n\nCarmakers have continued to sell mostly petrol and some diesel cars because they remain more profitable to make than battery cars, particularly as slowing demand and rapidly increasing competition from new Chinese entrants has put pressure on electric car prices.\n\nSome carmakers have played hardball with governments in the UK and EU over emissions regulations. Stellantis, the owner of brands including Fiat, Peugeot and Vauxhall, claimed in June that it could close British factories if the UK government did not loosen sales regulations, despite most of its products being due for export.\n\nOverall UK car sales have grown year on year in every month for the last two years as the industry recovered from the slump in sales during the pandemic. There have been 1.15m sales so far in 2024, 60,000 more than last year.\n\nHowever, a slowing global economy and higher interest rates have weighed on sales growth. The SMMT also downgraded its expectations for petrol and diesel sales.

Overall, BEVs account for 16.8% of the new car market, year to date.\n\nElectric fleet registrations\n\nSeparate figures from Cap HPI show that fleet BEV registrations have risen to 41% market share year to date.\n\nIts latest Insight Report highlights that, while BEV's market share is 10% lower than in the same period last year, PHEV's share is almost 10% higher.\n\nThe share of all alternative fuel vehicles (electric/BEV, plugin hybrid/PHEV, and hybrid/HEV) remained stable at over 70% between 2024 and the same period in 2023.\n\nAndrew Turner, senior product specialist at Cap HPI consulting, said: \"The mix for alternative vehicles has changed, with PHEV and HEV rising and BEV falling.\"\n\nFuel\n\nJan-Jun 24 Share\n\nJan-Jun 23 Share\n\nDiesel\n\n4.1%\n\n4.9%\n\nPetrol\n\n25.8%\n\n23.9%\n\nBEV\n\n41.0%\n\n51.8%\n\nPHEV\n\n23.0%\n\n14.5%\n\nHEV\n\n6.1%\n\n4.9%\n\nSource: Cap HPI\n\nHe continued: \"Overall, the Insight market is fairly flat compared to the same period in 2023, and this may be driven by the slowdown in electric car (BEV) registrations, given their popularity in this sector.\"\n\nCap HPI's June data shows the Tesla Model Y topping the table, followed by the Tesla Model 3, Audi Q4, and Audi A3.

be interesting to see how a wider range of models and price points will impact the BEV share of the market over the coming months.\"\n\nFleet dominates new car market\n\nLooking at SMMT new car data for July, fleet and business registrations increased more than 12% year-on-year with 94,161 cars registered, equating to 63% of the market.\n\nYear-to-date, the fleet and business sector now holds 62% of the market, with 718,035 registrations, a 20% uplift on the 598,270 new cars registered over the same period last year.\n\nOverall, the new car market rose by 2.5% in July, delivering two years of consecutive growth, with 147,517 new cars registered - the best performance for July since 2020.\n\nWhile the SMMT outlook anticipates overall market growth in 2024, expectations have been revised downwards since April, with 1.968 million new car registrations now forecast by the end of the year.\n\nThe anticipated BEV share of the market has also been revised downwards to 18.5% from the 19.8% expected in April.\n\nLast week's interest rate cut was already 'priced in' to the latest outlook but the SMMT says that further cuts would be welcome, helping reduce the costs of finance and making new car purchases more accessible to more consumers.\n\nWith zero emission vehicles mandated to comprise a minimum 22% of each brand's new car registrations over the full year, the trade body argues the pace of transition needs to increase significantly.\n\nHowever, its latest industry outlook suggests that such a surge is looking increasingly unlikely given the current market conditions.\n\nMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \"Two years of new car market growth against a backdrop of a turbulent economy is testament to the sector's resilience and the attractiveness of the deals on offer.\n\n\"Weakening private retail demand, however, particularly for EVs and despite generous manufacturer discounts, is the over-riding concern.\n\n\"More people than ever are buying and driving EVs but we still need the pace of change to quicken, else the UK's climate change ambitions are threatened and manufacturers' ability to hit regulated EV targets are at risk.\n\n\"Achieving market transition at the pace demanded requires greater support for consumers and, with the all-important new numberplate month of September beckoning, action on incentives and infrastructure is needed now.\"\n\nPhilip Nothard, insight director at Cox Automotive, says that a healthy retail market is \"vital\" for manufacturers' long-term profitability.\n\n\"Although BEV uptake is rising, it still falls short of mandated targets,\" he explained. \"However, the potential for BEVs is significant, and we expect them to play a major role in the market outlook for 2025.\n\n\"It is too soon to know what impact, if any, the new Government's growth plans will have on consumer confidence, though the Bank of England's base rate reduction last week was a positive and welcome sign.\n\n\"Our baseline forecast is marginally more optimistic than the SMMT's projections, but we continue to monitor movements closely and caution that Q4 could see some dramatic movements as manufacturers manoeuvre to avoid ZEV penalties.\"\n\nRichard Peberdy, UK head of automotive for KPMG, believes that benefit-in-kind (BIK) and salary sacrifice incentives for business have been the major driver of growth in EV sales and market share for some time now.\n\n\"The evidence increasingly suggests that accelerating private EV sales may require similar incentivisation, particularly if the Government is going to reinstate the 2030 end to new petrol and diesel vehicle sales,\" he said.\n\n\"While choices in the new car market are improving, EV prices and the scale and rate of price depreciation when buying from new remain major barriers to convincing consumers to buy a new EV.\n\n\"Subsequently, many consumers that are looking to transition to an EV are deciding that the used EV market is a more attractive way to do that.\n\n\"Despite used EV sales growing, the higher rate of stock that is currently coming into the used market is still pushing the price of some models down even further.\n\n\"All of this context continues to pose big questions regarding how car makers will meet their Zero Emission Mandate targets.\"\n\nJamie Hamilton, automotive partner and head of electric vehicles at Deloitte, added: \"Despite the battery electric vehicle sector outperforming the rest of the market, the industry requires continued clarity on the ban of new petrol and diesel car sales so that it can plan investments accordingly.\n\n\"If the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales is to be maintained or moved forward, we can expect further calls from within the industry for financial incentives on electric vehicles to support demand.\n\n\"In the meantime, for consumers seeking more affordable options, there are cheaper electric vehicle models becoming available, including a number of new brands entering the market.\"\n\nKim Royds, mobility director at Centrica, believes that more work needs to be done to remove barriers to adoption and give drivers the confidence to make the switch.\n\n\"Without a doubt, tackling the inequality that exists between at home and public charging should remain a top priority,\" she said.\n\n\"A large proportion of homeowners live without access to a driveway and therefore are restricted from unlocking the main benefits of going electric.\n\n\"Creating at home and kerbside charge point solutions with affordable charging costs must be high on the list for industry leaders and policymakers to ensure that nobody is left behind.\"", "source": {"uri": "fleetnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "FNN - Fleet NewsNet"}, "authors":

However, the strongest growth in sales came from hybrids, which grew by 23pc on a year-on-year basis. Within this, standard hybrid sales grew by 31.4pc and plug-in hybrid sales grew by 12.4pc.\n\nMeanwhile, most new EV sales continued to come from \"fleet\" buyers such as car rental businesses and white collar workers using company car schemes, the SMMT figures show.\n\nPrivate buyers have accounted for 19.4pc of EV sales in the first seven months of 2024, down from 23.7pc over the same period last year and half the average for the new car market overall.\n\nExperts have blamed this trend on the price of EVs, which remain more expensive upfront than most petrol, diesel and hybrid cars, as well as a lack of financial incentives for private buyers.\n\nThe plug-in grant for private consumers was scrapped in 2022, whereas businesses that buy EVs and employees who lease them through salary sacrifice schemes continue to make tax savings.\n\nAt the same time, car manufacturers must meet tough zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules that were brought into force in Britain this year.\n\nThese require 22pc of their sales to be electric this year, rising gradually to 80pc by 2030.\n\nInitially, manufacturers can trade carbon credits and use other mechanisms if they miss their quotas. But this will become harder in later years, with breaches of the mandate potentially resulting in fines of \u00a315,000 for every car over their limit.\n\nSome companies have said they could reduce petrol car sales in Britain to artificially raise their proportion of EV sales, with Vauxhall owner Stellantis warning it may even close its British factories unless the Government waters down the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer's administration has previously vowed to toughen up the rules by bringing a planned ban on new sales of petrol cars back to 2030, after Rishi Sunak delayed it until 2035.\n\nRichard Peberdy, UK head of automotive at consultancy giant KPMG, said many consumers were turning to the used car market to buy EVs amid concerns about depreciation in value.\n\nHe said: \"The evidence increasingly suggests that accelerating private EV sales may require similar incentivisation, particularly if the Government is going to reinstate the 2030 end to new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.\n\n\"While choices in the new car market are improving, EV prices - and the scale and rate of price depreciation when buying from new - remain major barriers to convincing consumers to buy a new EV.\n\n\"Subsequently, many consumers that are looking to transition to an EV are deciding that the used EV market is a more attractive way to do that.\n\n\"Despite used EV sales growing, the higher rate of stock that is currently coming into the used market is still pushing the price of some models down even further.\n\n\"All of this context continues to pose big questions regarding how car makers will meet their [ZEV] mandate targets.\"\n\nHowever, Jamie Hamilton, automotive partner and head of electric vehicles at Deloitte, suggested falling interest rates may also help to rekindle demand, as many people buy new EVs on car finance deals.\n\nLast week, the Bank of England announced its first interest rate cut since 2020.\n\nMr Hamilton said: \"We are seeing some signals in the market that consumer sentiment is rising.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It is now predicted by data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) that just 18.5% of overall car sales will be BEV by the end of 2024.\n\nThat's because the bulk of BEV sales come from commercial fleets that enjoy substantial financial subsidies to make the switch from ICE-powered vehicles. Retail sales from private vehicle owners, who lack these subsidies, increased by a measly 0.9% and fell by -17.2% as a share of the overall BEV market.\n\nThe real danger for the U.K. market is that, should the current trend of slowdown among consumers turning to BEVs become a medium- to long-term trend, new-car sales could fall off a cliff in 2035 unless the government falls in line with the EU's proposals to leave the door open to further development of clean ICE technology.\n\nMeanwhile, gas-hybrid vehicles outpaced the overall market in July, accounting for 42% of new cars registered in the month. Hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) uptake increased 31.4% to achieve a 14.5% market share, while plug-in hybrids (PHEV) grew 12.4% to take 8.9% of registrations.\n\nOverall the U.K. new-car market rose just 2.5% with 147,517 new cars reaching the road which, nonetheless, was the best performance for July since 2020, when a re-opening of dealerships following four months of lockdown saw a surge in deliveries to fulfill pent-up demand.\n\nMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: \"Weakening private retail demand, however, particularly for EVs, and despite generous manufacturer discounts, is the overriding concern. More people than ever are buying and driving EVs but we still need the pace of change to quicken, else the U.K.'s climate change ambitions are threatened and manufacturers' ability to hit regulated EV targets are at risk.", "source": {"uri": "wardsauto.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ward's Communications Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-neutral fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Motor_Manufacturers_and_Traders", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt7121b6ec5c11097b/blt2e9b1a82c8b3bf26/66b0a4273cadcfe473d531f5/ToyotaC-HRPHEV.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791062", "eventUri": "eng-9791062", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Dallas is one of the many experienced flight attendants who have revealed what they or other travelers should never do during a flight. A video posted by Cher Dallas (@cherdallas) on TikTok in January 2024 resurfaced online this month in which she revealed three things she wouldn't do as a flight attendant @cherdallas Listen to me or dont im just trying to save u #airplanestory #aviationlovers #crewscheduler #flightattendant #flightattendantlife #aviationlife #flightattendantstories #falifestyle\u2708\ufe0f #airportlife #fa #crazyplanelady #travelhacks #airplanevideos \u266c Storytelling - Adriel Read More I'm a flight attendant and here's why passengers should NEVER hit on crew they fancy while flying (though there is one window of opportunity... ) Dallas was doing her makeup in a bathroom while explaining three things she'd never do on a plane in her first video. While applying makeup, she revealed that wearing shorts is something she wouldn't do on a plane. 'It's for so many reasons, but it's going to be cold, and you're going to freeze to death,' said Dallas. Another scenario she used to support the first thing was if an evacuation were to occur, one's 'butt cheeks are going to be sizzled off' if they go down the slide in shorts. Shorts are a big no for this flight attendant, as well booking less than a three-hour connection between flights. 'Delays can happen for a million and one reasons. The likelihood that you'll miss your connection is pretty high if you're booking shorter than three hours,' said Dallas. When she is on the plane as a flight attendant or only as a passenger, she never uses the aircraft bathrooms' toilet paper. 'If you examine the toilet paper, I promise you're going to see water droplets on it or what you think are water droplets... I tell all my ladies to use Kleenex instead,' said Dallas. Dallas' first video about what she doesn't do on flights has received nearly 800,000 views, which could be part of why she posted additional videos a month afterward. Dallas revealed in her first video that she would never book flights that have less than a three-hour connection between them Dallas hinted that some of her never-do actions on planes could also apply to travelers as she explained three more things she'd never do. 'I would never ring my call bell to hand a flight attendant trash,' she said. 'Flight attendants go through the aisle on average about every 10 minutes of the flight to pick up your trash. I would never go up to the front and leave my trash on the galley counter.' Dallas also revealed that she would never do anything that involves trash and when she will or won't take it during a flight. 'When flight attendants are coming through and serving food or drinks, I would never try to hand them my trash, because that's not sanitary,' said Dallas. The experienced flight attendant added that anyone who wishes to get rid of their trash beforehand can get out of their seat and throw it away in the bathroom if it's not occupied. Dallas used one of her videos to discuss what she and other passengers would do regarding trash disposal on flights Dallas revealed that she would never attempt to use the bathroom while a flight attendant is doing service do to a risk of injury from their cart Dallas began her third video by explaining why she wouldn't use the bathroom while flight attendants are doing service. According to the TikToker, she would never try to squeeze past a cart because 'it can easily pin you between the seat and that 200-pound cart.' Dallas then revealed that she wouldn't even ask a flight attendant to give her food or drinks right when she walks on the plane. 'I'm not asking unless I have to take medication when I walk on the plane. We have too many other things to do to be serving sodas and snacks to everybody during boarding,' Dallas said. Once the flight touches down at Dallas' potential final destination, she would never stand up when the plane lands as it is 'not a safe time for someone to be standing up.' She also won't stand up as soon as the pilot turns off the seatbelt sign because it will actually 'slow down the deplaning process.' Besides Dallas, flight attendant Aislinn Swain revealed things she would never do onboard a plane, which, like the TikToker with five years of experience, includes not handing in garbage. Flight attendant Aislinn Swain revealed things she would never do onboard a plane, which includes asking for ice in her drink Swain recommended that travelers do not eat ice on a plane do the risk of dirt that can get onto the cubes from the ground or gloves that flight attendants may not change. Swain also advises travelers to pack sunscreen for any trip and wear shoes on their feet. 'I'd recommend keeping your shoes on the whole flight because I'm sure your feet are stinky and your neighbors, and the rest of the plane, don't want to smell that,' said Swain. 'Shoes should definitely remain on during takeoff and landing.'

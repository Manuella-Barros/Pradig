Abreu had two RBIs for Boston, which had lost seven of nine games since the All-Star break.\n\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora said the key to the inning was Jarren Duran hustling to beat out a potential inning-ending, double-play grounder before Abreu's at-bat.\n\n\"That changed the game, then Abreu puts on that at-bat,\" Cora said. \"He beat him with the fastball his first at-bat. He went to the fastball a lot in that one, and Wily just stayed on him. ... That was an awesome at-bat.\"\n\nDominic Smith added a solo homer and two RBIs, Romy Gonzalez hit a pinch-hit two run shot and the Red Sox had a season-high eight doubles.\n\nNick Pivetta (5-7) struck out 10 and allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings.\n\nRandy Arozarena and Cal Raleigh hit solo homers for the Mariners, who had a three-game winning streak halted.\n\nSeattle's Logan Gilbert (6-7) was tagged for seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. The 27-year-old righty had held opponents to one or no earned runs in 11 of his previous 21 starts. Against Boston, his night unraveled quickly with two outs in the third inning.\n\nWith a runner on third and two outs after his wild pitch allowed Connor Wong to score the first run, Abreu had fallen into an 0-2 hole before battling back to a full count. He then fouled off five straight pitches before hitting a ground single to right that made it 2-0.\n\nAbreu yelled into the Red Sox dugout as he was running to first.\n\n\"I can't really remember a time,\" Abreu said through a translator when asked if he was ever that fired up on a single. \"It felt really good to win that battle.\"\n\nGilbert thought he had him struck out and the fifth pitch that was called a ball.\n\n\"It's tough. It's not the first missed strike ever and it won't be the last, it's part of the game,\" Gilbert said. \"It just comes down to execution and finding a way out of it. That stuff's going to happen. ... It's a tough game already, it's tougher when you have four outs or an extra strike.\"\n\nYoshida then homered on a 94.6-mph fastball from Gilbert, sending it an estimated 425 feet over the Red Sox bullpen and making it 4-0.\n\n\"I think it really comes down to trying to be aggressive on the first pitch,\" Yoshida said through a translator.\n\nRafael Devers doubled, and Tyler O'Neill and Smith had consecutive RBI doubles before Seattle manager Scott Servais lifted Gilbert.\n\n\"We had two strikes on Abreu and couldn't get strike 3,'' Servais said. \"To his credit, he had a really good at-bat to finish it off.\"\n\nSmith homered into the first row of Green Monster seats near the left-field foul pole to make it 11-1 in the fifth.\n\nMAKING MOVES\n\nSeattle made its third significant move ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline, acquiring veteran Justin Turner from Toronto in exchange for minor league outfielder RJ Schreck.\n\nBoston acquired right-handed pitcher Quinn Priester from the Pittsburgh Pirates for minor league infielder/outfielder Nick Yorke in an exchange of former first-round draft picks, then optioned Priester (2-6, 5.04 ERA) to Triple-A Worcester.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMariners: C Raleigh was shaken up when he got hit by a foul tip, but he stayed in the game. ... Arozarena hit a side wall in left hard trying to make a catch and came out early, but Servais said he felt alright and would play Tuesday.\n\nRed Sox: 1B Triston Casas is scheduled to start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Worcester on Tuesday. He's been on the IL since mid-April due to a rib strain.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: RHP Luis Castillo (8-10, 3.38 ERA) is slated to start the second of the three-game series on Tuesday. He's 1-2 with a 5.06 ERA in three career starts against the Red Sox. Boston LHP James Paxton (8-2, 4.43) is slated to make his first start since being picked up in a trade with Los Angeles on Friday.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri":

Abreu had two RBIs for Boston, which had lost seven of nine games since the All-Star break.\n\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora said the key to the inning was Jarren Duran hustling to beat out a potential inning-ending, double-play grounder before Abreu's at-bat.\n\n\"That changed the game, then Abreu puts on that at-bat,\" Cora said. \"He beat him with the fastball his first at-bat. He went to the fastball a lot in that one, and Wily just stayed on him. ... That was an awesome at-bat.\"\n\nDominic Smith added a solo homer and two RBIs, Romy Gonzalez hit a pinch-hit two run shot and the Red Sox had a season-high eight doubles.\n\nNick Pivetta (5-7) struck out 10 and allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings.\n\nRandy Arozarena and Cal Raleigh hit solo homers for the Mariners, who had a three-game winning streak halted.\n\nSeattle's Logan Gilbert (6-7) was tagged for seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. The 27-year-old righty had held opponents to one or no earned runs in 11 of his previous 21 starts. Against Boston, his night unraveled quickly with two outs in the third inning.\n\nWith a runner on third and two outs after his wild pitch allowed Connor Wong to score the first run, Abreu had fallen into an 0-2 hole before battling back to a full count. He then fouled off five straight pitches before hitting a ground single to right that made it 2-0.\n\nAbreu yelled into the Red Sox dugout as he was running to first.\n\n\"I can't really remember a time,\" Abreu said through a translator when asked if he was ever that fired up on a single. \"It felt really good to win that battle.\"\n\nGilbert thought he had him struck out and the fifth pitch that was called a ball.\n\n\"It's tough. It's not the first missed strike ever and it won't be the last, it's part of the game,\" Gilbert said. \"It just comes down to execution and finding a way out of it. That stuff's going to happen. ... It's a tough game already, it's tougher when you have four outs or an extra strike.\"\n\nYoshida then homered on a 94.6-mph fastball from Gilbert, sending it an estimated 425 feet over the Red Sox bullpen and making it 4-0.\n\n\"I think it really comes down to trying to be aggressive on the first pitch,\" Yoshida said through a translator.\n\nRafael Devers doubled, and Tyler O'Neill and Smith had consecutive RBI doubles before Seattle manager Scott Servais lifted Gilbert.\n\n\"We had two strikes on Abreu and couldn't get strike 3,\" Servais said. \"To his credit, he had a really good at-bat to finish it off.\"\n\nSmith homered into the first row of Green Monster seats near the left-field foul pole to make it 11-1 in the fifth.\n\nMAKING MOVES\n\nSeattle made its third significant move ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline, acquiring veteran Justin Turner from Toronto in exchange for minor league outfielder RJ Schreck.\n\nBoston acquired right-handed pitcher Quinn Priester from the Pittsburgh Pirates for minor league infielder/outfielder Nick Yorke in an exchange of former first-round draft picks, then optioned Priester (2-6, 5.04 ERA) to Triple-A Worcester.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMariners: C Raleigh was shaken up when he got hit by a foul tip, but he stayed in the game. ... Arozarena hit a side wall in left hard trying to make a catch and came out early, but Servais said he felt alright and would play Tuesday.\n\nRed Sox: 1B Triston Casas is scheduled to start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Worcester on Tuesday. He's been on the IL since mid-April due to a rib strain.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: RHP Luis Castillo (8-10, 3.38 ERA) is slated to start the second of the three-game series on Tuesday. He's 1-2 with a 5.06 ERA in three career starts against the Red Sox. Boston LHP James Paxton (8-2, 4.43) is slated to make his first start since being picked up in a trade with Los Angeles on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "gorgenewscenter.com", "dataType": "news",

He'd thrown 26 pitches with 17 strikes.\n\nThe third inning started off with Connor Wong singling to right field on a 2-2 curveball. Gilbert came back to strike out David Hamilton looking for the first out. Even after No. 9 hitter Ceddanne Rafaela singled to left, it looked like the Mariners would get out of the inning scoreless when Duran hit a comebacker to the mound.\n\nGilbert gloved the ball and fired to second base to start the double play, making sure the lead throw was true. But that slight pause to be precise allowed the ultra-speedy Duran to barely beat Dylan Moore's throw to first.\n\nIn 486 plate appearances this season - the most in MLB - Duran has only grounded into two double plays.\n\nWith runners on first and third, Gilbert still only had to retire Wilyer Abreu to end the building drama. He'd already struck out Abreu swinging in the first inning, firing nothing but fastballs.\n\nGilbert got up 0-2 on Abreu with back-to-back split-finger fastballs. A third straight splitter was fouled off. Looking for the strike out, Gilbert fired a 98-mph fastball that ran inside on the left-handed hitting Abreu. He went back to the heater again, placing a 97-mph fastball at the lower-outside quadrant of the strike zone. Gilbert thought it was a strike. Catcher Cal Raleigh held the pitch that he didn't really need to frame too much to show it was a strike. Even Abreu seemed to back off thinking he'd watched strike three.\n\nBut Fletcher called it a ball.\n\nAbreu's at-bat continued despite the protests from the Mariners' dugout.\n\nEverything for Gilbert and Seattle imploded from that moment.\n\nGilbert fired a split-finger in the dirt that Raleigh couldn't block for a wild pitch that allowed Wong to score the first run of the game.\n\nWith the count full, Abreu wouldn't give in. He fouled off five consecutive pitches and then smacked the 12th pitch of the at-bat - a 96-mph fastball - into right field to score Duran.\n\nInstead of finding a way to limit the damage, Gilbert, who has been the Mariners' best starting pitcher this season, couldn't finish the inning.\n\nThe next batter, Masataka Yoshida, ambushed a first-pitch fastball, sending it into the Red Sox bullpen for a two-run homer and a 4-0 lead.\n\n- Tyler O'Neill doubled down the third-base line to score Devers\n\n- Domonic Smith doubled off the Green Monster in left to score O'Neill to make it 6-0.\n\nWith Gilbert having thrown 43 pitches in the inning, manager Scott Servais had to pull his starter despite being short-handed in the bullpen.\n\nGilbert's departure didn't stop the run-scoring fiesta. Trent Thornton gave up a double to Wong that scored another run, which was charged to Gilbert. The inning mercifully came to an end when Wong was thrown out trying to steal third.\n\nBoston scored seven runs in the third inning on six consecutive two-out hits.\n\nGilbert's final line: 2 2/3 innings pitched, seven earned runs on seven hits with no walks and four strikeouts.\n\nA promising start turned into Gilbert's worst outing of the season. It was the first time he hadn't pitched into the sixth inning of an outing since May 9 at Target Field when he lasted just four innings against the Twins, allowing eight runs on nine hits.\n\nIn his first 20 starts before the All-Star break, Gilbert posted a 6-5 record with 2.79 ERA. In his two outings, after the break, he's taken the loss, allowing 12 runs (eight earned) in 10 1/3 innings pitched.\n\nDown 7-0 after three innings, the only drama in the game would be how many runs would the Mariners allow and what position player would pitch in the rout to save the bullpen.\n\nThe Mariners picked up their first run in the top of the fourth when Randy Arozarena doubled off Red Sox starter Nick Pivetta and later scored on Jorge Polanco's sac fly.\n\nThornton, who tried to pitch beyond normal usage, gave up three runs in the fourth inning and two more in the fifth before being lifted with two outs and Seattle trailing 12-1. He threw 42 pitches, which was a season high.\n\nArozarena hit his first homer as a Mariner in the fifth inning, sending a towering fly ball over the foul pole in left field off Pivetta. Raleigh followed with his 23rd homer of the season, smashing a ball into the right-field seats.\n\nBut the Red Sox got those two runs right back when Romy Gonzalez hit a two-run homer off Gabe Speier in the bottom of the inning.\n\nSeattle scored four runs in the eighth inning, but that only made the score seem a little less lopsided.", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news",

Boston teed off against Seattle's starting pitcher Logan Gilbert, charging the right-hander with seven runs off eight hits -- the most recorded by the Red Sox in a single inning since April 17 versus the Chicago Cubs -- including five for extra bases. Gilbert, who only managed to record two outs in the inning, walked off the mound with a 69-pitch count before Mariners skipper Scott Servais had seen enough.\n\nHowever... the run-pouring punishment didn't just end with Gilbert. In fact, it was just the start of Seattle's long night.\n\nThe Red Sox scored a combined seven more runs throughout the following three innings, crushing a total of three home runs alongside eight doubles. Masataka Yoshida finished as the game's leader in RBIs (four). The 31-year-old designated hitter entered the night hitting .318 with 21 hits and 16 RBIs -- Yoshida's highest of any month this season -- in 66 at-bats in July. Needless to say, the offense going berserk made setting down the Mariners' offense infinitely easier for Boston's recently struggling pitching staff.\n\nSeattle was out-hit, 16-10, by Boston once the dust settled.\n\nOvershadowed by the master class performance on display in the batter's box was the continuation of Red Sox relief pitching struggles. Trey Wingenter entered the game in the sixth inning for Boston and turned Seattle's 11-run deficit into a seven-run run deficit. Chief baseball officer Craig Breslow and the rest of the organization's front office still have time -- albeit less than 24 hours -- to consider whether or not to ride with the team's pitching staff as is or acquire some more depth before Tuesday's trade deadline.\n\nSTARS OF THE GAME\n\n-- Yoshida finished an elite showing at the plate going 3-for-5 with his fifth home run and ninth double of the season.\n\n-- Red Sox right-hander Nick Pivetta set the tone on the mound with a quality start. The 31-year-old pitched 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs to the Mariners of six hits while striking out 10 batters. Seattle went 0-for-3 with runners in scoring position when facing Pivetta, allowing the eight-year veteran to improve his ERA to 4.47.\n\n-- Mariners trade deadline addition Randy Arozarena recorded his first home run with Seattle by taking Pivetta deep in the sixth inning. The long ball marked the 29-year-old's 16th of the season.\n\nON DECK AT NESN\n\nThe Red Sox and Mariners will continue their three-game set on Tuesday night at Fenway Park. First pitch is scheduled for 7:10 P.M. ET -- over an hour following the MLB trade deadline -- and you can watch the game, plus pregame coverage, live on NESN.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors":

Red Sox Prediction, Odds, Pick - 7/29/2024", "body": "Last Start: Gilbert went 6 2/3 innings in his last outing, allowing five runs, one earned, four hits, striking out eight, and walking one in a loss to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\n2024 Road Splits: Gilbert has done well on the road, going 4-2 with a 2.57 ERA over 11 starts away from Seattle.\n\nNick Pivetta (4-7) with a 4.50 ERA\n\nLast Start: Pivetta was awful in his last start, going just 2 2/3 innings, allowing eight runs, seven earned, 10 hits, and striking out seven in a loss to the Colorado Rockies.\n\n2024 Home Splits: Pivetta has struggled at Fenway, going 1-4 with a 5.50 ERA over seven starts at home.\n\nThe Mariners were struggling until this past weekend when they enjoyed a three-game sweep over the Chicago White Sox. Now, they must continue the momentum against a significantly better team, one they may face in the wildcard round. Their offense has struggled due to injuries to key players like Julio Rodriguez. Because of this, they have fallen from leaders in the American League West to completely out of the playoff race, trailing the final wildcard spot by 1 1/2 games.\n\nThe offense does not have much going for them other than Rodriguez. But they do have Cal Raleigh. Significantly, he currently leads the team in home runs with 21. Things are going well for him when he makes contact. However, he has struggled to make contact often. So when he does not, the rest of the offense tends to suffer. The Mariners need him to be the leader while Rodriguez recovers.\n\nGilbert has reached the seventh inning in three straight starts. Ultimately, he has gone 0-0 with a 3.12 ERA over four starts against the Sox in his career. When Gilbert completes this start, he will turn it over to a bullpen that is seventh in baseball in team ERA. Andres Munoz is the closer for now, but the Mariners added Yimi Garcia in a trade to strengthen their bullpen.\n\nThe Mariners will cover the spread if Raleigh and the offense can string some hits together. Then, they need Gilbert to dominate and avoid making mistakes against the top hitters in the lineup.\n\nWhy The Red Sox Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Red Sox are doing significantly better than last season. Yet, they are still on the outside looking in as they attempt to string some wins together. They need their offense to continue hitting the baseball and driving runs home.\n\nJarren Duran is one of the better hitters in the lineup. However, he is batting only .256 with 10 hits, two home runs, five RBIs, and six runs over 10 games against the M's. Rafael Devers is a monster at the plate and has also done well against the Mariners. Ultimately, he is hitting .331 with 51 hits, 10 home runs, 29 RBIs, and 32 runs. Tyler O'Neil is another good hitter who can make contact. Additionally, he is batting .300 with nine hits, two home runs, three RBIs, and six runs over nine games against Seattle.\n\nBefore his poor start, Pivetta had hurled three straight quality starts. Therefore, there is reason to believe he will bounce back in this start, especially against a team he has done rarely well against. Pivetta is 1-2 with a 3.65 ERA over four games against the M's. When he finishes his start, he will turn it over to a bullpen that is 16th in team ERA. Kenley Jensen is the man who shuts the door down for the Sox and is 3-1 with a 3.13 ERA and 20 saves in 23 chances.\n\nThe Red Sox will cover the spread if their lineup continues to play well. Then, they need Pivetta to bounce back.\n\nFinal Mariners-Red Sox Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Mariners have been in freefall for a long time, and things seem to be trending downward. Likewise, it is tough to trust them on the road. The Red Sox have covered the spread in all four games against Seattle this season. We also do like Pivetta to bounce back as he has been dominant. Gilbert is one of the best pitchers in the game. Unfortunately, he has had almost no run support this season. We expect that to continue.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Rodr\u00edguez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julio Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Raleigh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cal Raleigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yimi_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yimi Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Mariners-vs.-Red-Sox-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773732", "eventUri": "eng-9773732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

On Monday night at Fenway, the Red Sox benefitted greatly from one.\n\nMariners starter Logan Gilbert didn't get a strike-three call on a 1-2 count to Wilyer Abreu with two outs in the third and the floodgates opened for one of Boston's best innings of the year. The Red Sox laced five extra-base hits and scored seven runs in the frame -- all with two outs -- and went on to beat the Mariners, 14-7, in the opener of a key series between two wild card contenders.\n\nThe Red Sox combined for 16 hits with Jarren Duran, Abreu, Masataka Yoshida, Dom Smith and Connor Wong all posting multi-hit affairs. Yoshida led the way, going 3-for-5 with four RBIs; he fell a triple short of the cycle as the Red Sox improved to 56-49.\n\nLike Red Sox starter Nick Pivetta, Gilbert was perfect through his first two innings. The third was a different story altogether. Wong led off with a single, then after Ceddanne Rafaela got a hit of his own, the Sox had runners on second and third with two outs. With a 1-2 count on Abreu, Gilbert unleashed a 97.8 mph fastball that caught much of the bottom of the zone. Home plate umpire Andy Fletcher didn't think so. From there, it was all Red Sox.\n\nThe next Gilbert offering was a wild pitch that plated Wong for the game's opening run. Abreu then worked a 12-pitch at-bat before lacing an RBI single to make it 2-0. The dam then opened wide. Yoshida's fifth homer of the season made it 4-0. Rafael Devers, Tyler O'Neill and Smith had back-to-back-to-back doubles to make it 6-0. And after Trent Thornton replaced Gilbert, Wong made it 7-0 with Boston's fourth consecutive double -- and the Sox' eighth hit of the inning, tying a season-high.\n\nGilbert, an All-Star, watched his ERA balloon from 2.72 to 3.11 in his shortest start of the season (and just the second time in 22 starts he has not pitched into the sixth. Pivetta, on the other hand, cruised for most of the game before a couple late homers skewed his line. He went 6 \u2154 innings and was tagged with three runs on six hits while striking out 10.\n\nThe first Seattle run came in the top of the fourth when Randy Arozarena hit a leadoff double and scored on a Jorge Polanco sac fly. The Sox' offense answered that with three more runs off Thornton in the bottom of the fourth as Abreu (RBI double) and Yoshida (two-run single) stayed hot.\n\nSmith made it a double-digit lead with a solo homer in the fifth, his sixth of the season. After a Polanco throwing error extended the inning, Jarren Duran made it 12-1 with an RBI double, his second two-bagger in as many innings. In the sixth, Arozarena and Cal Raleigh went back-to-back with homers down the right field line and it became 12-3. The Red Sox once again expanded their lead when Romy Gonzalez hit a pinch-hit two-run homer off lefty Gabe Speier.\n\nTrey Wingenter's return to the majors didn't go well after he replaced Pivetta. The Mariners tagged him for three runs and four hits in the eighth inning as the righty's ERA rose to 27.00 in two major league outings this year.\n\nPaxton to make Sox season debut on deadline day\n\nWhile the big story of Tuesday will be the 6 p.m. ET trade deadline, the Red Sox also have a game to play. It'll prominently feature one of their early trade acquisitions as left-hander James Paxton (8-2, 4.43 ERA with the Dodgers) will make his first start in a Red Sox uniform this season after being acquired from Los Angeles last week. The Mariners will send tough righty Luis Castillo (8-10, 3.38 ERA) to the mound.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The guys are really starting to come together,\" said Mariners manager Scott Servais, whose club has won four of five and avenged a 14-7 rout by Boston on Monday night.\n\nThe Mariners have scored six or more runs in each of their last five games, outscoring opponents 39-26 during that stretch.\n\nSeattle starter Luis Castillo (9-10) pitched six innings, holding Boston to three runs on six hits and a walk. He struck out three.\n\n\"Yesterday I felt like we were punched a lot. But tonight, most of the guys came in with the mentality 'It's not going to stay like that,'\" Castillo said through a translator.\n\nRafael Devers hit a three-run homer for Boston in the third. The Red Sox added three more runs in the seventh, but could not complete a comeback from a 10-3 deficit.\n\nThe Red Sox made three errors, including two in the fifth, when the Mariners chased starter James Paxton (8-3), and another in the sixth. Paxton, picked up by Boston in a trade last week with the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitched 4 1/3 innings, allowing six runs on six hits and striking out five.\n\n\"Obviously we didn't play defense behind him,\" Boston manager Alex Cora said.\n\nThe Mariners had 11 at-bats in the fifth. A throwing error by first baseman Dominic Smith followed by a fielder's choice loaded the bases for Seattle. Shortstop Ceddanne Rafaela pulled Smith off the bag and allowed Randy Arozarena to reach on a fielder's choice -- after a successful challenge by the Mariners overturned the original call.\n\nJustin Turner drove in a run with a fielder's choice, Polanco drew a walk and then Moore hit a double off reliever Zack Kelly off of the Green Monster to clear the bases for three more runs.\n\n\"We've had two consistent nights of offense, which is great,\" said Moore, who went 2 for 3 and reached base four times.\n\nReliever Yohan Ram\u00edrez allowed a run to score on a wild pitch in the sixth, then Ram\u00edrez hit Mitch Garver. Garver stole second and when Boston catcher Connor Wong's throw bounced into center field Polanco scored.\n\nTurner made his debut for the Mariners one day after Seattle acquired him in a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays. Turner, who spent last season with the Red Sox, drove in a pair of runs and Arozarena, who just joined Seattle over the weekend after a trade with Tampa Bay, also drove in a run.\n\n\"This ballpark, as hitter friendly as it is, you're going to outscore them certain nights and that's what we did,\" Servais said. \"A lot of good things offensively. It's been a really good road trip for us offensively, so credit to our guys. We're starting to get some rhythm going there.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM'\n\nMariners: CF Victor Robles left the game in the eighth with what Servais described as a \"hip issue\" that will keep him out of the lineup Wednesday. \"It's hard to take him out, but we've got to do what's best for him,\" Servais said.\n\nRed Sox: SS Ceddanne Rafaela spent a few minutes with trainers after getting hit by a pitch in the bottom of the fifth. He remained in the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP George Kirby (8-7, 5.37 ERA) tries to help the Mariners clinch the series with a start Wednesday night against RHP Brayan Bello (10-5, 5.27) for the Red

Abreu had two RBIs for Boston, which had lost seven of nine games since the All-Star break.\n\nDominic Smith added a solo homer and two RBIs, Romy Gonzalez hit a pinch-hit two run shot and the Red Sox had a season-high eight doubles.\n\nNick Pivetta (5-7) struck out 10 and allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings.\n\nRandy Arozarena and Cal Raleigh hit solo homers for the Mariners, who had a three-game winning streak halted.\n\nSeattle's Logan Gilbert (6-7) was tagged for seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. The 27-year-old righty had held opponents to one or no earned runs in 11 of his previous 21 starts. Against Boston, his night unraveled quickly with two outs in the third inning.\n\nWith a runner on third and two outs after his wild pitch allowed Connor Wong to score the first run, Abreu fell into an 0-2 hole before battling back to a full count. He then fouled off five straight pitches before hitting a ground single to right that made it 2-0.\n\nAbreu yelled into the Red Sox dugout as he was running to first.\n\nYoshida then homered on a 94.6-mph fastball from Gilbert, sending it an estimated 425 feet over the Red Sox bullpen and making it 4-0.\n\nRafael Devers doubled, and Tyler O'Neill and Smith had consecutive RBI doubles before Seattle manager Scott Servais lifted Gilbert.\n\nSmith homered into the first row of Green Monster seats near the left-field foul pole to make it 11-1 in the fifth.\n\nMAKING MOVES\n\nSeattle made its third significant move ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline, acquiring veteran Justin Turner from Toronto in exchange for minor league outfielder RJ Schreck.\n\nBoston acquired right-handed pitcher Quinn Priester from the Pittsburgh Pirates for minor league infielder/outfielder Nick Yorke in an exchange of former first-round draft picks, then optioned Priester (2-6, 5.04 ERA) to Triple-A Worcester.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMariners: C Raleigh was shaken up when he got hit by a foul tip, but he stayed in the game.\n\nRed Sox: 1B Triston Casas is scheduled to start a rehab assignment with Triple-A Worcester on Tuesday. He's been on the IL since mid-April due to a rib strain.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: RHP Luis Castillo (8-10, 3.38 ERA) is slated to start the second of the three-game series on Tuesday. He's 1-2 with a 5.06 ERA in three career starts against the Red Sox.

He'd thrown 26 pitches with 17 strikes.\n\nThe third inning started off with Connor Wong singling to right field on a 2-2 curveball. Gilbert came back to strike out David Hamilton looking for the first out. Even after No. 9 hitter Ceddanne Rafaela singled to left, it looked like the Mariners would get out of the inning scoreless when Duran hit a comebacker to the mound.\n\nGilbert gloved the ball and fired to second base to start the double play, making sure the lead throw was true. But that slight pause to be precise allowed the ultra-speedy Duran to barely beat Dylan Moore's throw to first.\n\nIn 486 plate appearances this season -- the most in MLB -- Duran has only grounded into two double plays.\n\nWith runners on first and third, Gilbert still only had to retire Wilyer Abreu to end the building drama. He'd already struck out Abreu swinging in the first inning, firing nothing but fastballs.\n\nGilbert got up 0-2 on Abreu with back-to-back split-finger fastballs. A third straight splitter was fouled off. Looking for the strike out, Gilbert fired a 98-mph fastball that ran inside on the left-handed hitting Abreu. He went back to the heater again, placing a 97-mph fastball at the lower-outside quadrant of the strike zone. Gilbert thought it was a strike. Catcher Cal Raleigh held the pitch that he didn't really need to frame too much to show it was a strike. Even Abreu seemed to back off thinking he'd watched strike three.\n\nBut Fletcher called it a ball.\n\nAbreu's at-bat continued despite the protests from the Mariners' dugout.\n\nEverything for Gilbert and Seattle imploded from that moment.\n\nGilbert fired a split-finger in the dirt that Raleigh couldn't block for a wild pitch that allowed Wong to score the first run of the game.\n\nWith the count full, Abreu wouldn't give in. He fouled off five consecutive pitches and then smacked the 12th pitch of the at-bat -- a 96-mph fastball -- into right field to score Duran.\n\nInstead of finding a way to limit the damage, Gilbert, who has been the Mariners' best starting pitcher this season, couldn't finish the inning.\n\nThe next batter, Masataka Yoshida, ambushed a first-pitch fastball, sending it into the Red Sox bullpen for a two-run homer and a 4-0 lead.\n\nThe carnage continued:\n\n-- Rafael Devers doubled to left field\n\n-- Tyler O'Neill doubled down the third-base line to score Devers\n\n-- Domonic Smith doubled off the Green Monster in left to score O'Neill to make it 6-0.\n\nWith Gilbert having thrown 43 pitches in the inning, manager Scott Servais had to pull his starter despite being short-handed in the bullpen.\n\nGilbert's departure didn't stop the run-scoring fiesta. Trent Thornton gave up a double to Wong that scored another run, which was charged to Gilbert. The inning mercifully came to an end when Wong was thrown out trying to steal third.\n\nBoston scored seven runs in the third inning on six consecutive two-out hits.\n\nGilbert's final line: 2 2/3 innings pitched, seven earned runs on seven hits with no walks and four strikeouts.\n\nA promising start turned into Gilbert's worst outing of the season. It was the first time he hadn't pitched into the sixth inning of an outing since May 9 at Target Field when he lasted just four innings against the Twins, allowing eight runs on nine hits.\n\nIn his first 20 starts before the All-Star break, Gilbert posted a 6-5 record with 2.79 ERA. In his two outings, after the break, he's taken the loss, allowing 12 runs (eight earned) in 10 1/3 innings pitched.\n\nDown 7-0 after three innings, the only drama in the game would be how many runs would the Mariners allow and what position player would pitch in the rout to save the bullpen.\n\nThe Mariners picked up their first run in the top of the fourth when Randy Arozarena doubled off Red Sox starter Nick Pivetta and later scored on Jorge Polanco's sac fly.\n\nThornton, who tried to pitch beyond normal usage, gave up three runs in the fourth inning and two more in the fifth before being lifted with two outs and Seattle trailing 12-1. He threw 42 pitches, which was a season high.\n\nArozarena hit his first homer as a Mariner in the fifth inning, sending a towering fly ball over the foul pole in left field off Pivetta. Raleigh followed with his 23rd homer of the season, smashing a ball into the right-field seats.\n\nBut the Red Sox got those two runs right back when Romy Gonzalez hit a two-run homer off Gabe Speier in the bottom of the inning.\n\nSeattle scored four runs in the eighth inning, but that only made the score seem a little less lopsided.\n\n\u00a92024 The Seattle Times.

The Mariners ace had gone at least 6 \u2154 innings in each of his last three starts, and had allowed one earned run over his previous 13 \u2154 innings. But in Monday night's series opener, he didn't make it out of the third. Gilbert threw two perfect innings, and then, the Red Sox attacked, scoring seven runs, all with two outs.\n\nIt all started with Jarren Duran. Most runners would've found themselves in an inning-ending double play. Boston's \"angry lizard\" leadoff man was safe on first, and the inning would only get better from there.\n\n\"The hustle play by Jarren, that changed the game,\" Alex Cora said.\n\nAs Wilyer Abreu stood at the plate battling Gilbert, Duran stole his 23rd base. A wild pitch brought Wong home to score the first run and advance Duran to third. On the 12th pitch, Abreu singled, easily scoring Duran.\n\n\"Willy just stayed on him,\" Cora said of Abreu. \"Before the game Raffy (Devers) was talking about the approach, you know, because if you don't stay with the fastball to left-center, this one is going to play, you're going to chase, and I think the guys did an outstanding job using the big part of the field, and that was an awesome at-bat.\"\n\nAs soon as Abreu's lengthy battle reached its triumphant conclusion, Masataka Yoshida sent the first pitch he saw 425 feet to center.\n\nThen, it was double time. Rafael Devers, Tyler O'Neill, and Dom Smith each landed on second. O'Neill and Smith drove in a run apiece, with Smith also knocking the Mariners starter out of the game.\n\nThe pitching change came little, too late. Wong - batting for the second time in the inning - greeted Mariners reliever Trent Thornton with the fourth consecutive double, scoring Smith for the seventh and final run.\n\nAll in all, the Red Sox sent 11 men to the plate, collected eight hits - tying their season-high for a single inning, and plated seven runs, the most in a frame since July 19, 2021 in Toronto. Gilbert threw 69 pitches (47 for strikes) and was charged with seven earned runs on eight hits, including a home run, zero walks, four strikeouts, and a wild pitch.\n\nThe Red Sox put up another three in the fourth, and two apiece in the fifth and six. Yoshida led the way, going 3-for-5 with two runs, a double, the homer, and four RBI. Duran, Abreu, and Smith contributed two knocks apiece. Romy Gonzalez pinch-hit for Devers, and homered on the first pitch he saw.\n\nIt also helped that the Red Sox received a deep start from Nick Pivetta. The right-hander gave Boston 6 \u2154 innings, and held the Mariners to three earned runs on six hits, including back-to-back solo homers by Randy Arozarena and Cal Raleigh, one walk, and struck out 10.\n\n\"Nick gave us enough,\" Cora said. \"For the next few games (the bullpen) should be okay.\"\n\nThe Red Sox would be grateful for such a wide margin for error in the eighth. Trey Wingenter opened the frame with a strikeout and then loaded the bases on a pair of one-out singles and a walk. Four runs scored before Wingenter, recalled from Triple-A hours earlier in exchange for Greg Weissert, was able to get out of the inning. Bailey Horn pitched a scoreless ninth, and it was game over.

He'd thrown 26 pitches with 17 strikes.\n\nThe third inning started off with Connor Wong singling to right field on a 2-2 curveball. Gilbert came back to strike out David Hamilton looking for the first out. Even after No. 9 hitter Ceddanne Rafaela singled to left, it looked like the Mariners would get out of the inning scoreless when Duran hit a comebacker to the mound.\n\nGilbert gloved the ball and turned to fire to second base to start the double play, making sure the lead throw was true. But that momentary pause to be precise with his throw allowed the ultra-speedy Duran to barely beat Dylan Moore's throw to first.\n\n\"He flies and gets out of the box good,\" Servais said. \"Logan did what he could do. He threw a bullet to second. We turned it good. He just beat it out.\"\n\nIn 486 plate appearances this season -- the most in MLB -- Duran has only grounded into two double plays.\n\n\"I thought we would turn it,\" Gilbert said. \"That's a play that definitely changed the inning. He's a great player all the way around with he can do at the plate and then obviously his speed. With a lot of other players,that's probably a double play there.\"\n\nWith runners on first and third, Gilbert still only had to retire Wilyer Abreu to end the building drama. He'd already struck out Abreu swinging in the first inning, firing nothing but fastballs.\n\nGilbert got up 0-2 on Abreu with back-to-back split-finger fastballs. A third straight splitter was fouled off. Looking for the strike out, Gilbert fired a 98-mph fastball that ran inside on the left-handed hitting Abreu. He went back to the heater again, placing a 97-mph fastball at the lower-outside quadrant of the strike zone. Gilbert thought it was strike. Catcher Cal Raleigh held the pitch that he didn't really need to frame too much to show it was a strike. Even Abreu seemed to back off thinking he'd watched strike three.\n\nBut Fletcher called it a ball.\n\n\"It's tough,\" GIlbert said. \"It's not the first missed strike ever and won't be the last for sure. It's a part of the game. That stuff's gonna happen. But it's a tough game already. It's tougher when you have to get four outs or an extra strike or whatever it may be, especially against a good team like that. No hard feelings. That's how it is.\"\n\nAbreu's at-bat continued despite the protests from the Mariners' dugout.\n\n\"I thought we had him struck out,\" Servais said. \"We should have had strike three and didn't get the call.\"\n\nEverything for Gilbert and Seattle imploded from that moment.\n\nGilbert fired a split-finger in the dirt that Raleigh couldn't block for a wild pitch that allowed Wong to score the first run of the game.\n\nWith the count full, Abreu wouldn't give in. He fouled off five consecutive pitches and then smacked the 12th pitch of the at-bat -- a 96-mph fastball -- into right field to score Duran.\n\n\"He had really good at-bat there, especially after that pitch,\" Gilbert said. \"I would have loved to get out of there with zero runs. It definitely changes the game if I get that call, but he had a great at-bat and fouled off a lot of pitches.\"\n\nInstead of finding a way to limit the damage, Gilbert, who has been the Mariners' best starting pitcher this season, couldn't finish the inning.\n\nThe next batter, Masataka Yoshida, ambushed a first-pitch fastball, sending it into the Red Sox bullpen for a two-run homer and a 4-0 lead.\n\nThe carnage continued:\n\nRafael Devers doubled to left field\n\nTyler O'Neill doubled down the third-base line to score Devers\n\nDomonic Smith doubled off the Green Monster in left to score O'Neill to make it 6-0.\n\nWith Gilbert having thrown 43 pitches in the inning, Servais had to pull his starter despite being short-handed in the bullpen.\n\n\"I've got to do a better job of executing,\" Gilbert said. \"Even if things or calls don't go your way, I have to find a way out of it.\"\n\nGilbert's departure didn't stop the run-scoring fiesta. Trent Thornton gave up a double to Wong that scored another run, which was charged to Gilbert. The inning mercifully came to an end when Wong was thrown out trying to steal third.\n\nBoston scored seven runs in the third inning on six consecutive two-out hits.\n\n\"I thought we had him struck out,\" Servais said. \"It didn't happen. He ended up having a really deep at-bat, got a huge hit. And then they got the momentum. The snowball got rolling down the hill, and we couldn't stop it. You don't often see that happen with our pitching staff. We usually pretty good at controlling those type of innings.\"\n\nGilbert's final line: 2 2/3 innings pitched, seven earned runs on seven hits with no walks and four strikeouts.\n\nA promising start turned into Gilbert's worst outing of the season. It was the first time he hadn't pitched into the sixth inning of an outing since May 9 at Target Field when he lasted just four innings against the Twins, allowing eight runs on nine hits.\n\nIn his first 20 starts before the All-Star break, Gilbert posted a 6-5 record with 2.79 ERA. In his two outings, after the break, he's taken the loss, allowing 12 runs (eight earned) in 10 1/3 innings pitched.\n\n\"He's really good and I'm glad we got him,\" Servais said. \"He's very consistent. He goes out there and gives you great effort. It wasn't because of a lack of effort. They put some balls in play, they squared him up and as the inning went on, the pitch count grew and he wasn't quite as sharp.\"\n\nDown 7-0 after three innings, the only drama in the game would be how many runs would the Mariners allow and what position player would pitch in the rout to save the bullpen. They never did have to use Josh Rojas or any other position player to pitch in the game.\n\nThe Mariners picked up their first run in the top of the fourth when Randy Arozarena doubled off Red Sox starter Nick Pivetta and later scored on Jorge Polanco's sac fly.\n\nThornton, who tried to pitch beyond normal usage, gave up three runs in the fourth inning and two more in the fifth before being lifted with two outs and Seattle trailing 12-1. He threw 42 pitches, which was a season high.\n\nArozarena hit his first homer as a Mariner in the fifth inning, sending a towering fly ball over the foul pole in left field off Pivetta. Raleigh followed with his 23rd homer of the season, smashing a ball into the right-field seats.\n\nBut the Red Sox got those two runs right back when Romy Gonzalez hit a two-run homer off Gabe Speier in the bottom of the inning.\n\nSeattle scored four runs in the eighth inning, but that only made the score seem a little less lopsided.\n\nArozarena was removed from the game for a pinch hitter in the eighth inning out of precaution. He collided with the wall in the small foul territory in left field trying to make a play, banging his right shoulder against it.\n\n\"He's okay, but that's why we took him out,\" Servais said. \"It's a little concerning there. He says he's good to go for tomorrow, so you'll see him in the lineup.\"", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Walking into a perfect window of opportunity to capitalize, the Red Sox dropped two of three, allowing a chance to cut into the American League East standings blow with the wind, which made Monday's series opener all that more crucial.\n\n\"We kind of needed it to be honest,\" Cora said after Boston's 14-7 victory.\n\nBoston began its runaway rally early, charging Mariners starter Logan Gilbert with seven runs in the third inning. The Red Sox recorded eight hits, which was their most in an inning since April 27 against the Chicago Cubs -- including five for extra bases -- which knocked out Seattle's right-hander after 2 2/3 innings of work. From there, seven more runs were added over the course of the following three innings, giving Boston's pitching staff a (very) handy 14-3 advantage heading into the seventh inning. It even allowed Cora, too, to relax a bit from the team's dugout.\n\n\"I was able to breathe,\" Cora explained. \"You see the first inning, what (Gilbert) was doing and you're like, 'Oh, here we go again.' Then Connor (Wong) goes the other way, (Ceddanne) Rafaela gets a hit on a breaking ball, Jarren (Duran) hustles, and then the at-bat was a big one, but the big swing by Masa (Yoshida) -- he's been swinging extremely well.\"\n\nCora added: \"Every pitch felt like it meant a lot, probably bigger than what it really is. It was intense and to be able to breathe a little bit today was good for us.\"\n\nMasataka Yoshida, who recorded his fourth three-plus hit performance of the season by going 3-for-5 at the plate, doubled Boston's 2-0 lead in the third inning with a two-run home run off Gilbert. Then the 31-year-old continued inflicting damage to Seattle in the fourth inning with a two-RBI single -- finishing the night responsible for driving in a game-leading four runs for the Red Sox.\n\n\"Obviously every day I need to be better. Try to be a better version of myself each and every day,\" Yoshida said, as translated in Japanese. \"That mindset has been helping me.\"\n\nCora emphasized that it's now time for Boston to turn the page. The team will welcome in newcomers James Paxton (who's starting next), Danny Jansen and Quinn Priester -- along with anyone else the front office acquires before the 6 p.m. ET trade deadline on Tuesday. The Red Sox remain 6 1/2 games back of the division-leading Baltimore Orioles and one game behind the Kansas City Royals for the final AL wild-card spot, amplifying the importance of every series moving forward.\n\nHere are more notes from Monday night's Red Sox-Mariners game:\n\n-- Yoshida tore into Seattle's pitching staff, and that's exactly what the two-year big leaguer has been doing lately. Boston's designated hitter has batted .345 with a .926 OPS, going 30-for-87 (with three home runs and 21 RBIs) in the last 24 games played.\n\n\"It was great to see him come out and do the exact same thing, and go out and give a competitive at-bat and have success after that,\" Boston starter Nick Pivetta said. \"It just kind of fuels the fire and just keeps us going as a group and Masa's an extraordinary player.\"\n\n-- Pivetta contributed with a quality start on the mound as the right-hander delivered 6 2/3 innings while surrendering three runs to the Mariners and tallied 10 strikeouts, which tied a season-high for the 31-year-old.\n\n\"I think that we come out with a fresh mind every single night with the capability to win every single game,\" Pivetta explained. \"The belief is around the clubhouse at all times with the guys that we have and we go out and we do the things that we can to win a baseball game.\"\n\n-- By finishing the night with 11 extra-base hits totaled, the Red Sox tied their season-high mark, the team's most since Friday night against the Yankees (also 11).\n\n-- Boston's offense has recorded 10-plus hits in a game for the 43rd time this season, which ranks second among AL teams behind the Houston Astros (46).\n\n-- The Red Sox and Mariners will continue their three-game series on Tuesday night at Fenway Park.

He struck out three.\n\nRafael Devers hit a three-run homer for Boston in the third. The Red Sox added three more runs in the seventh, but could not complete a comeback from the 10-3 deficit.\n\nThe Red Sox made three errors, including two in the fifth, when the Mariners chased starter James Paxton (8-3), and another in the sixth. Paxton, picked up by Boston in a trade last week with the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitched 4 1/3 innings, allowing six runs on six hits and struck out five.\n\nThe Mariners had 11 at-bats in the fifth. A throwing error by first baseman Dominic Smith followed by a fielder's choice loaded the bases for Seattle. Shortstop Ceddanne Rafaela pulled Smith off the bag and allowed Randy Arozarena to reach on a fielder's choice -- after a successful challenge by the Mariners overturned the original call.\n\nJustin Turner drove in a run with a fielder's choice, Polanco drew a walk and then Moore hit a double off reliever Zack Kelly off of the Green Monster to clear the bases for three more runs.\n\nReliever Yohan Ram\u00edrez allowed a run to score on a wild pitch in the sixth, then Ram\u00edrez hit Mitch Garver. Garver stole second and when Boston catcher Connor Wong's throw bounced into center field Polanco scored.\n\nTurner made his debut for the Mariners one day after Seattle acquired him in a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays. Turner, who spent last season with the Red Sox, drove in a pair of runs and Arozarena, who just joined Seattle over the weekend after a trade with Tampa Bay, also drove in a run.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM'\n\nRed Sox: SS Ceddanne Rafaela spent a few minutes with trainers after getting hit by a pitch in the bottom of the fifth.

Charles Krupa/Associated Press\n\nBOSTON -- Monday's series opener saw the Red Sox put together one of their best offensive innings of the season to flip a game on its head. Tuesday brought just about the polar opposite.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWHO: Seattle Mariners (Kirby 8-7) at Boston Red Sox (Bello 10-5)\n\nWHEN: 4:10 p.m. Wednesday\n\nTELEVISION: NESN\n\nPutrid infield defense from the Red Sox opened the door wide open for the Mariners to score five runs in a brutal fifth inning and Seattle went on to win, relatively easily, 10-6, hours after the MLB trade deadline passed.\n\nThree Red Sox errors helped James Paxton take a loss in his return to the Red Sox rotation as Boston, which has gone 3-8 since the All-Star break, fell to 56-50.\n\nThe Red Sox are in jeopardy of losing their fourth consecutive series with a defeat in Wednesday's rubber game.\n\nThe Red Sox took a 3-2 lead into the fifth inning but quickly gave it away behind a laboring Paxton. After Mitch Haniger opened the inning with a single, Dom Smith spiked a throw to Paxton covering first on a Leo Rivas bunt attempt and was charged with an error.\n\nNext up was a miscue by Rafael Devers, who fielded a Victor Robles ground ball and instead of trying to throw to second or first, tried to pick Haniger off third -- unsuccessfully. Ceddanne Rafaela then bobbled a potential double play ball, allowing all runners to end up safe -- and the tying run to score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith one out, Paxton departed and in came righty Zack Kelly, whose July struggles continued. Justin Turner drove in a run on a ground ball to give the Mariners a 4-3 lead. Then after a walk, Dylan Moore broke it open with a bases-clearing, three-run double off the Green Monster to put Seattle up four.\n\nPaxton, who was re-acquired Friday from Los Angeles, was tagged with six runs in 4 \u2153 innings but only two were earned. He struck out five and allowed six hits.\n\nBefore the third, the Red Sox jumped to an early lead. Two innings after a Turner RBI single in the first inning of his Mariners debut opened the scoring, Devers answered with an opposite field, three-run shot off Luis Castillo to put the Sox up. Jorge Polanco's solo homer off Paxton in the fourth made it 3-2.\n\nThe Sox's issues containing Seattle's offense continued into the sixth behind righty Yohan Ram\u00edrez, making his team debut. Victor Robles and Randy Arozarena each singled before Polanco laced a two-out RBI double. Cal Raleigh scored on a wild pitch to make it 9-3. Then, on a double steal attempt, the Sox's third error of the evening sealed a big defeat when Connor Wong overthrew second base and allowed Polanco to score.\n\nCastillo limited the Red Sox to six hits over six strong innings before the Sox closed the gap against Seattle's bullpen in the seventh. Devers' third hit of the night -- an RBI single off Tayler Saucedo -- made it 10-4. Facing Collin Snider, Tyler O'Neill laced a rocket single to cut it to five. Smith, who hit the ball hard all night, put things within reach with an opposite-field double off the Monster. But that's as close as the Red Sox got.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news",

He struck out three.\n\nRafael Devers hit a three-run homer for Boston in the third. The Red Sox added three more runs in the seventh, but could not complete a comeback from the 10-3 deficit.\n\nThe Red Sox made three errors, including two in the fifth, when the Mariners chased starter James Paxton (8-3), and another in the sixth.

Right-hander Logan Gilbert, one of the best pitchers in baseball, was on the mound for the Mariners, sporting a 2.72 ERA.\n\nBoston pounded Gilbert for seven runs, knocking him out of the game after just 2 2/3 innings en route to commanding 14-7 victory. The win helped them move within a half game of the third wild-card spot.\n\n\"We've had a slow start to the second half, no secret there,\" said Wilyer Abreu, whose clutch 12-pitch at-bat with two outs in the third sparked a seven-run outburst. \"But we just got to keep staying focused. Keep battling. And we know we have a next day. We know we have a next game to win and that's how we approach it.\"\n\nAll season the Red Sox have shown an intangible brand of scrappiness, overcoming injuries, errors, rookie mistakes, offensive droughts and pitching meltdowns. They've proven they can fight for a postseason spot and deserve reinforcements. Will chief baseball officer Craig Breslow deliver?\n\nA team source indicated on Monday the club is still very much in the mix to add pitching while a right-handed hitting infielder with versatility is also on the to-do list.\n\n\"They're working. They're working hard,\" manager Alex Cora said before the game about the front office. \"So we just got to be patient.\"\n\nBoston's rough stretch since the All-Star break hasn't been because of its offense. They've scored five or more runs in eight of 10 games since the break. Pitching remains the biggest need entering the 6 p.m. deadline and not bolstering the pitching beyond the starter James Paxton, who takes the mound Tuesday, would be a rough look for Breslow.\n\nDespite those recent pitching woes, Nick Pivetta did his part on Monday to help reset the bullpen, throwing 6 2/3 innings, rebounding from a rocky outing in Colorado. He allowed three runs on six hits and a walk while striking out 10.\n\nBut the story off the night was the offense and the fact that they were able to bounce back after a rough weekend against such a good pitcher.\n\nJarren Duran beat out a would-be double play in the third inning, reaching on a fielder's choice and Connor Wong scored on a wild pitch. With two outs, Abreu battled Gilbert for 12 pitches, fouling off pitch after pitch, before slicing a single to right to make it 2-0.\n\nThen the onslaught began. Two batters later, Masataka Yoshida crushed a two-run homer. Rafael Devers and Tyer O'Neill doubled for another run. Dom Smith added another double to make it 6-0, knocking Gilbert from the game. Wong added his second double of the inning to plate another run, but got caught trying to steal third.\n\nThe Red Sox finished the night with 11 extra-base hits, their most since 2019. Yoshida had a three-hit night and drove in four runs.\n\n\"That's what they do, right?\" Cora said of his offense. \"We've been talking about it. I know, I said over and over again, you've just got to turn the page and be ready for the next one.\"\n\nStill Cora admitted the weekend against the Yankees took its toll on the team.\n\n\"We kind of needed it to be honest with you,\" Cora said of the commanding win. \"The weekend, yeah we lost the series, but it was like every pitch it felt like it meant a lot. Probably bigger than what it really was, right? But it was very intense and to be able to breathe a little bit today, it was good for us.\"\n\nAnd now the trade deadline has arrived, marking the final time to improve the club with 57 games left on the schedule. It's Breslow's turn to make a move.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jen_mccaffrey@nytimes.com", "name": "Jen McCaffrey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Breslow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Breslow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Wong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarren_Duran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarren Duran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masataka_Yoshida", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masataka Yoshida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_DiMaggio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dom DiMaggio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/29232734/GettyImages-2164287376-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773732", "eventUri": "eng-9773732", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

He struck out three.\n\nRafael Devers hit a three-run homer for Boston in the third. The Red Sox added three more runs in the seventh, but could not complete a comeback from the 10-3 deficit.\n\nThe Red Sox made three errors, including two in the fifth, when the Mariners chased starter James Paxton (8-3), and another in the sixth. Paxton, picked up by Boston in a trade last week with the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitched 4 1/3 innings, allowing six runs on six hits and struck out five.\n\nThe Mariners had 11 at-bats in the fifth. A throwing error by first baseman Dominic Smith followed by a fielder's choice loaded the bases for Seattle. Shortstop Ceddanne Rafaela pulled Smith off the bag and allowed Randy Arozarena to reach on a fielder's choice -- after a successful challenge by the Mariners overturned the original call.\n\nJustin Turner drove in a run with a fielder's choice, Polanco drew a walk and then Moore hit a double off reliever Zack Kelly off of the Green Monster to clear the bases for three more runs.\n\nReliever Yohan Ram\u00edrez allowed a run to score on a wild pitch in the sixth, then Ram\u00edrez hit Mitch Garver. Garver stole second and when Boston catcher Connor Wong's throw bounced into center field Polanco scored.\n\nTurner made his debut for the Mariners one day after Seattle acquired him in a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays. Turner, who spent last season with the Red Sox, drove in a pair of runs and Arozarena, who just joined Seattle over the weekend after a trade with Tampa Bay, also drove in a run.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM'\n\nRed Sox: SS Ceddanne Rafaela spent a few minutes with trainers after getting hit by a pitch in the bottom of the fifth.

In the game at Fenway Park, the Red Sox could not cash in.\n\nOne of their additions in returning starter James Paxton made his first start back in a Boston uniform after coming back to the Red Sox in a trade with the Dodgers. He pitched well through four innings before a disastrous fifth inning unfolded behind him.\n\nFrom a missed strike call to defensive miscues, the Mariners scored five ruins in the frame with just three hits and a hit-by-pitch while the Red Sox committed a pair of errors. Seattle tacked on against the Boston bullpen in the sixth inning and tallied nine runs across the middle three frames of the game.\n\nBoston's bats rallied back in the game to score at least six runs for the eighth time in 11 games since the All-Star break before Seattle ultimately sealed the win.\n\nSTARS OF THE GAME\n\n-- Rafael Devers lifted his 24th home run of the season.\n\n-- Dominic Smith drove in a run and smacked two doubles for the Red Sox.\n\n-- Seattle's Jorge Polanco homered and scored three runs.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Red Sox and Mariners wrap up the three-game series on Wednesday afternoon at Fenway Park.

I'm comfortable here and just excited to be a part of what we got going on.\"\n\nPaxton, 35, made 18 starts for the Dodgers this season and went 8-2 with a 4.43 ERA. He allowed three runs in five-plus innings and struck out seven to earn the win in the 9-6 victory over Boston earlier this month -- then was designated for assignment the next day.\n\nPaxton, who went 7-5 with a 4.50 ERA in 19 starts for the Red Sox last season, allowed two runs in five innings and earned the win in his only career start against Seattle, on Aug. 28, 2019. He spent the first six seasons of his major league career with the Mariners (2013-18), then returned for another stint in 2021 that ended after one game when he needed Tommy John surgery.\n\nRight-hander Luis Castillo (8-10, 3.38 ERA) is scheduled to start for Seattle, which had its three-game winning streak end when Boston prevailed 14-7 on Monday. Castillo is 1-2 with a 5.06 ERA in three career appearances (all starts) against the Red Sox. On Opening Day this year, he lost to Boston after giving up four runs in five innings.\n\nCastillo will be facing a Red Sox team that collected 16 hits in the series opener, including a season-high 11 extra-base hits. Boston scored seven runs with two outs in the third inning, which included a two-run home run by Masataka Yoshida.\n\nThe designated hitter had three hits and four RBIs in the win, and he is batting .347 with three doubles, three home runs and 20 RBIs in his past 20 games. Yoshida will carry a six-game hitting streak into the Tuesday game.\n\nBoston entered the Monday matchup coming off back-to-back losses to the New York Yankees.\n\n\"We kind of needed (the win) to be honest with you,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. \"The weekend ... we lost the series, but every pitch it felt like meant a lot. Probably bigger than what it really is. It was very intense, and to be able to breathe a little bit (Monday) was good for us.\"\n\nSeattle could have Justin Turner in the lineup on Tuesday. The Mariners acquired Turner in a trade with Toronto on Monday. He hit .257 with six home runs, 17 doubles and 31 RBIs in 90 games with the Blue Jays this season. He has been used primarily as a designated hitter this year -- similar to last year when he played for the Red Sox.\n\n\"I just think, 'pro' -- this guy's been around a long time,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"He's gone through a lot in his career.

James Paxton will bolster the starting rotation, Danny Jansen will provide an important right-handed bat off the bench, and once they arrive relievers Lucas Sims and Luis Garcia should help lift Boston's bullpen up off the mat.\n\nBut prior to Tuesday night's game, manager Alex Cora made a comment that proved prophetic about one weakness the club will have to address on its own.\n\n\"Obviously the defense needs to improve,\" Cora said. \"And we've been working hard on that.\"\n\nThough not the catastrophe it was most of last season, the Red Sox have slipped into a lot of old habits on defense recently, and Tuesday night the club may have hit its nadir. For the second time in three nights Boston committed three errors, leading to a sloppy and embarrassing 10-6 loss to the Seattle Mariners.\n\nThe errors collectively resulted in five unearned runs, most of which came in a hideous five-run top of the fifth that may have been among the Red Sox worst of the season.\n\nLeading 3-2 thanks to a three-run home run by Rafael Devers in the bottom of the third, the Red Sox allowed a leadoff single and put men on second and third after Dom Smith threw the ball away on a bunt single by Leo Rivas. Then followed back to back fielder's choice opportunities that resulted in all runners being safe, the latter of which included a fielding error by shortstop Ceddanne Rafaela and resulted in Mitch Haniger scoring to tie the game.\n\nSeattle subsequently took the lead on an RBI groundout by Justin Turner, and after Jorge Polanco walked to load the bases Dylan Moore sent everyone home with a three-run double off the Green Monster that was only a couple of feet short of going for a grand slam.\n\nThe defensive miscues let down Paxton, who made his first start back with the Red Sox since being acquired from the Dodgers on Friday. The veteran lefty allowed six runs (three earned) on six hits over 4.1 innings with one walk and a solo home run to Polanco in the top of the fourth. He also struck out five, reaching 1,000 career strikeouts in the process.\n\nTuesday also marked another tough night for right-hander Zack Kelly, who walked two men and allowed the three-run double over just 0.1 inning of work.\n\nThe sixth inning didn't go much better for the Red Sox. The Mariners scored three more times thanks in part to a throwing error by Connor Wong and an erratic debut by new pitcher Yohan Ramirez. The recently claimed right-hander logged 1.1 innings, and during that time he hit two batters, gave up an RBI double to Polanco and allowed a run to score on a wild pitch.\n\nBy that point it was 10-3, and though the Red Sox had one last push in them, the seven-run deficit proved too much to overcome.\n\nBoston scored three times in the bottom of the seventh to get back within striking distance. Rafaela was hit by a pitch for the second time in the game to lead off the inning, Jarren Duran singled, and after Wilyer Abreu struck out, Masataka Yoshida reached on a fielder's choice to put runners at the corners with two outs. Devers, Tyler O'Neill and Dominic Smith then came through with three consecutive scoring hits, with Devers and O'Neill each firing off RBI singles before Smith ripped an RBI double to left.\n\nDevers ultimately finished 3 for 4 with a home run, a double and four RBI. He finished a triple shy of hitting for the cycle.\n\nThere will be better nights for Boston, and getting Sims and Garcia into the mix starting Wednesday should go a long way towards stabilizing a Red Sox pitching staff that's been hemorrhaging runs for two weeks now. In 11 games since the All-Star break the club has now allowed 92 runs, an average of 8.3 per game, which is obviously unsustainable for a club with playoff aspirations.\n\nBut while the Red Sox brought in more arms, their defensive alignment pretty much is what it is, and it's imperative that nights like Sunday against the Yankees or Tuesday against the Mariners don't become the norm. First chance to turn things around will be Wednesday afternoon, when the Red Sox (56-50) aim to take two of three from Seattle (57-52).

The Red Sox kicked off their three-game set against the Mariners with a matchup against Logan Gilbert, a 2024 All-Star who carried a 2.72 ERA into the series opener at Fenway Park.\n\nBut Boston got the best of the 6-foot-6 right-hander, who turned in the shortest outing (2 2/3 innings) since his rookie season in 2021. Gilbert was tagged for seven earned runs on seven hits, which included three doubles and a two-run home run, before exiting the contest.\n\nThe Red Sox went on to tack on seven more runs and cruised to a win they really needed. Nearly every Boston starter was part of Monday night's hit parade, but Alex Cora singled out one of them after the game.\n\n\"Before the game, Raffy (Rafael Devers) was talking about the approach,\" Cora told reporters, per The Boston Globe. \"If you don't stay with the fastball to left-center, then (his other pitches) are going to play and you are going to chase. I think the guys did an outstanding job of using the big part of the field.\"\n\nDevers wasn't the only Red Sox player who was vital in setting the tone for Boston against the playoff-hopeful Mariners. One of Wilyer Abreu's best at-bats of the season saw the second-year outfielder smack an RBI single on the 12th pitch he received from Gilbert in the third inning.\n\nWith momentum back on their side, the Red Sox will try to keep it rolling Tuesday when they meet the M's for the middle game of their series.

It's just about baseball.\n\nAs Hickory High head coach Norman Dale famously said in Hoosiers, \"This is your team.\"\n\nWell, sort of.\n\nThe Mariners are still without J.P. Crawford and Julio Rodriguez, who are both on the injured list and back in Seattle, and reliever J.T. Chargois, who was acquired in a trade with the Marlins earlier in the day, has yet to report.\n\nBut any success or failure over the next 53 games will essentially come from the players within the organization. There are no outside reinforcements coming.\n\nTuesday night was another step in that direction.\n\nWith a lineup featuring their latest acquisition, first baseman Justin Turner, the Mariners rolled to a decisive 10-6 victory over the Red Sox.\n\n\"I think there's a sense of relief and I think there's a sense of excitement amongst our players,\" manager Scott Servais said of the deadline being over and mentioning the trades to land Turner, Randy Arozarena and Yimi Garcia. \"With the additions that we were able to make, our organization stepped up. That means a lot, especially to a team who's probably predominantly a young team. Those guys are pros, and they're going to be really good. They're going to have some rough spots along the way, but they're going to teach our young guys a lot as we go through the next couple of months. So I'm really excited about it, as is everybody in that clubhouse.\"\n\nA night after scoring seven runs, but still getting drubbed by seven runs, the Mariners reached double-digit runs for the fifth time this season and the second time on the current road trip, highlighted by Dylan Moore's three-run double in a five-run fifth inning.\n\nTurner made his presence felt in his first plate appearance as a Mariner. With Victor Robles on second, the veteran right-handed hitter punched a two-strike single into right field to give Seattle a 1-0 lead in the top of the first off of old friend James Paxton. Turner later added another RBI on a hard ground ball to first base, also with two strikes.\n\n\"He's such a pro and a credit to him,\" Servais said. \"He's been in the league a long time. He doesn't take it for granted, but I'm looking forward to having him continue to impact our team. He's been here one day and just the talk amongst our hitters and how to go about at-bats and you just watched what he does. He just doesn't give anything away.\"\n\nSeattle got a quality start from Luis Castillo, who pitched six innings, allowing three runs on six hits with a walk and four strikeouts.\n\nHis three runs allowed came in the third inning. Pitching with a 1-0 lead, Castillo issued a one-out walk to Wilyer Abreu and gave up a single to Masataka Yoshida. Facing the always-dangerous Rafael Devers, Castillo got up 0-2 on a called first-pitch strike and a swing and miss on a fastball at the top of the strike zone. He went back to that same pitch for the strikeout, but Devers was able to get on top of it and sent a fly ball over the Green Monster for a three-run opposite-field homer.\n\n\"I think I was surprised more that it went out than that he hit it,\" Castillo said through interpreter Freddy Llanos. \"I felt like in any other ballpark that had a chance to get it out. But it was a good pitch replacement, but he was able to contact it and hit a home run. So all the credit to him.\"\n\nCastillo came back to retire the next two batter to end the inning and he'd work the next three scoreless allowing only two hits.\n\nThe Mariners picked up a run in the fourth inning on Jorge Polanco's solo homer over the monster. It was his 10th homer of the season and fourth on this road trip.\n\nBut thanks to a pair of fielding miscues, the Mariners were able to roll up five runs in the fifth inning. Two errors and another missed play by the Red Sox allowed the Mariners to tie the game and then load the bases for Moore, who launched a double just off the top of the monster. It was just a foot from being a grand slam.\n\n\"I haven't played here enough to know what's going to go and what's not,\" Moore said. \"I knew hit it pretty good. If you hit a fly ball to left, you put your head down and run. If it goes over, it goes over and if not you try to get a double.\"\n\nThe Mariners picked up three more runs in the sixth inning against another old friend, reliever Yohan Ramirez. Polanco hit a RBI double off the wall Cal Raleigh scored on a wild pitch and Polanco later scored on a throwing error by catcher Connor Wong on Moore's stolen base attempt.\n\n\"Really excited about our offense,\" Servais said. \"The guys are really starting to come together. Certainly, the additions have helped, but some of the guys that have been here all year are picking it up as well.\"\n\nThe Red Sox picked up three runs in the seventh off Tayler Saucedo to make it closer than it needed to be. But lockdown innings from Garcia and Andres Munoz ended the game.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Chargois", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

That's when the Red Sox gave the veteran all the run support he needed, racked up seven runs in the bottom of the third.\n\nAlthough Pivetta gave up a sacrifice fly the following inning, he still kept the Mariners at bay by forcing whiffs and painting corners.\n\nPivetta struck out two in the first, one in the second, one in the third, on in the fourth and two in the fifth. Seattle finally got to the righty with back-to-back homers in the sixth, but he still added two more strikeouts that inning.\n\nJust before he got the hook in the top of the seventh, Pivetta struck out left fielder Jason Vosler swinging, giving him 10 Ks on the day. Boston led 14-3 at the time.\n\nIt marked the 16th double-digit strikeout performance on Pivetta's career. According to TSN's StatsCentre, that ties him for the third-most in MLB history by a Canadian-born pitcher.\n\nFergie Jenkins owns the Canadian record with 48 such games. James Paxton ranks second with 17, while Ryan Dempster and Erik Bedard are tied for third with Pivetta.\n\nThe entire top five has pitched for the Red Sox at one point or another - Jenkins in 1976 and 1977, Bedard in 2011 and Dempster in 2013. Paxton, meanwhile, pitched in Boston in 2023 and just reunited with the club via a trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday.\n\nPivetta wound up going 6.2 innings deep on Monday, allowing six hits, one walk and three earned runs. The 31-year-old pending free agent is now 5-7 with a 4.47 ERA, 1.169 WHIP and 1.2 WAR through 17 starts this season.\n\nThe Red Sox and Mariners resume their series Tuesday at 7:10 p.m. ET.

It's just about baseball.\n\nAs Hickory High head coach Norman Dale famously said in Hoosiers, \"This is your team.\"\n\nWell, sort of.\n\nThe Mariners are still without J.P. Crawford and Julio Rodriguez, who are both on the injured list and back in Seattle, and reliever J.T. Chargois, who was acquired in a trade with the Marlins earlier in the day, has yet to report.\n\nBut any success or failure over the next 53 games will essentially come from the players within the organization. There are not outside reinforcements coming.\n\nTuesday night was another step in that direction.\n\nWith a lineup featuring their latest acquisition, first baseman Justin Turner, the Mariners rolled to a decisive 10-6 victory over the Red Sox.\n\n\"I think there's a sense of relief and I think there's a sense of excitement, amongst our players,\" manager Scott Servais said of the deadline being over and mentioning the trades to land Turner, Randy Arozarena and Yimi Garcia. \"With the additions that we were able to make, our organization stepped up. That means a lot, especially to a team who's probably predominantly a young team. Those guys are pros, and they're going to be really good. They're going to have some rough spots along the way, but they're going to teach our young guys a lot as we go through the next couple of months. So I'm really excited about it, as is everybody in that clubhouse.\"\n\nA night after scoring seven runs, but still getting drubbed seven runs, the Mariners reached double-digit runs for the fifth time this season and the second time on the current road trip, highlighted by Dylan Moore's three-run double in a five-run fifth inning.\n\nSeattle got a quality start from Luis Castillo, who pitched six innings, allowing three runs on six hits with a walk and four strikeouts.\n\nHis three runs allowed came in the third inning. Pitching with a 1-0 lead, Castillo issued a one-out walk to Wilyer Abreu and gave up a single to Masataka Yoshida. Facing the always-dangerous Rafael Devers, Castillo got up 0-2 on a called first-pitch strike and a swing and miss on a fastball at the top of the strike zone. He went back to that same pitch for the strikeout, but Devers was able to get on top of hit and sent a fly ball over the Green Monster for a three-run opposite-field homer.\n\nCastillo came back to retire the next two batter to end the inning and he'd work the next three scoreless allowing only two hits.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_divish@seattletimes.com", "name": "Ryan Divish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Chargois", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He has nasty stuff, and hitters really struggle off him. Castillo is having a fantastic month of July, as well. In his four starts this month, Castillo has thrown 25.2 innings, and his ERA is just 1.40. Castillo needs to continue his hot July in this game if the Mariners want to win. Seattle does not get a lot of run support, so it will be up to Castillo.\n\nPaxton is back in Boston, but do not let his record fool you. He has a high WHIP, and will allow baserunners. The Mariners need to take pitches and let the game come to them. Seattle is not the best offensive team, so taking their walks and the occasional extra base will be the key to winning this game.\n\nWhy The Red Sox Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nBoston has Paxton back on the mound, and he has a chance to have a great game here. Seattle has the second-worst batting average, third-worst slugging percentage, and their expected batting average is actually the lowest in the MLB. Seattle also has the third-highest whiff rate. Paxton should be able to get some swings and misses while limiting the walks, the Red Sox should be able to win this game Tuesday night.\n\nThe Red Sox have faced Castillo once already this season. Now, that was the his first start of the year, but they still faced him nonetheless. In that game, the Red Sox put up six hits, four runs, and they chased Castillo after just five innings. If the Red Sox can have another game like that against Castillo, they will be able to win this game.\n\nFinal Mariners-Red Sox Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be a good game. Both of these teams are pretty good, and their pitchers are more than capable of having good games. The Red Sox seem to be the better team right now, but Paxton does struggle. For that reason, I am leaning towards the Mariners and Luis Castillo. I am going to take the Mariners moneyline in this game. The Mariners are a good team, and they have made a couple good trades heading into this one.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(second_baseman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (second baseman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1c16fae0-4cfa-11ef-9af8-464a34c7c349.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773732", "eventUri": "eng-9773732", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

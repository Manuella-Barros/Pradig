nurse who was distributing medication.\n\nIn an interview with WREG, the victim said that the inmate was standing in the hallway without restraints.\n\nThe Sheriff's office says they are still investigating why the inmate was not handcuffed and why he was not with an officer.\n\nSheriff Floyd Bonner recently told WREG that staffing shortages and an outdated building have created numerous safety concerns.\n\nHe said in many instances inmates are using items to jam the doors to prevent them from fully closing.\n\n\"It leads to fights,\" Bonner said. \"It leads to all kinds of things because these detainees can get out when they want to instead of when we allow them to.\"\n\nHe says they're also down 400 officers at the jail and have been working to fill those positions.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office says the disturbances Friday night are a prime example of their critical need for a new jail and increased personnel.\n\n\"We want to be clear, even with our staffing shortages and

Chief Deputy Anthony Buckner told FOX13 there are currently about 2,100 inmates housed at 201 Poplar, but they only have about 460 jailers.\n\nHe said for the jail to run as efficiently as it's supposed to, they need about 800, almost double that number. \"Unfortunately, the jail is an unpredictable environment,\" Buckner told FOX13.\n\nHe acknowledged those adjustments are not always perfect. He said, \"We're down somewhere around 400 correctional officers, but we're making adjustments constantly.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Buckner issued a statement after four inmates were injured in what the sheriff's office called a 'disturbance' at the jail. In that statement, Buckner said, \"[T]his incident is an example of the critical need for a new jail and increased corrections personnel.\"\n\nRELATED: 4 inmates injured after fire set inside 201 Poplar, cell doors broken, SCSO says\n\nSheriff Floyd Bonner also brought up staffing after the death of Deion Byrd, an inmate stabbed to death by another inmate in a holding area outside of a courtroom.\n\nThe latest report card from the jail shows in March, the most recent data available, jailers worked more than 15,000 HOURS of overtime. That's up from 12,000 and 13,000 in the two previous months. \"We try to make sure that we are staffing the areas as best we can. Obviously, it's no secret we have staffing issues, and we continue to try to market the agency to grant more people to become members of the sheriff's office.\"\n\nLast month, FOX13 told you Sheriff Bonner announced plans to remove his staff from the Youth Justice Center and bring those officers back to 201 Poplar instead.

Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner has called for a new jail facility to be built, citing the age of 201 Poplar, which was built about 40 years ago.\n\nIn late February, the jail put in a request for a new boiler system -- a $2.2 million emergency purchase -- after spending months with a smaller, rented boiler due to the jail's original system failing.\n\nA $250,000 feasibility study into the prospects of building a new jail was passed by the Shelby County Board of Commissioners in early April. A bill in the Tennessee General Assembly that would have allowed Shelby County voters to approve a sales tax increase to failed in a mid-March subcommittee vote, the Daily Memphian reported. Those increased tax revenues would have been used to fund a new jail.\n\nLucas Finton is a criminal justice reporter with The Commercial Appeal.

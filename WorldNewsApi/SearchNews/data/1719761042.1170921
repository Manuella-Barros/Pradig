{"id": 225043832, "title": "Gang kingpin behind 14kg cocaine and \u00a3600k heroin network caged for 15 years", "text": "Adam Oakley, a Tyneside drug gang boss, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. Oakley was the ringleader of a large-scale and profitable cocaine and heroin distribution network, which resulted in up to 14kg of cocaine and \u00a3600,000 being confiscated. The 39-year-old has three previous convictions for dealing class A drugs, including in 2008 and 2012. In 2015, he received a 10-year sentence for conspiracy to supply cocaine, amphetamine and cannabis. Oakley was apprehended after his associates, Rebecca Rowley and Samantha Tait, were caught in a cocaine deal in Cumbria while under covert surveillance. Oakley, of no fixed address, was the head of the organised crime group, and convicted killer driver Richard Elmore, 43, of Front Street, Tynemouth, played a managerial role in the operation. Callum Craggs, 28, of Irthing Avenue, Walker, Newcastle, a trusted associate of Oakley, procured high-end vehicles for Oakley and on six occasions collected and transported large sums of money, reports Chronicle Live. On Wednesday, all three men appeared for sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, via link from HMP Durham. Oakley and Elmore were sentenced for conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin between February and June 2022. Craggs was sentenced for money laundering and had pleaded guilty on the basis he didn't know the extent of the offending. Police confiscated a swanky \u00a350,000 Audi RS4 and a Land Rover Discovery from Craggs' residence, which were leased with Oakley footing the bills. Investigations also revealed that Craggs had searched online for information on whether the police could track him. Elmore, with four prior convictions including one for causing death by careless driving in 2019, and Craggs, with a history of 12 previous convictions, faced justice. During an earlier session, Fiona Lamb, defending Oakley, stated: \"I don't seek to try to diminish his role in this organisation, he has been very frank about his role in it. He has three children, he was a family man and had full contact with all of his children and now has a grandchild and another on the way. He regrets that he has yet again become involved in this type of criminality, not only for himself but for his family who it will affect for years to come.\" Adam Birkby, representing Elmore, highlighted that a head injury made his client susceptible to being taken advantage of, and that Elmore's drug addiction was tied to the substances he was caught distributing. Birkby pointed out that despite Elmore's involvement, he did not lead a lavish lifestyle and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Jonathan Crawford, speaking for Craggs, mentioned that his client hadn't fully paid off the cars before his arrest, as they were financed by Oakley. Crawford expressed hope that Craggs would eventually resume his career as a car mechanic. Judge Stephen Earl sentenced the three men, handing Oakley a 15-year prison term and a five-year serious crime prevention order, which will commence upon his release. The court was informed that he had been apprehended at Glasgow Airport after arriving from Mexico. Elmore received a six-year sentence, while Craggs was imprisoned for 41 months. Rowley, 30, of Falmouth Road, North Shields and Tait, 33, of Greenlea, North Shields, admitted to supplying cocaine last month and were each sentenced to 32 months in prison.

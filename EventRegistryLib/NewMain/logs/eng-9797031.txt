near flashpoint reef as US holds joint drills", "body": "A Chinese navy ship sails near Scarborough Shoal, in disputed waters of the South China Sea in Febuary 2024 - Copyright AFP Saeed KHAN\n\nChina carried out a combat patrol to test \"strike capabilities\" near a flashpoint reef in the South China Sea on Wednesday, as the United States and its allies held joint military drills in the same waters.\n\nTensions in the disputed waterway have spiked following a series of escalating confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels that have fanned fears of a wider conflict that could draw in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims of several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\n\nIts claims include the waters around Scarborough Shoal -- which Beijing seized from Manila in 2012 -- where the Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said Wednesday it had held joint sea and air patrols.\n\nThe triangular chain of reefs and rocks is 240 kilometres (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nBeijing said the manoeuvres tested \"the reconnaissance and early warning, rapid mobility, and joint strike capabilities of theatre troops\".\n\nThe announcement came as the Philippines on Wednesday launched two days of sea and air exercises with the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Philippine military said those drills were taking place west of the Philippine island of Palawan, which is south of Scarborough Shoal and the nearest major landmass to the also-contested Spratly Islands.\n\nAmong the vessels deployed by the four powers were the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Erie and a Philippine guided missile frigate and patrol ship, Manila's military said.\n\nSeparately, the Chinese coastguard also conducted a patrol on Wednesday to \"uphold its rights\" around another group of disputed islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan, Beijing's state media said.\n\n- 'Meant to intimidate' -\n\nPhilippine military spokesman Xerxes Trinidad said initial reports showed \"no trace of Chinese military activity\" near Scarborough Shoal on Wednesday, apart from the usual presence of \"Chinese maritime militia vessels\".\n\nHowever, three Chinese naval vessels had \"tailed\" the four-nation drills, he said.\n\nChina has long used its coastguard to assert its claims in the South China Sea, which analysts describe as \"grey zone\" harassment tactics that fall short of an outright act of war.\n\nAnd while the Chinese military had been deployed near Scarborough Shoal in the past, one analyst told AFP Wednesday's action showed they were \"becoming more aggressive and forceful\".\n\n\"It's meant to intimidate,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the Manila-based Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said.\n\n\"It's definitely meant to send a message, a show of force,\" he added.\n\nDuan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, said the fact China had specifically mentioned the shoal showed its \"mounting dissatisfaction with Manila's recent collaborative efforts with its allies and partners\".\n\nBeijing's use of combat patrols in retaliation, he said, \"suggests that the Philippines has now become China's second most-targeted adversary, trailing only Taiwan\", the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.\n\n- 'Aggravate tensions' -\n\nRecent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have focused on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where a handful of Filipino troops are stationed on a navy vessel that Manila deliberately grounded on the reef in 1999 to assert its claims to the area.\n\nOne of the most serious incidents took place in June, when Chinese sailors brandishing weapons including knives and an axe boarded Philippine naval vessels during a resupply mission to the strategic reef.\n\nThe Philippine military said one of its sailors lost a thumb in the confrontation in which Beijing's coastguard also confiscated or destroyed Philippine equipment including guns.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nIn recent weeks the Philippines and China agreed on a \"provisional arrangement\" for resupplying Filipino troops at Second Thomas Shoal and also to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the waterway.\n\nLast month, the United States said it would provide $500 million in additional military funding to the Philippines, which has been modernising its armed forces.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".",

west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nChina in 2012 used coastguard vessels to take control of the shoal, a triangular chain of reefs and rocks that are part of a rich fishing ground and had long been used by Filipino fishermen as a safe harbour.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Chinese military's Southern Theater

escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Philippines and China have agreed on a \"provisional arrangement\" for resupplying Filipino troops stationed on Second Thomas Shoal and also to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the waterway.\n\nLast month, the United States said it would provide $500 million in additional military funding to the Philippines to combat Beijing's growing assertiveness.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".\n\nThe investment \"will only lead to greater insecurity\" for Manila, it warned.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the

Wednesday, as the United States and its allies held joint military drills in the same waters.\n\nTensions in the disputed waterway have spiked following a series of escalating confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels that have fanned fears of a wider conflict that could draw in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims of several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\n\nIts claims include the waters around Scarborough Shoal -- which Beijing seized from Manila in 2012 -- where the Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said Wednesday it had held joint sea and air patrols.\n\nThe triangular chain of reefs and rocks is 240 kilometres (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nBeijing said the manoeuvres tested \"the reconnaissance and early warning, rapid mobility, and joint strike capabilities of theatre troops\".\n\nThe announcement came as the Philippines on Wednesday launched two days of sea and air exercises with the United States, Canada and Australia, according to a joint statement.\n\nA Philippine military spokesman told AFP the drills were taking place in the West Philippine Sea, which is what Manila calls the South China Sea waters to the immediate west of the archipelago.\n\nThe Chinese coastguard also conducted a separate patrol on Wednesday to \"uphold its rights\" around another group of contested islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan, Beijing's state media said.\n\n'Meant to intimidate'\n\nChina has long used its coastguard to assert its claims in the South China Sea, which analysts describe as \"grey zone\" harassment tactics that fall short of an outright act of war.\n\nAnd while the Chinese military had been deployed

the Manila-based Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said.\n\n\"It's definitely meant to send a message, a show of force,\" he added.\n\nDuan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, said the fact China had specifically mentioned the shoal showed its \"mounting dissatisfaction with Manila's recent collaborative efforts with its allies and partners\".\n\nBeijing's use of

Spratly Islands, where a handful of Filipino troops are stationed on a navy vessel that Manila deliberately grounded on the reef in 1999 to assert its claims to the area.\n\nOne of the most serious incidents took place in June, when Chinese sailors brandishing weapons including knives and an axe boarded Philippine naval vessels during a resupply mission to the strategic reef.\n\nThe Philippine military said one of its sailors lost a thumb in the confrontation in which Beijing's coastguard also confiscated or destroyed Philippine equipment including guns.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nIn recent weeks the Philippines and China agreed on a \"provisional arrangement\" for resupplying Filipino troops at Second Thomas Shoal and also to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the waterway.\n\nLast month, the United States said it would provide $500 million in additional military funding to the Philippines, which has been modernising its armed forces.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".\n\nThe investment \"will only lead to greater insecurity\" for Manila, it warned.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title":

fanned fears of a wider conflict that could draw in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims of several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\n\nIts claims include the waters around Scarborough Shoal -- which Beijing seized from Manila in 2012 -- where the Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said Wednesday it had held joint sea and air patrols.\n\nThe triangular chain of reefs and rocks is 240 kilometres (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nBeijing said the manoeuvres tested \"the reconnaissance and early warning, rapid mobility, and joint strike capabilities of theatre troops\".\n\nThe announcement came as the Philippines on Wednesday launched two days of sea and air exercises with the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Philippine military said those drills were taking place west of the Philippine island of Palawan, south of Scarborough Shoal and the nearest major landmass to the also-contested Spratly Islands.\n\nAmong the vessels deployed by the four powers were the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Erie and a Philippine guided missile frigate and patrol ship, Manila's military said.\n\nPhilippine General Romeo Brawner said the exercise \"underscores the commitment of our nations to ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region\", adding it would also \"enhance our collective capabilities\".\n\nSeparately, the Chinese coastguard also conducted a patrol on Wednesday to \"uphold its rights\" around another group of disputed islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan, Beijing's state media said.\n\n- 'Meant to intimidate' -\n\nChina has long used its coastguard to assert its claims in the South China Sea, which analysts

Flashpoint Reef As US Holds Joint Drills", "body": "China carried out a combat patrol to test \"strike capabilities\" near a flashpoint reef in the South China Sea on Wednesday, as the United States and its allies held joint military drills in the same waters.\n\nTensions in the disputed waterway have spiked following a series of escalating confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels that have fanned fears of a wider conflict that could draw in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims of several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\n\nIts claims include the waters around Scarborough Shoal -- which Beijing seized from Manila in 2012 -- where the Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said Wednesday it had held joint sea and air patrols.\n\nThe triangular chain of reefs and rocks is 240 kilometres (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nBeijing said the manoeuvres tested \"the reconnaissance and early warning, rapid mobility, and joint strike capabilities of theatre troops\".\n\nThe announcement came as the Philippines on Wednesday launched two days of sea and air exercises with the United States, Canada and Australia, according to a joint statement.\n\nA Philippine military spokesman told AFP the drills were taking place in the West Philippine Sea, which is what Manila calls the South China Sea waters to the immediate west of the archipelago.\n\nThe Chinese coastguard also conducted a separate patrol on Wednesday to \"uphold its rights\" around another group of contested islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan, Beijing's state media said.\n\nChina has long used its coastguard to assert its claims in the South China Sea, which analysts describe as \"grey zone\" harassment tactics that fall short of an outright act of war.\n\nAnd while the Chinese military had been deployed near Scarborough Shoal in the past, one analyst told AFP Wednesday's action showed they were \"becoming more aggressive and forceful\".\n\n\"It's meant to intimidate,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the Manila-based Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said.\n\n\"It's definitely meant to send a message, a show of force,\" he added.\n\nDuan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, said the fact China had specifically mentioned the shoal showed its \"mounting dissatisfaction with Manila's recent collaborative efforts with its allies and partners\".\n\nBeijing's use of combat patrols in retaliation, he said, \"suggests that the Philippines has now become China's second most-targeted adversary, trailing only Taiwan\", the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.\n\nBut Ja-Ian Chong, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, said it would be best to wait and \"see what the drill actually involves\".\n\n\"If the tit-for-tat remains restrained, then it's just posturing by the different sides,\" he told AFP.\n\nRecent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have focused on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where a handful of Filipino troops are stationed on a navy vessel that Manila deliberately grounded on the reef in 1999 to assert its claims to the area.\n\nOne of the most serious incidents took place in June, when Chinese sailors brandishing weapons including knives and an axe boarded Philippine naval vessels during a resupply mission to the strategic reef.\n\nThe Philippine military said one of its sailors lost a thumb in the confrontation in which Beijing's coastguard also confiscated or destroyed Philippine equipment including guns.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nIn recent weeks the Philippines and China agreed on a \"provisional arrangement\" for resupplying Filipino troops at Second Thomas Shoal and also to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the waterway.\n\nLast month, the United States said it would provide $500 million in additional military funding to the Philippines, which has been modernising its armed forces.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate

in the disputed waterway have spiked following a series of escalating confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels that have fanned fears of a wider conflict that could draw in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims of several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\n\nIts claims include the waters around Scarborough Shoal -- which Beijing seized from Manila in 2012 -- where the Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said Wednesday it had held joint sea and air patrols.\n\nThe triangular chain of reefs and rocks is 240 kilometres (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nBeijing said the manoeuvres tested \"the reconnaissance and early warning, rapid mobility, and joint strike capabilities of theatre troops\".\n\nThe announcement came as the Philippines on Wednesday launched two days of sea and air exercises with the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Philippine military said those drills were taking place west of the Philippine island of Palawan, which is south of Scarborough Shoal and the nearest major landmass to the also-contested Spratly Islands.\n\nAmong the vessels deployed by the four powers were the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Erie and a Philippine guided missile frigate and patrol ship, Manila's military said.\n\nSeparately, the Chinese coastguard also conducted a patrol on Wednesday to \"uphold its rights\" around another group of disputed islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan, Beijing's state media said.\n\nPhilippine military spokesman Xerxes Trinidad said initial reports showed \"no trace of Chinese military activity\" near Scarborough Shoal on Wednesday, apart from the usual presence of \"Chinese maritime militia vessels\".\n\nHowever, three Chinese naval vessels had \"tailed\" the four-nation drills, he said.\n\nChina has long used its coastguard to assert its claims in the South China Sea, which analysts describe as \"grey zone\" harassment tactics that fall short of an outright act of war.\n\nAnd while the Chinese military had been deployed near Scarborough Shoal in the past, one analyst told AFP Wednesday's action showed they were \"becoming more aggressive and forceful\".\n\n\"It's meant to intimidate,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the Manila-based Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said.\n\n\"It's definitely meant to send a message, a show of force,\" he added.\n\nDuan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, said the fact China had specifically mentioned the shoal showed its \"mounting dissatisfaction with Manila's recent collaborative efforts with its allies and partners\".\n\nBeijing's use of combat patrols in retaliation, he said, \"suggests that the Philippines has now become China's second most-targeted adversary, trailing only Taiwan\", the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.\n\nRecent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have focused on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where a handful of Filipino troops are stationed on a navy vessel that Manila deliberately grounded on the reef in 1999 to assert its claims to the area.\n\nOne of the most serious incidents took place in June, when Chinese sailors brandishing weapons including knives and an axe boarded Philippine naval vessels during a resupply mission to the strategic reef.\n\nThe Philippine military said one of its sailors lost a thumb in the confrontation in which Beijing's coastguard also confiscated or destroyed Philippine equipment including guns.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nIn recent weeks the Philippines and China agreed on a \"provisional arrangement\" for resupplying Filipino troops at Second Thomas Shoal and also to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the waterway.\n\nLast month, the United States said it would provide $500 million in additional military funding to the Philippines, which has been modernising its armed forces.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType":

sea patrols near flashpoint reef as US holds joint drills", "body": "Map showing the extent of disputed claims in the South China Sea.\n\nChina carried out a combat patrol to test \"strike capabilities\" near a flashpoint reef in the South China Sea on Wednesday, as the United States and its allies held joint military drills in the same waters.\n\nTensions in the disputed waterway have spiked following a series of escalating confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels that have fanned fears of a wider conflict that could draw in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, brushing off rival claims of several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, and an international ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\n\nIts claims include the waters around Scarborough Shoal -- which Beijing seized from Manila in 2012 -- where the Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said Wednesday it had held joint sea and air patrols.\n\nThe triangular chain of reefs and rocks is 240 kilometres (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nBeijing said the manoeuvres tested \"the reconnaissance and early warning, rapid mobility, and joint strike capabilities of theatre troops\".\n\nThe announcement came as the Philippines on Wednesday launched two days of sea and air exercises with the United States, Canada and Australia, according to a joint statement.\n\nA Philippine military spokesman told AFP the drills were taking place in the West Philippine Sea, which is what Manila calls the South China Sea waters to the immediate west of the archipelago.\n\nThe Chinese coastguard also conducted a separate patrol on Wednesday to \"uphold its rights\" around another group of contested islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan, Beijing's state media said.\n\n- 'Meant to intimidate' -\n\nChina has long used its coastguard to assert its claims in the South China Sea, which analysts describe as \"grey zone\" harassment tactics that fall short of an outright act of war.\n\nAnd while the Chinese military had been deployed near Scarborough Shoal in the past, one analyst told AFP Wednesday's action showed they were \"becoming more aggressive and forceful\".\n\n\"It's meant to intimidate,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the Manila-based Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said.\n\n\"It's definitely meant to send a message, a show of force,\" he added.\n\nMore from this section When Your Knee Cartilage Wears Out, a 'Biomaterial' Might Help Replace It Snoring Could Signal Heart Disease Risk Shah Rukh Khan to be honoured at Locarno Film Festival\n\nDuan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, said the fact China had specifically mentioned the shoal showed its \"mounting dissatisfaction with Manila's recent collaborative efforts with its allies and partners\".\n\nBeijing's use of combat patrols in retaliation, he said, \"suggests that the Philippines has now become China's second most-targeted adversary, trailing only Taiwan\", the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.\n\nBut Ja-Ian Chong, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, said it would be best to wait and \"see what the drill actually involves\".\n\n\"If the tit-for-tat remains restrained, then it's just posturing by the different sides,\" he told AFP.\n\n- 'Aggravate tensions' -\n\nRecent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have focused on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where a handful of Filipino troops are stationed on a navy vessel that Manila deliberately grounded on the reef in 1999 to assert its claims to the area.\n\nOne of the most serious incidents took place in June, when Chinese sailors brandishing weapons including knives and an axe boarded Philippine naval vessels during a resupply mission to the strategic reef.\n\nThe Philippine military said one of its sailors lost a thumb in the confrontation in which Beijing's coastguard also confiscated or destroyed Philippine equipment including guns.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nIn recent weeks the Philippines and China agreed on a \"provisional arrangement\" for resupplying Filipino troops at Second Thomas Shoal and also to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the waterway.\n\nLast month, the United States said it would provide $500 million in additional military funding to the Philippines, which has been modernising its armed forces.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".\n\nThe investment \"will only lead to greater insecurity\" for Manila, it warned.\n\nburs-mjw/oho/amj", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_walsh@reformer.com",

The exercises appear to be a response to same-day military manoeuvres by the United States, Australia, Canada and the Philippines.\n\nThe Chinese manoeuvres tested the reconnaissance and early warning capabilities of its troops, Beijing said.\n\n\"All military activities that disrupt the South China Sea, create hotspots, and undermine regional peace and stability are all being controlled to the best extent,\" it noted.\n\nIn a joint statement, military chiefs from the US, Australia, Canada and the Philippines said they \"stand together to address common maritime challenges and underscore our shared dedication to upholding international law and the rules-based order\".

reefs and rocks that form part of a rich fishing ground, which had long served as a safe harbour for Filipino fishermen.\n\nConfrontations have also been focused around a warship grounded for years by Manila on the contested Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nIn June, Chinese coastguards armed with knives and axes boarded Philippine naval vessels near the strategic reef with one sailor losing a thumb and Philippine equipment seized or destroyed.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nLast month, the US said it would provide $500m in additional military funding to the Philippines to combat Beijing's growing assertiveness in the region.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".\n\nThe investment \"will only lead to greater insecurity\" for Manila, it warned.\n\nIn addition to China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have been locked in separate but increasingly tense territorial disputes in the waterway, which is regarded as a potential flashpoint and a delicate fault line in the US-China regional rivalry.\n\nThe US military has deployed navy ships and fighter jets for decades in what it calls freedom of navigation and overnight patrols, which China

Holds Joint Drills - UrduPoint", "body": "Tensions in the disputed waterway have spiked following a series of escalating confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels that have fanned fears of a wider conflict that could draw in the United States due to its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nBeijing said the manoeuvres tested \"the reconnaissance and early warning, rapid mobility, and joint strike capabilities of theatre troops\".\n\nThe announcement came as the Philippines on Wednesday launched two days of sea and air exercises with the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Philippine military said those drills were taking place west of the Philippine island of Palawan, south of Scarborough Shoal and the nearest major landmass to the also-contested Spratly Islands.\n\nAmong the vessels deployed by the four powers were the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Erie and a Philippine guided missile frigate and patrol ship, Manila's military said.\n\nPhilippine General Romeo Brawner said the exercise \"underscores the commitment of our nations to ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region\", adding it would also \"enhance our collective capabilities\".\n\nChina has long used its coastguard to assert its claims in the South China Sea, which analysts describe as \"grey zone\" harassment tactics that fall short of an outright act of war.\n\n\"It's meant to intimidate,\" Jay Batongbacal, director of the Manila-based Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said.\n\n\"It's definitely meant to send a message, a show of force,\" he added.\n\nDuan Dang, a Vietnam-based maritime security analyst, said the fact China had specifically mentioned the shoal showed its \"mounting dissatisfaction with Manila's recent collaborative efforts with its allies and partners\".\n\nBeijing's use of combat patrols in retaliation, he said, \"suggests that the Philippines has now become China's second most-targeted adversary, trailing only Taiwan\", the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.\n\nRecent clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have focused on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where a handful of Filipino troops are stationed on a navy vessel that Manila deliberately grounded on the reef in 1999 to assert its claims to the area.\n\nOne of the most serious incidents took place in June, when Chinese sailors brandishing weapons including knives and an axe boarded Philippine naval vessels during a resupply mission to the strategic reef.\n\nThe Philippine military said one of its sailors lost a thumb in the confrontation in which Beijing's coastguard also confiscated or destroyed Philippine equipment including guns.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nIn recent weeks the Philippines and China agreed on a \"provisional arrangement\" for resupplying Filipino troops at Second Thomas Shoal and also to increase the number of communication lines to resolve disputes in the waterway.\n\nLast month, the United States said it would provide $500 million in additional military funding to the Philippines, which has been modernising its armed forces.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc",

They said the two-day exercises were being held to uphold unhindered passage in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nStandoff\n\nBeijing and Manila have been locked in a tense standoff in recent months, as China continues to press claims to almost the entire South China Sea, despite an international tribunal ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.\n\nScarborough Shoal is 240km (150 miles) west of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and nearly 900km (560 miles) from the nearest major Chinese land mass of Hainan.\n\nIn 2012, China deployed coastguard vessels to seize control of the shoal, a triangular chain of reefs and rocks that form part of a rich fishing ground, which had long served as a safe harbour for Filipino fishermen.\n\nConfrontations have also been focused on a warship grounded for years by Manila on the contested Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nIn June, Chinese coastguards armed with knives and axes boarded Philippine naval vessels near the strategic reef with one sailor losing a thumb and Philippine equipment seized or destroyed.\n\nBeijing blamed the escalation on Manila and maintains its actions to protect its claims are legal and proportional.\n\nLast month, the US said it would provide $500m in additional military funding to the Philippines to combat Beijing's growing assertiveness in the region.\n\nBeijing said in response that \"wooing countries from outside the region to provoke confrontation... will only undermine regional stability and aggravate tensions\".\n\nThe investment \"will only lead to greater insecurity\" for Manila, it warned.\n\nIn addition to China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have been locked in separate but increasingly tense territorial disputes in the waterway, which is regarded as a potential flashpoint and a delicate fault line in the US-China regional rivalry.\n\nThe US military has deployed navy ships and fighter jets for decades in what it calls freedom of navigation and overnight patrols, which China has opposed and regards as a threat to regional stability.", "source": {"uri": "tv360nigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV360 Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri":

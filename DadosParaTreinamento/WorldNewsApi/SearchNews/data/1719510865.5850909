But before then, on Monday, June 10, Apple will unveil the software that will run on that hardware\u2014and on plenty of current iPhones, too. Now, we have some indications of what\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s going to be big. Apple iOS 18 will be announced in a matter of days. SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images According to industry insider Mark Gurman from Bloomberg in his latest Power On newsletter, the iPhone screen will be customizable in all-new ways. ForbesApple iPhone 16 And iPhone 16 Plus: Everything We Know So FarBy David Phelan First of all, the iPhone home screen will be completely different. It will, Gurman says, \u201cLet users change the color of app icons and put them wherever they want. For instance, you can make all your social icons blue or finance-related ones green\u2014and they won\u2019t need to be placed in the standard grid that has existed since day one in 2007.\u201d This will make every iPhone look radically different from how it has, and from every other iPhone. Place apps so they look like eyes and a mouth, color action games so they\u2019re blood-red, platform games a gaudy yellow, or leave one whole home page free of all apps apart from the bottom drawer, perhaps.

The June 10 keynote is expected to focus heavily on AI, which, Gurman says, will also provide at least one remarkable new look to the iPhone: AI-generated emoji. Gurman says, \u201cOne standout feature will bring generative AI to emojis. The company is developing software that can create custom emojis on the fly, based on what users are texting. That means you\u2019ll suddenly have an all-new emoji for any occasion, beyond the catalog of options that Apple currently offers on the iPhone and other devices.\u201d How often have you been searching for just the right emoji, only to settle for a less exact option, leaving the person you\u2019re messaging thinking, \u201cWhat on earth do they mean by that?\u201d There will be plenty more changes coming: Gurman has previously claimed that Apple employees have told him that iOS 18 will be the biggest iPhone software release ever.

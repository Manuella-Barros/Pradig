{"id": 231972836, "title": "After massive assist to BJP in Karnataka, H D Kumaraswamy set for Central govt debut with post in new Modi govt", "text": "Once dubbed the \u201caccidental Chief Minister\u201d by Karnataka BJP, Mandya MP and JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy will now be among the ministers in the third Narendra Modi-led NDA government. This is the first time Kumaraswamy will be a Central government minister. Known for his pro-farmer stance and often criticised for his lack of ideological commitment, Kumaraswamy's rise in politics is largely attributed to his father and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda. A film producer and distributor under the Channambika Films banner, the two-time Karnataka CM played a prominent role in the impressive performance of the BJP-JD(S) coalition in south Karnataka, where it won 12 of the 14 seats. The strong showing by the JD(S) helped the BJP hold ground in a lot of areas and it ended up winning 17 seats while the Congress bagged 9, much lower than what it had expected. He won the Lok Sabha polls from Mandya, defeating his nearest rival Venkatramane Gowda of the Congress by 2.84 lakh votes. The youngest son of Gowda and viewed as his political heir, Kumaraswamy is the only leader in Karnataka to have allied with both the BJP and the Congress to become the CM. He is the eighth member of the Deve Gowda family in active politics. Both his wife Anita Kumaraswamy and actor-turned-politician son Nikhil Kumaraswamy have contested multiple elections in recent years. His first tenure as CM was in 2006, after he along with 42 JD(S) legislators withdrew support from the N Dharam Singh-led Congress-JD(S) coalition government. Kumaraswamy then allied with the BJP to form the \u201c20-20\u201d government, where the two parties entered a power-sharing agreement of 20 months each \u2013 an agreement the JD(S) leader later reneged on. The first time Kumaraswamy became the CM was also the first time he was elected as an MLA. After registering his first win in the 1996 Lok Sabha polls, he lost the next three elections \u2014 two Lok Sabha and one Assembly election \u2014 before winning the 2004 Assembly polls. Since then, the three-time MP and five-time MLA has lost only one of the six elections he has contested to cement his position as one of the tallest Vokkaliga leaders in the state. His second stint as CM was the short-lived coalition with Congress in 2018, when the government lasted little more than a year and collapsed after the controversial \u201cOperation Lotus\u201d orchestrated by the BJP. In his first term, Kumaraswamy gained acclaim for banning single number lottery in the state. The farm loan waiver of Rs around Rs 34,000 crore benefitting around 17 lakh farmers was the major announcement during his second tenure. \u201cI am not pushing for any Cabinet berth. If I get Agriculture, I will be happy as I am interested in the sector from the beginning,\u201d Kumaraswamy told reporters in Delhi on Sunday. The JD(S) leader's tenure as Union Minister is expected to boost the regional party that suffered its worst drubbing in recent years in last year\u2019s Assembly polls, where it could win only 19 seats and lost in some of its strongholds, raising serious concerns about its future. The tide turned in this year\u2019s Lok Sabha polls when the JD(S) succeeded in rallying its vote base behind the coalition. The party won two of the three seats it contested and helped the BJP win at least eight constituencies where it has a strong presence. His grip over the party unit, especially after the waning influence of Deve Gowda, has attracted a lot of criticism as many JD(S) leaders resigned from the party after he assumed charge. S R Srinivas who quit the JD(S) in 2023 and is currently a Congress MLA accused Kumaraswamy of running the party as a business enterprise. \u201cHis one-point programme is to seek votes in the name of Vokkaligas and subjugate them later,\u201d Srinivas said. Kumaraswamy\u2019s ideological shift from the party's secular credentials is more recent after he squarely blamed Muslims for JD(S)'s poor performance in the Assembly polls. He was also seen hobnobbing with RSS leaders such as Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat whom he had accused of triggering communal tensions in the state in the past. Kumaraswamy's decades-long rivalry with Karnataka Deputy CM and state Congress president D K Shivakumar is also a prominent feature of Vokkaliga politics as both leaders vie for prominence among voters from the community. After his nephew and former Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna\u2019s videos of allegedly sexually assaulting women came to light, Kumaraswamy consistently pinned the blame on Shivakumar, accusing him of resorting to such tactics for electoral gains.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-karnataka-hd-kumaraswamy-central-govt-new-modi-govt-9381635/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/HDK.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:28:13", "author": "Akram M", "authors": ["Akram M"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.117}

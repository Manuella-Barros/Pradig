FIFA received this review months ago but has yet to disclose or act on its findings,\" said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International's Head of Labour Rights and Sport.\n\nThis delay only prolongs the suffering of families who lost loved ones, and workers who were abused, while delivering FIFA's flagship event.\n\n\"This delay only prolongs the suffering of families who lost loved ones, and workers who were abused, while delivering FIFA's flagship event. FIFA cannot erase this pain but it can set out a clear plan to deliver justice and commit some of its vast resources towards remedying the harms it has contributed to.\"\n\n\"The contents of the report may make uncomfortable reading for FIFA but there is overwhelming public support for it to act and no excuse for stalling any longer. A commitment to remedying the abuses related to the last World Cup would be a vital step towards FIFA finally fulfilling its human rights responsibilities and could be life-changing for workers and their families.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of migrant workers suffered grievously while working to deliver the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Extreme heat and unsafe working conditions also led to many workers losing their lives, with the Qatari authorities failing to investigate the deaths of thousands of workers across the country in the decade leading up to the tournament.\n\nOther workers paid extortionate recruitment fees for jobs but were later cheated out of the money they were promised and endured appalling working conditions or other abuses including forced labour. The situation has left many financially and emotionally shattered and unable to rebuild their lives.\n\nBy awarding the tournament to Qatar in 2010, without first ensuring sufficient safeguards were in place to protect human rights, FIFA contributed to more than a decade of abuses which have not been remedied. In recent years FIFA has made reforms to its statutes and guidelines to better acknowledge its human rights obligations but serious doubts remain about its commitment to uphold them.\n\nFIFA is currently considering awarding hosting rights for the 2030 and 2034 men's World Cup tournaments. A joint bid from Spain, Portugal and Morocco is the only one submitted for 2030, and Saudi Arabia is the sole bidder for 2034.\n\n\"FIFA cannot simply move on to other tournaments leaving suffering in its wake, not least when the opportunity to finally put things right is within its grasp. It is past time for FIFA to publish the review, fully address abuses related to the last World Cup and finally deliver for the workers who made the tournament possible,\" said Steve Cockburn.\n\nFIFA will hold its annual congress on 17 May in Bangkok in Thailand with members of football associations from 211 states expected to attend.\n\nPolling has shown there is broad public support for FIFA to establish a mechanism to compensate workers who were abused in Qatar, and for human rights to be a critical consideration in FIFA's selection of all tournament hosts. Victims' access to a fund set up by Qatar in 2020 is rife with obstacles. Payments are capped, and it is nearly impossible for workers or families to apply after they have returned to their home countries.\n\nAmnesty International and the #PayUpFIFA coalition have campaigned for FIFA to establish and finance its own compensation scheme, and called for FIFA's 2022 World Cup Legacy Fund to be used to remediate abuses.

Currently, victims' access to a fund set up by the Qatari authorities in 2020 is rife with obstacles. Payments are capped and it is nearly impossible for workers or families to apply to it after they've returned to their home countries. Amnesty and the #PayUpFIFA coalition have campaigned for FIFA to establish and finance its own compensation scheme, and called for FIFA's 2022 World Cup Legacy Fund to be used to remediate abuses.

helped to deliver the 2022 World Cup in Qatar\n\nFIFA came under pressure on Thursday to publish a long-awaited review into compensation for workers who helped to deliver the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International urged FIFA to make public the findings of an independent review it said was delivered five months ago.\n\nAmnesty said hundreds of thousands of migrant workers \"suffered grievously\" while building state-of-the-art stadia and infrastructure, often in searing heat, to enable Qatar to host a World Cup that FIFA president Gianni Infantino described at the best in tournament history.\n\nLast November, Amnesty urged Qatar and FIFA to do more for migrant workers, particularly in terms of compensation.\n\n\"This delay only prolongs the suffering of families who lost loved ones, and workers who were abused, while delivering FIFA's flagship event,\" Amnesty head of labor rights and sport Steve Cockburn said. \"A commitment to remedying the abuses related to the last World Cup would be a vital step towards FIFA finally fulfilling its human rights responsibilities and could be life-changing for workers and their families.\"\n\nFIFA said the report was still being reviewed by stakeholders.\n\n\"Generally speaking, international experts and trade union representatives who have assessed and collaborated in the labor rights programme for FIFA World Cup workers have repeatedly testified to the robustness of this program and recognized that major steps forward have occurred in the labor rights sphere,\" it said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nWith an estimated population of less than 3 million and only around 300,000 citizens, Qatar relied on migrant workers to build more than $200 billion worth of stadiums and infrastructure after it was controversially awarded the 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe treatment of foreign workers, some of whom died in the process of delivering the tournament, was the focus of criticism for more than 10 years.\n\nAs well as concerns about the potentially hazardous construction industry, there was criticism of the kafala employment system, which previously gave employers control over whether migrant workers could change jobs or even leave the country.\n\nReforms have been introduced following the World Cup but Amnesty has said migrant workers still face abuses.\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to host the 2034 World Cup as the sole bidder.\n\n\"FIFA cannot simply move on to other tournaments leaving suffering in its wake, not least when the opportunity to finally put things right is within its grasp,\" Cockburn said.\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "source": {"uri":

Qatari official Hassan al-Thawadi later denied those reports, telling Piers Morgan that \"between 400 and 500\" died.\n\nQatar has made efforts to improve on human rights since the World Cup, eliminating the kafala system, introducing a minimum monthly wage and safety rules for construction workers.

Qatar came under intense pressure over its treatment of foreign workers working in extreme conditions, leading many to raise concerns, although the Middle Eastern country has denied that workers were exploited.\n\nAmnesty said FIFA should publish and act on a review \"assessing its human rights responsibilities\" towards workers, saying its findings were approved by FIFA's Council in March. \"Ahead of its annual congress next week, FIFA should make public the review it ordered into the organisation's responsibilities to redress human rights abuses related to the 2022 World Cup,\" said Steve Cockburn of the rights group.\n\n\"FIFA received this review months ago but has yet to disclose or act on its findings,\" added Cockburn, the group's head of labour rights and sport, who called for a rapid and positive response to the recommendations. \"This delay only prolongs the suffering of families who lost loved ones and workers who were abused while delivering FIFA's flagship event.\n\n\"The contents of the report may make uncomfortable reading for FIFA but there is overwhelming public support for it to act and no excuse for stalling any longer.\" In response, FIFA said stakeholders were studying and discussing the review.\n\n\"The findings will be published in due course once the review process has been completed,\" a FIFA spokesperson told Reuters. \"International experts and trade union representatives who have assessed and collaborated in the labour rights programme for FIFA World Cup workers have repeatedly testified to the robustness of this programme and recognised that major steps forward have occurred in the labour rights sphere.\"\n\nThe review process is not expected to be completed before the FIFA Congress on May 17 in Bangkok. In 2022, Amnesty and other rights groups had led calls for FIFA to compensate migrant workers in Qatar for human rights abuses by setting aside $440 million, matching the World Cup prize money.\n\nAt the World Cup in Doha, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said a workers' support and insurance fund set up in 2018 by Qatar had provided compensation of more than $350 million to workers in cases mainly related to non-payment of wages.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIBA_Women's_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2022 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labor rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Infantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianni Infantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Migrant worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_04_05_4766438.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551691", "eventUri": "eng-9551691", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 2415, "textEnd": 2421}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

We have reached the point where this situation must immediately be addressed both from a procedural and substantive perspective,\" the letter said.\n\nFIFPRO has become increasingly concerned about the physical and mental health of players in the face of growing demands.\n\nLast season, Manchester United and Portugal midfielder Bruno Fernandes made 70 appearances for club and country, including a run of 20 consecutive games as a result of the World Cup in Qatar being staged midway through the campaign.\n\nManchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri played in 10 different competitions.\n\nThere have been claims that such demands could lead to burnout, injuries and the premature curtailing of careers.\n\nConcerns will hardly be alleviated by European soccer\u00b4s governing body UEFA changing the Champions League format from next season, with two additional games. The European Championship has also been expanded in recent years.\n\nA report last year by FIFPRO analyzed the impact of what it described as \"extreme calendar congestion.\" It said 43% of World Cup players surveyed had experienced \"extreme or increased mental fatigue.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contacted FIFA for comment.\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nFILE -FIFA President Gianni Infantino walks on the stage before the start of the 69th FIFA congress in Paris, Wednesday, June 5, 2019.

The lineup includes Champions League finalists Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund plus Manchester City and Bayern Munich.\n\nAlso Read | KL Rahul To Resign As LSG Captain?

More Saudi sponsorship is expected with the kingdom set to host the 2024 men's World Cup.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has consistently said the extra money and playing opportunities are needed to raise the level of teams from outside Europe and South America, which traditionally dominate the World Cup and other international events.

World soccer body FIFA has deepened its ties to Saudi Arabia by confirming a sponsorship with the Middle East kingdom's state oil firm Aramco.\n\nGENEVA (AP) -- FIFA has been warned of legal action from players and national leagues if it does not backtrack on adding new and bigger competitions to the congested calendar of men's international soccer.\n\nFIFA is criticized for \"unilateral decisions that benefit its own competitions and commercial interests\" -- including the World Cup and expanded 32-team Club World Cup that debuts next year -- in a letter sent by global players union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Association seen on Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nThe letter claims it is \"inherently abusive\" for FIFA to continue adding games while forcing players and leagues to adapt.\n\nFIFA is urged to reschedule the revamped Club World Cup due in the United States in June 2025. The lineup includes Champions League finalists Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund plus Manchester City and Bayern Munich.\n\nThat month-long tournament will test stadiums and logistics for the first 48-team, 104-game men's World Cup staged one year later across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe unions and leagues also want FIFA to \"review its decision\" -- effectively scrap -- the Intercontinental Cup set for this December involving the same continental champions that will play in the Club World Cup six months later.\n\nTalks also should reopen on the FIFA-managed calendar through 2030 when clubs must release players for national team games, they wrote.\n\n\"FIFA has ignored repeated attempts by leagues and unions to engage on this issue,\" FIFPRO and World Leagues said, aiming to step up pressure before the soccer body's ruling council and congress of 211 member federations meet next week in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\n\"Should FIFA refuse to formally commit to resolving the issues, as set out above, at its upcoming council, we shall be compelled to advise our members on the options available to them, both individually and collectively, to proactively safeguard their interests,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"These options include legal action against FIFA on which we have now commissioned external expert advice,\" FIFPRO and Zurich-based World Leagues warn.\n\nFIFA has been contacted for comment.\n\nPlayer workloads and domestic fixture schedules also are being squeezed by UEFA's expansion of its three season-long club competitions.\n\nTeams in the Champions League and Europa League next season will play two guaranteed extra games in an opening-stage schedule running from September through January instead of December, using 10 midweeks instead of six across the three competitions.\n\n\"Players are being pushed beyond their limits, with significant injury risks and impacts on their welfare and fundamental rights,\" FIFPRO and World Leagues warn, adding the fixture squeeze is harming the ability of leagues to organize properly.\n\nFIFA conservatively budgeted for more than $11 billion in revenue from 2023-26 -- about a 50% increase from the previous four years -- that did not include money from the inaugural Club World Cup expansion and a top-tier sponsorship confirmed last month with Saudi Arabian state oil firm Aramco. More Saudi sponsorship is expected with the kingdom set to host the 2024 men's World Cup.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has consistently said the extra money and playing opportunities are needed to raise the level of teams from outside Europe and South America, which traditionally dominate the World Cup and other international events.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "source":

Soccer's global governing body previously lost a case against European Super League organizers. They then faced another lawsuit regarding a policy that blocks league games from happening in other countries. FIFA officials, however, recently came to an agreement with promoters Relevent Sports Group on the issue. As a result of deal, Relevent had to drop their court case against the governing body.\n\nWhile one case has been completed, another may be set to start. FIFPRO, the international players' union, has teamed up with the World Leagues to threaten a potential lawsuit against FIFA. The point of contention surrounds the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States next summer. Officials previously revealed plans to expand the competition from seven clubs to 32.\n\nUEFA will see the most teams feature at the tournament. Twelve European sides highlight the teams on display in the United States. CONCACAF, the hosting confederation, will have a total of five teams. Four of those are CONCACAF Champions Cup winners, such as the Seattle Sounders and Monterrey. Also, one additional MLS team will compete in the tournament.\n\nThe decision to expand the Club World Cup has not gone down well with the players and their union. There are concerns about player welfare and safety because of the added matches at a time when many players typically rest.\n\nNot only has FIFPRO publicly condemned FIFA's decision to expand the competition, but the World Leagues has now joined forces with the union. The World Leagues is a group that officially represents professional soccer leagues around the globe.\n\nAccording to New York Times reporter Tariq Panja, the two groups have contacted the governing body to inform them that they have taken legal advice over the issue. Both FIFPRO and the World Leagues recently submitted a letter to FIFA executives asking them to make alterations to the expanded Club World Cup schedule or face potential time in court.\n\n\"Should FIFA refuse to formally commit to resolving the issues ... at its upcoming council, we shall be compelled to advise our members on the options available to them, both individually and collectively, to proactively safeguard their interests,\" the letter sent to the governing body reads. \"These options include legal action against FIFA, on which we have now commissioned external expert advice.\"\n\nFIFA will now have to make a major decision in the coming months. Will they move forward with FIFA president Gianni Infantino's wishes to heavily expand the competition and face the lawsuit? Or will the organization back down from its plans to avoid yet another potential legal headache?\n\nFIFA's final decision remains unclear. In all likelihood, it will be defiant in its approach. Nevertheless, player safety should be the top priority for the governing body. Injuries are increasing as players from top teams now play more games than ever. Not only have studies shown that injuries and physical fatigue are up, but mental health concerns are also on the rise as well.\n\nFIFA is expanding the Club World Cup to essentially generate more interest and money in the tournament. Many soccer fans typically tend to skip the annual contest played in the middle of many regular season schedules. While moving the competition to the summer should help, very few seem to support expanding the contest to include 32 teams.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIVB_Volleyball_World_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIVB Volleyball World League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFPRO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFPRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevent_Sports_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relevent Sports Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Sounders_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Sounders FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterrey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monterrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monterrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Infantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianni Infantino"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240509_WST_505802_FIFA-Club-Cup-USA.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551691", "eventUri": "eng-9551691", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

FIFA has been told to reschedule its inaugural expanded Club World Cup just over a year before the tournament is due to be hosted by America.\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) -- FIFA has been told to reschedule its expanded Club World Cup just over a year before the tournament is due to be staged in he United States.\n\nWorld players' union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Association are demanding reform of the international match calendar, which is controlled by soccer's world governing body.\n\nIn a letter obtained by The Associated Press, FIFA has been accused of pushing players \"beyond their limits, with significant injury risks\" by expanding its competitions.\n\nFIFPRO and the WLA say this is impacting players' welfare and their \"fundamental rights.\"\n\nA 32-team World Cup for clubs could be FIFA's answer to the dominance of the Champions League and English Premier League as one of the most popular and lucrative sports competitions in the world. But it has sparked concerns over the demands on players in an increasingly congested match calendar, which will include an expanded 48-team World Cup from 2026.\n\nThe new version of the Club World Cup is slated for June 15 to July 13 next year and will mean three straight years of major competitions during the usual offseason, given the European Championship and Copa America are being staged in this summer and the next World Cup is in 2026.\n\nFIFA has previously said the dates would be \"harmoniously aligned with the international match calendar\" to ensure sufficient rest for players ahead of the start of domestic leagues.\n\nBut FIFPRO and the WLA have are demanding the international calendar gets \"immediately amended.\"\n\nAs well as rescheduling the Club World Cup, they want to reopen discussions on the release periods for players from 2024-30 and review the \"Intercontinental Cup,\" which is effectively a replacement for the old Club World Cup, which was a short format event staged at the end of the year.\n\nThe letter warns legal action against FIFA could be considered if the governing body doesn't comply.\n\n\"Leagues and players cannot simply be expected to 'adapt' to FIFA's decisions, which are driven by FIFA's business strategy. We have reached the point where this situation must immediately be addressed both from a procedural and substantive perspective,\" the letter said.\n\nFIFPRO has become increasingly concerned about the physical and mental health of players in the face of growing demands.\n\nLast season, Manchester United and Portugal midfielder Bruno Fernandes made 70 appearances for club and country, including a run of 20 consecutive games as a result of the World Cup in Qatar being staged midway through the campaign.\n\nManchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri played in 10 different competitions.\n\nThere have been claims that such demands could lead to burnout, injuries and the premature curtailing of careers.\n\nConcerns will hardly be alleviated by European soccer's governing body UEFA changing the Champions League format from next season, with two additional games. The European Championship has also been expanded in recent years.\n\nA report last year by FIFPRO analyzed the impact of what it described as \"extreme calendar congestion.\" It said 43% of World Cup players surveyed had experienced \"extreme or increased mental fatigue.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contacted FIFA for comment.\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\nAP soccer:

But it has sparked concerns over the demands on players in an increasingly congested match calendar, which will include an expanded 48-team World Cup from 2026.\n\nThe new version of the Club World Cup is slated for June 15 to July 13 next year and will mean three straight years of major competitions during the usual offseason, given the European Championship and Copa America are being staged in this summer and the next World Cup is in 2026.\n\nFIFA has previously said the dates would be \"harmoniously aligned with the international match calendar\" to ensure sufficient rest for players ahead of the start of domestic leagues.\n\nBut FIFPRO and the WLA have are demanding the international calendar gets \"immediately amended.\"\n\nAs well as rescheduling the Club World Cup, they want to reopen discussions on the release periods for players from 2024-30 and review the \"Intercontinental Cup,\" which is effectively a replacement for the old Club World Cup, which was a short format event staged at the end of the year.\n\nThe letter warns legal action against FIFA could be considered if the governing body doesn't comply.\n\n\"Leagues and players cannot simply be expected to 'adapt' to FIFA's decisions, which are driven by FIFA's business strategy.

In a letter to world football's governing body, Fifpro and World Leagues have threatened FIFA with legal action over the plans. Clubs like Chelsea and Man City are set to compete under the new format at the Club World Cup in 2025.\n\nFootball's world governing body, FIFA, are being threatened with legal action by players who are set to participate in the new Club World Cup which is set to take place in the summer of 2025, according to a report from The Times. The international players' union, Fifpro, and the World Leagues organisation have called for change to the competition's current scheduling in a letter.\n\nThe tournament, which typically features teams from across the globe, including the winner of the Champions League, was given a major facelift in December 2022 when it was confirmed that starting from 2025, the competition would be reformatted to include 32 teams. The announcement was met with criticism by the Fifpro and the World Leagues Forum then, and little has changed in the year which has followed.\n\nTheir major gripe with the new format is the scheduling of the competition, and in a joint letter, they have now accused FIFA of making decisions which benefit their own interests while saying that the new football calendar is \"beyond saturation,\" which could harm domestic leagues and pose significant injury risk to the players.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Manchester City became the first English club ever to simultaneously hold the Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup when they won the competition in December 2023.\n\nWhat the Letter to FIFA Says Players want change at upcoming meeting\n\nIn their letter, the organisations said that they had taken legal advice, and they called on FIFA to reschedule the competition in their meeting which is set to take place in Bangkok next week. They also demanded that discussions over the international football calendar reopen.\n\nUnder current plans, the old Club World Cup will still be played but will be re-branded as the Intercontinetal Cup. The eventual Champions League winners will play in that competition in December, along with winners from the AFC Champions League, Copa Libertadores and other champions, before the new Club World Cup takes place in the United States in the summer of 2025. Fifpro and the World Leagues organisation want the Intercontinental Cup to be scrapped from the football calendar.\n\nIn their letter, per The Times, they say: \"Should FIFA refuse to formally commit to resolving the issues... at its upcoming council, we shall be compelled to advise our members on the options available to them, both individually and collectively, to proactively safeguard their interests. These options include legal action against FIFA, on which we have now commissioned external expert advice.\n\n\"FIFA has continually and consistently made unilateral decisions that benefit its own competitions and commercial interests, while negatively affecting national leagues and players. Over a significant period, FIFA has ignored repeated attempts by leagues and unions to engage on this issue.\n\n\"As a result of FIFA's recent strategy of expanding its own competitions, the calendar is now beyond saturation, to the point that national leagues are unable to properly organise their competitions, resulting in economic harm, whereas players are being pushed beyond their limits, with significant injury risks and impacts on their welfare and fundamental rights.\n\n\"If FIFA extends its own competitions, it is incumbent upon FIFA to adjust accordingly. Imposing the burden of adaptation on national leagues and players is inherently abusive.\"\n\nHow the New Club World Cup Will Work Chelsea and Man City both competing at the tournament\n\nIn the new competition, the 32 teams competing at the Club World Cup will be separated into eight groups of four, in a similar vein to the current Champions League format. The European competition is also getting a makeover for the 2024/25 season, with the group stage now becoming a single league.\n\nAfter the group stage is complete, the top two teams in each group will advance to the knockout stage of the competition. However, only a single match will be played to decide who moves on to the next round.\n\nRelated FIFA's New 32-Team Club World Cup: Format Changes & Teams Qualified Three English giants will be absent from the new tournament that will take place in 2025.\n\nAmong the competitors are the winners of the Champions League from 2020 onwards, so both Chelsea and Manchester City will be representing the Premier League in the competition, despite the former's lack of European football this season.

adding new and bigger competitions to the congested calendar of men's international football.\n\nFIFA was criticised for \"unilateral decisions that benefit its own competitions and commercial interests\" -- including the World Cup and expanded 32-team Club World Cup that debuts next year -- in a letter sent by global players union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Association seen on Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nThe letter claimed it was \"inherently abusive\" for FIFA to continue adding games while forcing players and leagues to adapt.\n\nFIFA was urged to reschedule the revamped Club World Cup due in the United States in June 2025, which includes Champions League finalists Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund plus Manchester City and Bayern Munich.\n\nALSO READ: Box owners at

staged one year later across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe unions and leagues also wanted FIFA to \"review its decision\" -- effectively scrap -- the Intercontinental Cup set for this December involving the same continental champions that will play in the Club World Cup six months later.\n\nTalks should also reopen on the FIFA-managed calendar through 2030 when clubs must release players for national team games, they wrote.\n\n\"FIFA has ignored repeated attempts by leagues and unions to engage on this issue,\" FIFPRO and World Leagues said, aiming to step up pressure before the football body's ruling council and congress of 211 member federations meet next week in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\n\"Should FIFA refuse to formally commit to resolving the issues, as set out above, at its upcoming council, we shall be compelled to advise our members on the options available to them, both individually and collectively, to proactively safeguard their interests,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"These options include legal action against FIFA on which we have now commissioned external expert advice,\" FIFPRO and Zurich-based World Leagues warn.\n\nFIFA has been contacted for comment.\n\nPlayer workloads and domestic fixture schedules also were being squeezed by UEFA's expansion of its three season-long club competitions.\n\nTeams in the Champions League and Europa League next season would play two guaranteed extra games in an opening-stage schedule running from September through January instead of December, using 10 midweeks instead of six across the three competitions.\n\nALSO READ: Brazil's bid to host the Women's World Cup tops European rival\n\n\"Players are being pushed beyond their limits, with significant injury risks and impacts on their welfare and fundamental rights,\" FIFPRO and World Leagues warn, adding the fixture squeeze is harming the ability of leagues to organise properly.\n\nFIFA conservatively budgeted for more than USD 11 billion in revenue from 2023-26 -- about a 50 percent increase from the previous four years -- that did not include money from the inaugural Club World Cup expansion and a top-tier sponsorship confirmed last month with Saudi Arabian state oil firm Aramco.\n\nMore Saudi sponsorship is expected with the kingdom set to host the 2024 men's World Cup.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has consistently said the extra money and playing opportunities are needed to raise the level of teams from outside Europe and South America, which traditionally dominate the World Cup and other international events.\n\nLatest on SportstarFIFA urged to review congested calendar or face legal action from player unions and leagues APPBKS vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2024: RCB 119/3 (10), Rain stops play; Kohli

The lineup includes Champions League finalists Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund plus Manchester City and Bayern Munich.\n\nThat month-long tournament will test stadiums and logistics for the first 48-team, 104-game men\u00b4s World Cup staged one year later across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe unions and leagues also want FIFA to \"review its decision\" - effectively scrap - the Intercontinental Cup set for this December involving the same continental champions that will play in the Club World Cup six months later.\n\nReal Madrid's Joselu, covered by his teammates, celebrates after scoring his side's second goal during the Champions League semifinal second leg soccer match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Wednesday, May 8, 2024.

More Saudi sponsorship is expected with the kingdom set to host the 2024 men's World Cup.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has consistently said the extra money and playing opportunities are needed

Next summer's tournament will include 12 European teams, six CONMEBOL clubs and four teams from CONCACAF and takes place in the U.S. between June 15 and July 13.\n\nFIFA says the Club World Cup schedule -- which will see 63 matches played between June 15 and July 13 -- has been aligned with the international match calendar to allow sufficient time between the tournament final and the start of the new season in domestic leagues across the globe to ensure player welfare is safeguarded.\n\nIt adds that the Club World Cup and Intercontinental Cup will only constitute 2.3 per cent of matches organised at club level across a four-year playing cycle.\n\nThe tournament had previously taken place annually, with seven teams competing. This competition will remain but has been rebranded as the Intercontinental Cup. FIFPro and the World Leagues Association have also requested FIFA reconsider this competition.\n\nFIFPro raised concerns over Club World Cup when the new format was first announced, saying it \"demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives\".\n\nThe European Club Association -- the body that represents the interests of teams taking part in UEFA club competitions -- meanwhile praised the revamped competition upon its announcement, calling it \"fantastic news for club football in general\".\n\nLast month, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters criticised FIFA for their lack of consultation over the competition.\n\n\"The feedback we have from players is that there is too much football being played,\" he said. \"If you pour more liquid into the cup that's already full, it will overflow.\"\n\nThe revamped tournament will contain eight groups of four teams, with side each playing each other once as the top two qualify for the knockouts, beginning with a last-16 round. Those knockout games will be single-legged and there will not be a third-place play-off.\n\nSubsequently, the international match calendar has been altered from 2025 to see one extended international break in late September and early October replacing two separate windows.\n\nThe Club World Cup previously took place around the turn of the calendar year, during the traditional European domestic season, but the 2025 edition will come in the middle of the year, during the North American and South American domestic seasons.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_crafton@theathletic.com", "name": "Adam Crafton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFPRO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFPRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIVB_Volleyball_World_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIVB Volleyball World League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_Cup_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental Cup (football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_International_Match_Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA International Match Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Club_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Club Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/12/22154926/GettyImages-1868363780-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551691", "eventUri": "eng-9551691", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "dateEnd": "-07-13", "textStart": 1593, "textEnd": 1612, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

More Saudi sponsorship is expected with the kingdom set to host the 2024 men's World Cup.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has consistently said the extra money and playing opportunities are needed to raise the level of teams from outside Europe and South America, which traditionally dominate the World Cup and other international events.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFPRO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFPRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIVB_Volleyball_World_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIVB Volleyball World League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_Cup_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental Cup (football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Infantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianni Infantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/2024042511048-662a723d3bf11053aa54bcacjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551691", "eventUri": "eng-9551691", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

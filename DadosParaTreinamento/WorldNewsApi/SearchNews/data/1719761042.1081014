{"id": 225077836, "title": "'Scandals and secrets': On board the world's most exclusive private residential ship", "text": "It\u2019s a floating city exclusively home to the 1 per cent, a playground for multimillionaires and billionaires that circumnavigates the world\u2019s oceans. Welcome to The World, an exclusive private residential ship home to 165 superluxe apartments. This vessel is shrouded in secrecy and buying a condo on board is an invite-only situation \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be nominated by one resident and seconded by another. A net worth of a cool US$10 million is said to be compulsory. If you\u2019re imagining decadent parties, filled with intrigue and free-flowing champagne \u2013 essentially a maritime episode of the HBO series \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d \u2013 you\u2019re perhaps not far off, at least according to one ex-passenger\u2019s account. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that everything that happened on \u2018The White Lotus\u2019 has happened on The World, but I think, in large measure, the comparison is not inaccurate,\u201d former resident Peter Antonucci tells CNN Travel. \u201cThere are a lot of wealthy people doing playful things, sometimes naughty things, sometimes scandalous things.\u201d Antonucci is a retired lawyer who spent six years as a resident of The World. In 2019, he sold up. His reasoning? \u201cOnce you\u2019ve circumnavigated the globe a few times, you\u2019ve seen it. I had seen what I wanted to see, I was ready to do something new.\u201d Back on dry land, Antonucci started going through the journals he\u2019d kept during his years on board and decided the \u201ccountry club meets sorority house\u201d vibe was the perfect inspiration for fiction. Antonucci\u2019s since written three novels set on a fictional ship, the most recent of which, \u201cTides of Betrayal,\u201d promises \u201csecrets, sins, and scandals\u201d on the high seas. An exclusive invite Antonucci and his wife heard about The World via an article in the Wall Street Journal, in around 2012. The 12-deck ship launched in 2002 and spans 644 feet. When he first heard about this floating city, Antonucci was 52 and enjoying the perks of early retirement. He was intrigued by the concept and his wife was also excited to learn more. Those interested are able to book a trial journey on The World as a \u201cprospective resident.\u201d So before long, Antonucci and his wife were boarding in Belize and sailing through the Panama Canal on their taster voyage. \u201cWhen I first got on, I thought it was ridiculously expensive. I couldn\u2019t believe the apartments cost so much. I couldn\u2019t believe the maintenance costs were so much and couldn\u2019t imagine why anybody would do this,\u201d says Antonucci. \u201cBut the second day, I was saying, \u2018How many apartments do you have available and when can I sign up?\u2019\u201d Antonucci says he was seduced by every aspect of The World \u2013 from the crew, which he calls \u201cthe greatest asset of the ship\u201d thanks to their ability to anticipate residents\u2019 every need, to the plethora of exclusive experiences on board the ship and on land, and the tightly planned itinerary. \u201cIt was like an orchestra with a lot of different parts. Each one was great. But together, it was a symphony,\u201d says Antonucci. Plus, all the current residents were very welcoming. Antonucci didn\u2019t discover until later that they\u2019d all been briefed in advance on who he was, and he says they\u2019d been encouraged to make him feel at home. \u201cWhen they bring prospective residents on, there\u2019s an email that goes to all the residents,\u201d says Antonucci. \u201cThere\u2019s a paragraph or two or three or more about the prospective resident\u2019s background, and inquiring whether you have anything in common with them. And [you are encouraged] if you see them to offer to buy them a drink, offer them dinner, play a round of tennis with them, do something. \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t know that was going on \u2013 I just thought it was coincidental that all these people came up and said nice things to me. But I got to know a few people, and felt good.\u201d If current residents like a prospective resident, says Antonucci, they can be their proposer. \u201cMany people come aboard already knowing people. But others took the \u2018prospective resident cruise\u2019 and met people there who ended up sponsoring them,\u201d he explains. Following the successful taster sail, Antonucci and his wife signed a contract to purchase a condo on The World. They closed four months later, in early 2014. Antonucci says they\u2019d have done it all sooner, but there were a few things to tie up on land. \u201cI had kids in New York and I have houses and things like that \u2013 you can\u2019t just pick up everything and run off to sea,\u201d says Antonucci. Antonucci\u2019s children were in their early 20s during his stint as a World resident, but they came and visited their parents on board from time to time. Peter Antonucci says he's owned four apartments on The World over the past few years. (Peter Antonucci via CNN Newsource) Million-dollar purchase Every apartment on The World is slightly different, \u201csome are going to be a little bigger than others, some could be a little smaller,\u201d says Antonucci. Antonucci can\u2019t recall the exact figures involved, but he believes he bought his first apartment on board for around $1.6 million. Unlike on an ordinary cruise ship, residents are able to make renovations and decorate according to personal tastes. That means \u201csome are decorated with modern furniture and really cool appliances, some haven\u2019t been touched in 20 years,\u201d according to Antonucci. And renovating an apartment on board a ship isn\u2019t super straight forward \u2013 there\u2019s no \u201crunning to Home Depot.\u201d \u201cEverything has to be inventoried and shipped months and months in advance in crates \u2013 it all has to be approved,\u201d says Antonucci. All in all, Antonucci owned four separate apartments during his five years on board The World. \u201cNot all at once,\u201d he explains. \u201cI had two at once. And then I had the other two separately.\u201d Antonucci upgraded each time to something a little swankier \u2013 he says the subsequent apartments he purchased were around $4 million. During the period when he owned two properties, he\u2019d offer the empty one to friends he invited on board. Planning by committee Most residents on board The World use their apartment as a vacation home of sorts \u2013 these are people who likely have multiple residences across multiple countries, and might be found private jetting their way across the globe at any given time. When the ship was voyaging Europe, Antonucci would regularly come and go, enjoying the luxuries of The World every other week or so, and heading home to New York in between. When the ship was further afield, he\u2019d usually stay on board for longer stretches. \u201cIf it was somewhere far away and it was a whole lot of fun, you know, in the Maldives or the Seychelles, Australia, New Zealand, somewhere like that, I would go and spend a good amount of time there,\u201d says Antonucci. \u201cIf the ship was somewhere interesting, I would always prefer to be on the ship.\u201d The World also times its arrival at certain ports with significant events \u2013 like London for Wimbledon, Rio de Janeiro for Carnival. On-board entertainment is also included in the annual service change and includes lectures from experts and organized activities such as snorkeling, diving, hiking. Guests aren\u2019t tied to the preorganized events. Antonucci recalls one time when the ship was \u201cdown south of the Panama Canal\u201d and he and his friends \u201cgot a plane or a boat and went down to the Galapagos and went snorkeling and diving for a few days.\u201d \u201cYou can go off on your own and do that, and then you catch up with the ship, wherever it is,\u201d he explains. The World\u2019s itinerary is planned two to three years in advance, says Antonucci. That planning is a \u201cvery complicated\u201d process, according to Antonucci. He says there\u2019s an itinerary committee, made up of residents that weighs in, focusing on the experiences available at each destination. Meanwhile Antonucci says the ship\u2019s itinerary director \u201clooks at things like fuel prices, crew changes, where you have the biggest airports, where you have the most accessibility, visa requirements, docking fees.\u201d The ships\u2019 captains also weigh in. Using this information, three potential itineraries are proposed to residents, who then vote on their preferred route. \u201cIt gets very political, as you can imagine,\u201d says Antonucci, who was a board member for some years. He says, in his experience, residents of The World tend to be \u201copinionated.\u201d \u201cEverybody is fairly affluent, and has made money \u2013 everybody thinks they have the smartest opinion and the best way to do things,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to being told no. And you\u2019ve got a lot of very opinionated people who have opinions on everything from where the salt shaker should be placed on the table, to how far south in the ice in Antarctica the ship should go.\u201d So if everyone on board The World has a pretty endless stream of disposable income, why don\u2019t they travel to wherever they want to go via privately-owned superyachts? Why do they opt to sail on a ship where the itinerary is voted by committee? \u201cOh, that\u2019s such an easy question,\u201d says Antonucci. \u201cMany of the people on board the ship had yachts too. I\u2019ve been a boater my whole life. The reason you\u2019d go on The World is so you don\u2019t have to deal with hiring crew, figuring out where to buy fuel, writing checks for every little thing. You just write one big fat check every year. And it\u2019s all taken care of.\u201d Antonucci has moved on from The World, but says he is thankful he got to travel the globe by sea. (Peter Antonucci via CNN Newsource) 'Scandals and secrets' For many residents, the social life on board The World is also a big part of the appeal. Antonucci calls the ship \u201ca very, very social community.\u201d While children are welcome on board The World, many of the offerings on board cater to adults \u2013 a full-sized tennis court, a vast spa and fitness center. There\u2019s also an extensive wine collection on board, and guests\u2019 food and drink is included in an annual service change. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of drinking, a lot of partying. And that\u2019s the fun of it,\u201d he says. When Antonucci was a resident, he says \u201cgentlemen wore jackets and ties.\u201d He was last on the ship, visiting friends, in November 2023 and says times have changed \u2013 he suggests now you\u2019re more likely to see people wearing shorts and tank tops than black tie. \u201cThat\u2019s a little unfortunate,\u201d says Antonucci, wistfully. A by-product of the thriving on board social scene was \u201cthere were affairs all over the place,\u201d according to Antonucci. CNN reached out to several other residents for their accounts of life on board, but they either didn\u2019t respond, or declined to comment. The World\u2019s owners also chose not to respond to Antonucci\u2019s account of life on board. CNN has been unable to corroborate his claims. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of drinking and carousing\u201d says Antonucci, which can lead to \u201cscandals and secrets.\u201d \u201cStuff happens,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of it is fun. Some of it is people just getting blasted and singing songs and just having a good old time. And that\u2019s relatively harmless. And then even some of the affairs and things are harmless \u2013 if the people are available, single, that\u2019s fine. But there are married people, married couples on the ship, who are not always sleeping with their spouse.\u201d Antonucci says this scene wasn\u2019t for him. \u201cI had my group of friends and none of my friends were engaged in that \u2013 although I\u2019d be lying if I said we didn\u2019t have a drink and snicker about it.\u201d Experience of a lifetime Antonucci looks back at his time on The World fondly, but says he wouldn\u2019t purchase another apartment on board. \u201cI had seen what I wanted to see, I was ready to do something new in my life,\u201d he says of the decision to sell in 2019. \u201cI bought a place in Florida and decided to get very aggressive about golf. We have horses. We have a dressage horse and a hunter jumper. It was a time to turn the page in my life, which I try to do every couple of decades and try something new.\u201d Plus, Antonucci says \u201cthe politics, and the gossip on the ship got a little overwhelming.\u201d Antonucci says when residents on board The World first heard about his intentions to write novels about a fictitious residential ship, some told him they were \u201cfrightened\u201d he was about to spill everyone\u2019s secrets. Current and former residents don\u2019t usually speak about their experiences, says Antonucci. \u201cMany people were offended that I would reveal the inner secrets of The World,\u201d he continues. \u201cPeople begged me, \u2018Don\u2019t write anything about us, don\u2019t include us, blah blah blah.\u2019 Then the book came out and of course the people who were so fearful about being portrayed, came to me and said, \u2018How come I\u2019m not in the book?\u2019\u201d Antonucci stresses his novels are fiction and do not include any real people. In a statement provided to CNN Travel, a representative for The World said Antonucci had \u201cassured us in writing that his works are unrelated to The World or its residents, and that his publications are fictional works of art about a fictional ship.\u201d The representative said the ship wishes Antonucci \u201cwell in his creative works of fiction, which we understand have no relation to The World or any of its residents.\u201d Antonucci says that, above all, he\u2019s forever grateful he spent time on board The World. He says the experience shaped his life and his outlook on the actual world. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin whenever people ask me the most incredible thing I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he says. \u201cI could talk about the Solomon Islands. I could tell you how every time we went to South Africa, we would get off and go on a safari for a week. We set a Guinness World Record for being the vessel that traveled furthest south of any vessel in history.\u201d And while Antonucci didn\u2019t always gel with everyone on board, he has good friends from The World to this day. \u201cThose are all very, very special memories,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I got to share them with friends.\u201d", "summary": "It\u2019s a floating city exclusively home to the 1 per cent, a playground for multimillionaires and billionaires that circumnavigates the world's oceans.", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/scandals-and-secrets-on-board-the-world-s-most-exclusive-private-residential-ship-1.6904986", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/29/the-world-ship-1-6904991-1716990808420.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:56:22", "author": "CNN,Francesca Street", "authors": ["CNN", "Francesca Street"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.206}

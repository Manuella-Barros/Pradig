Railway is a service for the common man of this country\".\n\n\"I request this house to focus on strengthening, modernising and improving the operating procedure of railways and depoliticising these issues\" he added.\n\nHe further said, \"I thank members of parliament who suggested constructive suggestions for the development of railways.

Today, they dare to raise the questions.\"\n\n\"When Mamata Banerjee was the railway minister, she used to give the accident numbers that decreased from 0.24 per cent to 0.19 per cent these people used to clap in the House and today when it has decreased from 0.19 per cent to 0.3 per cent, they put such blame. Will this country run in this way?\" he asked.\n\nThe railway minister also accused the opposition of infusing fear in the hearts of those 2 crore people who travel every day by railways.\n\n\"The Congress, which is busy setting up a shop of lies, will not succeed with that shop. Sometimes they belittle the army, sometimes they belittle the railways; this kind of politics will not work,\" he said.\n\n\"Congress with the help of its troll army of social media raises false things. Are they trying to infuse fear in the hearts of those 2 crore people who travel every day by railways?\" he added.\n\nVaishnaw's remarks came after the opposition consistently pressed for the government to hold him accountable for recent train accidents and to dismiss him from his position.\n\nOver the past few months, Union minister Vaishnaw has faced significant online trolling in connection with railway accidents. Many memes have ridiculed him as the \"Reel minister.\"\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

That gave the Knicks a 2-0 lead in the series as it heads back to Indianapolis.\n\n\"I'm just happy I [returned], to be honest with you,\" Brunson said on TNT. \"We found a way. That's it.\"\n\nPacers surge early with Jalen Brunson out\n\nThe Pacers mounted a 17-point swing in the first half after the Knicks lost Brunson in the opening minutes, which nearly resulted in a perfect opportunity to steal a game on the road.\n\nIt appeared as if Brunson tweaked his right foot while on defense late in the first quarter. He took an awkward step while moving into the lane, and then he immediately called for a sub after the Pacers scored.\n\nBrunson left the game after just eight minutes, and went back to the locker room. His father, Knicks assistant coach Rick Brunson, left the bench in the second quarter to go back to the locker room, too, though the team didn't provide an update for quite some time. Eventually, midway through the second quarter, the Knicks said that Brunson was dealing with a sore right foot. He was initially questionable to return, but came back to start the second half to a huge standing ovation in Manhattan.\n\nThe Knicks were up by seven points when Brunson left the floor, though they entered halftime down by 10 points -- which marked a massive 17-point swing for the Pacers. Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton had 22 points in the first half while shooting 7-of-12 from the field, which doubled his shot attempts from Game 1.\n\nKnicks rally with Brunson back\n\nBrunson's return seemed to make all the difference for the Knicks. They took the lead almost instantly in the second half, and came out of the gate on a 21-6 tear. The Knicks held Indiana to just 18 points in the third quarter, 10 of which came in the final four minutes, and took an eight-point lead into the final period -- which completely flipped the game after halftime.\n\nThe Knicks lost O.G. Anunoby to a leg injury in the third quarter, however, after he pulled up awkwardly while driving to the rim. He was quickly ruled out with a left hamstring injury, and finished with 28 points and shot 10-of-19 from the field. It's unclear how severe his injury is, or if he'll be available for Game 3 on Friday night.\n\nThough the Pacers opened the fourth quarter on a quick 6-0 burst, Brunson responded with a massive and-one layup to keep them up by multiple possessions.\n\nThe Knicks then used a 7-0 run, backed off a clutch 3-pointer from Donte DiVincenzo and then a perfect dump from him down to Precious Achiuwa to finally put the Pacers away late in the period. That allowed them to roll to the nine-point win, which gave them a two-game lead in the series.\n\nHaliburton led the Pacers with 34 points, nine assists and six rebounds while shooting 7-of-11 from behind the arc. Andrew Nembhard added 15 points, and Pascal Siakam finished with 14 points and eight rebounds. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the final minute, too, after arguing with officials over a double-dribble call that felt like was frustration boiling over.\n\nBrunson finished with 29 points, all but five of which came in the second half, and five assists while shooting 11-of-18 from the field. DiVincenzo added 28 points, and Josh Hart dropped 19 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nGame 3 of the series is set for Friday night in Indianapolis. While there are plenty of questions surrounding the Knicks' health, both with Brunson and Anunoby, the Knicks are in an incredible position to make their first Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_young@aol.com", "name": "Ryan Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The sixth-seeded Pacers will try to bounce back on Wednesday as the series continues at Madison Square Garden.\n\nKnicks guard Jalen Brunson scored a game-high 43 points in the series opener, but the Pacers entered the fourth quarter with a five-point lead and had chances to win the game late. Myles Turner -- who had a team-high 23 points for Indiana -- was whistled for an illegal screen with 12 seconds left that prevented the Pacers from having the chance to take the lead.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met six times in the playoffs over an eight-year span between 1993 and 2000. The names are different this time around. Instead of Miller and Patrick Ewing, it's Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton. The stakes, however, are just as high. The winner will advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHere's everything you need to know as the Knicks and Pacers continue their renewed rivalry.\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers schedule, scores\n\nAll times Eastern | * If necessary\n\nGame 1: Knicks 121, Pacers 117 -- New York leads 1-0Game 2: Wednesday, May 8 -- Pacers at Knicks, 8:00 p.m., TNTGame 3: Friday, May 10 -- Knicks at Pacers, 7:00 p.m., ESPN/fuboGame 4: Sunday, May 12 -- Knicks at Pacers, 3:30 p.m., ABC/fuboGame 5*: Tuesday, May 14 -- Pacers at KnicksGame 6*: Friday, May 17 -- Knicks at PacersGame 7*: Sunday, May 19 -- Pacers at KnicksKnicks vs. Pacers, Game 2Where to watch\n\nTime: 8 p.m. ET | Date: Wednesday, May 8\n\nLocation: Madison Square Garden -- New York City\n\nTV channel: TNT | Streaming: Watch TNT, Max\n\nStorylines\n\nJalen Brunson is on a historic scoring streak. Brunson scored 43 points in Monday's Game 1 win, and he's now scored at least 40 points in four consecutive playoff games. It puts Brunson in elite company. Only three other NBA playoffs have pulled off this feat: Michael Jordan, the last to do it in 1993, Bernard King and Jerry West, who went for 40 in a record six straight playoff games in 1965. Factor in Brunson's assists and he's in a class of his own. The Knicks star is the first player in NBA history to have at least 40 points and at least five assists in four consecutive playoff games.\n\nAnd the Knicks have needed all his production. New York is 3-1 in those four games, and each one has been decided by six points or less.\n\n\"Yeah, the 40 points are cool and all, but it's the little things that help us win games like that. So I'm just happy to have the group of guys that I do,\" Brunson told reporters after Game 1.\n\nPrediction\n\nOpening series odds: Knicks -265, Pacers +210\n\nSeries odds after Game 1: Knicks -350, Pacers +275\n\nOne of the lessons of Game 1 was that New York has ways of slowing down Indiana's star point guard, but the Pacers have absolutely nothing for the leader of the Knicks. Jalen Brunson may not outscore Tyrese Haliburton by 37 points in every game, but I just have more trust in New York's ability to generate the hard points it will need late to win than I do Indiana's.

The Knicks won 130-121.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Jalen Brunson returned from a right foot injury to score 24 of his 29 points in the second half, leading the New York Knicks to a 130-121 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night for a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nOn the anniversary of Willis Reed's dramatic emergence from the locker room before Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals to lead the Knicks to their first title, Brunson sent the Madison Square Garden crowd into a frenzy when he came out to warm up at halftime after missing the entire second quarter while the Pacers surged ahead to a double-figure lead.\n\nHe fell short of becoming the second player in NBA history to score 40 or more points in five straight playoff games, but he gave the Knicks everything they needed to move halfway to their first Eastern Conference finals appearance since 2000.\n\n\"He's a great leader, so I think the players all have respect for that, when a guy goes out and is willing to give whatever he has, and so that says a lot about him,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said.\n\nOG Anunoby added a career playoff-high 28 points before leaving with a left hamstring injury in the third quarter for the injury-riddled Knicks, who have already lost three key players to season-ending injuries.\n\nBut they got Brunson back and received huge efforts again from his two Villanova teammates. Donte DiVincenzo scored 28 points and Josh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists for the No. 2-seeded Knicks.\n\nTyrese Haliburton rebounded from a poor Game 1 with 34 points, nine assists and six rebounds for the Pacers, who finished the game without coach Rick Carlisle after he got two technical fouls and was ejected.\n\nThe series moves to Indiana for Game 3 on Friday and Game 4 on Sunday.\n\nFormer Knicks forward Obi Toppin added 20 points in another strong effort by Indiana's reserves, but the Pacers hurt themselves by shooting just 10 for 17 (59%) from the free throw line.\n\nKnicks fans jeered Pacers Hall of Famer Reggie Miller, an enemy from the heated 1990s era of this playoff rivalry who was calling the game as part of TNT's crew, during a delirious finish to what had been a nervous first half, when Brunson was missing for the entire second quarter.\n\nHe had made a 3-pointer for a 24-13 lead in the first quarter, giving the Knicks 10 baskets in their first 14 shots in a blistering start. But after Toppin made one for the Pacers on the other end, Brunson began waving to the bench for a substitution as he ran down the court on offense. That was early in an 11-0 run by Indiana to tie it, and it was tied again at 36 after Toppin made three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers then made 15 of 22 shots in the second quarter in Brunson's absence, outscoring the Knicks 37-27 to take a 73-63 lead.\n\nBrunson emerged during the half to warm up, triggering a huge roar from the fans who weren't in concession lines or restrooms, followed by \"MVP! MVP!\" chants. Indiana's lead was 79-70 before the Knicks stormed ahead with a 14-0 run, with Brunson contributing a three-point play during it as New York went ahead 84-79.\n\nAnunoby was hurt soon after, appearing to injure his hamstring while trying to finish a fast-break layup, but Brunson guided the Knicks through the finish with 14 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith All-Star Julius Randle gone to shoulder surgery and key reserves Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic lost in the playoffs, the Knicks have been relying on their starters to play major minutes -- all 48 of them for Hart in both games of the series.\n\nSo they can't afford to play without Brunson, who finished fifth in the voting for MVP that Nikola Jokic won Wednesday.\n\nHe had joined Jerry West, Michael Jordan and Bernard King as the only players with at least four straight 40-point games in the playoffs, and came in as the leading scorer in the postseason with 36.6 points per game.\n\nBrunson ended up getting fairly close to that despite playing only 32 minutes.\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein finished with 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists for the Knicks, forced to play 39 minutes after the Knicks announced Tuesday that Robinson would miss at least six weeks with a stress injury to his left ankle.\n\nThe Knicks paid tribute Reed's return, one of the most memorable moments in NBA and Madison Square Garden, during the first quarter. His No. 19 jersey, hanging in the rafters, was spotlighted, and Hall of Fame teammate Walt Frazier came onto the court for an ovation.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri":

That was early in an 11-0 run by Indiana to tie it, and it was tied again at 36 after Toppin made three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers then made 15 of 22 shots in the second quarter in Brunson's absence, outscoring the Knicks 37-27 to take a 73-63 lead.\n\nBrunson would only say he felt some discomfort and that once he warmed up, he knew he was going back into the game.\n\n\"I had a decision to make and I made a decision,\" Brunson said.\n\nIndiana's lead was 79-70 before the Knicks stormed ahead with a 14-0 run, with Brunson contributing a three-point play during it as New York went ahead 84-79.\n\nAnunoby was hurt soon after, appearing to injure his hamstring while trying to finish a fast-break layup, but Brunson guided the Knicks through the finish with 14 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith All-Star Julius Randle gone to shoulder surgery and key reserves Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic lost in the playoffs, the Knicks have been relying on their starters to play major minutes -- all 48 of them for Hart in both games of the series.\n\nSo they can't afford to play without Brunson, who finished fifth in the voting for MVP that Nikola Jokic won Wednesday.\n\nHe had joined Jerry West, Michael Jordan and Bernard King as the only players with at least four straight 40-point games in the playoffs, and came in as the leading scorer in the postseason with 36.6 points per game.\n\nBrunson ended up getting fairly close to that despite playing only 32 minutes, saying afterward that teammates were teasing him with Reed jokes.\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein finished with 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists for the Knicks, forced to play 39 minutes after the Knicks announced Tuesday that Robinson would miss at least six weeks with a stress injury to his left ankle.\n\nThe Knicks paid tribute to Reed's return, one of the most memorable moments in NBA and Madison Square Garden history, during the first quarter. His No. 19 jersey, hanging in the rafters, was spotlighted, and Hall of Fame teammate Walt Frazier came onto the court for an ovation.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Brunson's injury doesn't appaer to be serious, which is good news for a Knicks team that's been hit hard by injuries. The Knicks vs. Pacers series will now head to Indiana for Games 3 and 4 and Brunson will remain the biggest difference maker on the floor.\n\nWillis Reed running up the tunnel and returning to Game 7 of the 1970s NBA Finals from injury is arguably the most iconic moment in New York Knicks history. The best player on the team returns to a playoff game and helps carry the team to victory. On Tuesday night, the current best player on the Knicks had his own Willis Reed moment and sparked his team to a Game 2 victory.\n\nJalen Brunson, injured in the first quarter of the game, came back out at halftime and led the Knicks to a dominant second-half performance in a 130-121 victory in Game 2 of the Eastern Conferene Semifinals. The Knicks now lead the Indiana Pacers in the best-of-seven series two games to none.\n\nBrunson, who had been on a scoring blitz the past five games, scored 24 points in the second half and finished with a team-high 29 points. Brunson was hobbled in the first quarter with a foot injury and immediately pulled himself out of the game and sat out the second quarter. But his return wasn't a shock to his coach, Tom Thibodeau.\n\n\"The mental toughness piece is so important. The ability to get through things. To be at your best when your best is needed, even when you may not be feeling your best. That's who he is. Great leader.\" - Tom Thibodeau on Jalen Brunson\n\nBrunson's Impact on the Game Pacers dominated while he was out\n\nBrunson has been the best player for the Knicks all season and the playoffs have proven to be no different. But when he had to go out with a foot injury, the Pacers took advantage. Indiana outscored the Knicks by 10 in the second quarter to take a 10-point lead into halftime. The Pacers were led by Tyrese Haliburton's 22 first-half points.\n\nBut once Brunson returned, the Knicks came to life. New York dominated the third quarter, outscoring the Pacers 36-18 in the period. OG Anunoby had his highest scoring output as a Knick, pouring in 28 points. Donte DiVincenzo also scored 28 and Josh Hart, who played all 48 minutes again, added 19 points and 15 rebounds. Isaiah Hartenstein nearly had a triple-double with 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists.\n\nBrunson led the charge in the fourth quarter, effectively working as the closer once again for the Knicks. He looked like he didn't miss a step, driving and pulling up for floaters and mid-range jumpers when the Knicks needed a bucket. He scored 14 points in the fourth to put away the game.\n\n\"A lot of toughness. We know that's his makeup, but that's also the makeup of our team.\" -Tom Thibodeau on Jalen Brunson\n\nHow Can the Knicks Battle Against Injuries Anunoby left and didn't return\n\nWhile Brunson was able to return and help lead the Knicks to the victory, another one of the Knicks players left the game and didn't return. Anunoby left with a hamstring injury and there was no update on his status immediately following the game. Brunson and Anunoby's injuries are just more of a slew that the Knicks have suffered this season.\n\nThe Knicks have been without Julius Randle since January and they have lost Bojan Bogdanovich and Mitchell Robinson during the playoffs. Players like Precious Achiuwa, Miles McBride, and Alec Burks saw increased minutes on Wednesday.\n\nIf Anunoby can't go in Game 3, it will be interesting to see what lineup Thibodeau plays. As long as Brunson is in it, the Knicks have a definite shot at winning.\n\nRelated Knicks' Mitchell Robinson Pledges to 'Seek Revenge' For Injury Mitchell Robinson is said to be out 6-8 weeks and the New York Knicks big man took to social media after the news.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-03-may-2024-01-04-am-3807.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

That gave the Knicks a 2-0 lead in the series as it heads back to Indianapolis.\n\nThe Pacers mounted a 17-point swing in the first half after the Knicks lost Brunson in the opening minutes, which nearly resulted in a perfect opportunity to steal a game on the road.\n\nIt appeared as if Brunson tweaked his right foot while on defense late in the first quarter. He took an awkward step while moving into the lane, and then he immediately called for a sub after the Pacers scored.\n\nBrunson left the game after just eight minutes, and went back to the locker room. His father, Knicks assistant coach Rick Brunson, left the bench in the second quarter to go back to the locker room, too, though the team didn't provide an update for quite some time. Eventually, midway through the second quarter, the Knicks said that Brunson was dealing with a sore right foot. He was initially questionable to return, but came back to start the second half to a huge standing ovation in Manhattan.\n\nThe Knicks were up by seven points when Brunson left the floor, though they entered halftime down by 10 points -- which marked a massive 17-point swing for the Pacers. Haliburton had 22 points in the first half while shooting 7-of-12 from the field, which doubled his shot attempts from Game 1.\n\nBrunson's return seemed to make all the difference for the Knicks. They took the lead almost instantly in the second half, and came out of the gate on a 21-6 tear. The Knicks held Indiana to just 18 points in the third quarter, 10 of which came in the final four minutes, and took an eight-point lead into the final period -- which completely flipped the game after halftime.\n\nThe Knicks lost O.G. Anunoby to a leg injury in the third quarter, however, after he pulled up awkwardly while driving to the rim. He was quickly ruled out with a left hamstring injury, and finished with 28 points and shot 10-of-19 from the field.\n\nThough the Pacers opened the fourth quarter on a quick 6-0 burst, Brunson responded with a massive and-one layup to keep them up by multiple possessions.\n\nThe Knicks then used a 7-0 run, backed off a clutch 3-pointer from Donte DiVincenzo and then a perfect dump from him down to Precious Achiuwa to finally put the Pacers away late in the period. That allowed them to roll to the nine-point win, which gave them a two-game lead in the series.\n\nHaliburton led the Pacers with 34 points, nine assists and six rebounds while shooting 7-of-11 from behind the arc. Andrew Nembhard added 15 points, and Pascal Siakam finished with 14 points and eight rebounds. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected in the final minute, too, after arguing with officials over a double-dribble call that felt like was frustration boiling over.\n\nBrunson finished with 29 points, all but five of which came in the second half, and five assists while shooting 11-of-18 from the field.

That was early in an 11-0 run by Indiana to tie it, and it was tied again at 36 after Toppin made three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers then made 15 of 22 shots in the second quarter in Brunson's absence, outscoring the Knicks 37-27 to take a 73-63 lead.\n\nBrunson emerged during the half to warm up, triggering a huge roar from the fans who weren't in concession lines or restrooms, followed by \"MVP! MVP!\" chants. Indiana's lead was 79-70 before the Knicks stormed ahead with a 14-0 run, with Brunson contributing a three-point play during it as New York went ahead 84-79.\n\nAnunoby was hurt soon after, appearing to injure his hamstring while trying to finish a fast-break layup, but Brunson guided the Knicks through the finish with 14 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Knicks paid tribute Reed's return, one of the most memorable moments in NBA and Madison Square Garden, during the first quarter. His No. 19 jersey, hanging in the rafters, was spotlighted, and Hall of Fame teammate Walt Frazier came onto the court for an ovation.", "source": {"uri": "recordherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The Knicks took game one -- they were slightly better at the little things and pushed through an odd ending.\n\nNew York lost Mitchell Robison between the first and second game, and their thin depth was already a story entering the series. But the Pacers have struggled against the Knicks starting lineup, which made depth less important. Indiana needed its opening five to be better in Game 2.\n\nThey started off the game up 4-3 thanks to two baskets at the rim, but it was a back-and-forth affair early. Neither team was stringing together stops or baskets, so the score remained close for the first few minutes.\n\nIndiana mixed up their matchups. Andrew Nembhard started the game guarding Knicks star Jalen Brunson, but after a few minutes, Aaron Nesmith took the assignment. Brunson had just two of New York's first 13 points -- it was a much slower start for him than he had in Game 1. But it was still 13-10 Knicks at the time.\n\nOG Anunoby was shining for the hosts early. He was driving to the rim with ease and hitting outside shots -- and he had 10 of New York's first 18 points. That helped the Knicks race ahead and end the trading baskets stage of the game -- they took a 24-13 lead with 4:01 to go in the first quarter, and the Pacers took a timeout.\n\nThat stoppage did wonders for the blue and gold. They went on an 11-0 run that spanned a 49 second period, and they tied the game up at 24. That stretch was needed after a dismal start, but the Pacers were back in the game.\n\nThey were able to take the lead again, but the Knicks grabbed it right back. After one quarter, the score was tied at 36. Tyrese Haliburton led the Pacers with 13 points while Anunoby's 12 points paced the Knicks.\n\nTo get the second quarter going, the two teams were trading buckets once again. New York held the lead after some free throws, then Indiana took it back thanks to a three-point play from Isaiah Jackson. It was a high-speed, intense battle through 15 minutes.\n\nA larger Indiana unit with all of Pascal Siakam, Obi Toppin, and Isaiah Jackson helped the Pacers push ahead and grab a six-point lead, though they were playing against a Knicks group that had Brunson on the bench. The star guard sat for a few minutes to start the second period.\n\nThe Knicks announced soon after that Brunson had a sore right foot and was questionable to return. His absence was massive for Indiana, and the Pacers needed to take advantage.\n\nWith the star guard out, the visitors kept pushing ahead. Their passing was sublime thanks to T.J. McConnell and Haliburton, and three-point shots were falling at a high rate. Haliburton dropped in an outside shot with 3:03 to go until halftime and it put the Pacers up by 10. That led to a New York timeout.\n\nIndiana's offense never cooled off as they continued to attack the rim and generate good shots down the stretch of the first half. Their lead stayed close to 10 for most of that period, and they never let up from their style.\n\nThey carried that edge into halftime. At the break, it was 73-63 in favor of the Pacers. Haliburton's 22 points and five assists led the team. Their outside shooting was vital in the first half -- the Knicks shot over 58% from the field through two periods, but the Pacers were still up double figures.\n\nTo kick off the second half, both teams were rolling on offense. Donte DiVincenzo was knocking down shots left and right for the Knicks, but Nembhard had answers. On the whole, DiVincenzo was the superior talent in those moments, and the Knicks cut the lead down to five quickly.\n\nBrunson returned to the game to start the second half, and he quickly found a role in the game on both ends. He scored a few times early in the third quarter, and New York tied the game at 79 not long after. The Pacers first half advantage was gone.\n\nIn total, the Knicks scored on nine out of 10 possessions, and they claimed an 84-79 edge. It was a brutal run for Indiana, who lost all the momentum they acquired before halftime. They took a timeout when their deficit reached five.\n\nNew York's relentless style continued. They kept pushing and expanded their lead to seven just a few moments later, and then up to nine. Their defensive pressure was leading to errors, and their offense was playing nearly perfect. The Pacers couldn't keep up.\n\nLate in the period, Indiana cut the lead down to three. But the Knicks responded with a quick five points from Brunson to expand the lead to eight, and they led 99-91 entering the final period. Brunson was up to 15 points while Anunoby had 28, but Anunoby left the game in the third quarter with an injury. The third quarter was 36-18 in favor of New York.\n\nThe fourth quarter started with six-straight points from the Pacers, a run that they badly needed. Brunson answered with a three-point play, but Indiana had a rhythm, and they needed to hold it. Their big bench group was playing well.\n\nA few minutes later, they cut the Knicks advantage to one at 102-101. McConnell was playing well for the Pacers, who were on a 10-3 run. With Anunoby out, their bigger lineup was having success, but they still had work to do. There was a timeout with 8:02 to go.\n\nNew York did well, largely thanks to timely shots from Brunson and Josh Hart, to cling to their lead. It was 110-108 with 5:30 to go, and even the Knicks' broken possessions were ending with decent shots. Indiana was going to need to find another level in the final minutes.\n\nEvery time the Pacers would score and cut the Knicks edge to one possession, the hosts would answer with a huge shot that got the crowd involved in the action. It happened again with about four minutes to go as DiVincenzo hit a three to expand New York's lead to five.\n\nTheir advantage reached seven with about 3.5 minutes to go. The Pacers were running out of time to make a run, and they were struggling to get enough stops to make a comeback. Their defense wasn't good enough in the fourth quarter of Game 1, and it looked the same in the second half of Game 2.\n\nNew York's lead reached nine in the final 90 seconds of play, which put Indiana's chances on life support. They needed to be perfect the rest of the way to make a comeback. Nesmith hit a three to cut the lead to six, but the Pacers needed some stops.\n\nThey forced two missed shots, but the Knicks tracked down two offensive rebounds. The hosts held the ball with 53 seconds left and the advantage. They scored on the possession to take an eight-point lead and all but bury the Pacers.\n\nA few moments later, Carlisle was irate at the officials. He was unhappy with an inadvertent whistle call, and he never let up. He was ejected with 33.9 seconds to go, but the Knicks were up 10 at the time.\n\nNew York held on to win 130-121. They took a 2-0 series lead, with the next two games coming in Indianapolis on Friday and Sunday.\n\nBrunson finished with 29 points. Haliburton had 34 points and nine assists. Toppin added 20 for Indiana.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The Knicks won Wednesday's Game 2, 130-121, in a matchup that saw their star player miss more than a quarter with an injury. Jalen Brunson missed the final 15 minutes of the first half with a sore right foot, but he returned at the start of the third quarter and helped spark a rally that put the Knicks ahead.\n\nBrunson ended with 29 points, and 24 of them came after he returned from the injury. His floater with 41.7 seconds left served as a knockout blow to the Pacers. The Knicks were outscored by 17 points as he spent the end of the first quarter and the entire second quarter in the locker room. But New York won the third quarter, 36-18, and hung on for the victory in another nail-biting fourth quarter.\n\nOG Anunoby had 28 points for the Knicks, but he left the game in the third quarter with a hamstring injury and did not return. Donte DiVincenzo added 28 points and hit half of his 12 3-point attempts.\n\nThe Pacers led by 10 points at halftime, but struggled in the third quarter. Tyrese Haliburton was much more assertive after scoring just six points in Game 1, though it wasn't enough in the end. He had 34 points, but 22 of them came in the first half and he scored just two points in the third quarter.\n\nHere are three takeaways from Wednesday night's wild game.\n\nIt didn't quite summon all the drama of the original, but Brunson's return in the second half on Wednesday night mirrored one of the most iconic moments in Knicks history: When Willis Reed emerged from the locker room on a bad leg to help lead the Knicks to their first championship in 1970. Coincidentally, Wednesday was also the 54th anniversary -- to the day -- of Reed's heroics. Eerie stuff.\n\nAs for Brunson, we're getting spoiled by what he's been able to do during these playoffs, as he ran roughshod over the Pacers after his return, scoring 24 of his 29 points in the second half. He was simply unstoppable getting to his spots no matter which defender Indiana threw at him.\n\nWhen the Pacers trapped Brunson to force the ball out of his hands, he didn't force the issue, instead making the simple pass and allowing his supporting cast to play four-on-three behind him.\n\nBrunson has been phenomenal for the Knicks all season long, and Game 2 only added to his growing legend.\n\nBrunson was able to gut it out to finish Game 2, but we'll have to see how his injured foot responds ahead of Friday's Game 3 in Indiana. The Pacers outscored the Knicks by 17 points when Brunson was out, in keeping with the trend we've seen all postseason. The Knicks need their leader at somewhere close to full strength to function effectively, and foot injuries can sometimes be tricky.\n\nAnunoby's issue seems more concerning, at least for now. Hamstrings are notoriously difficult injuries that tend to recur if not given adequate rest. With just one day off before Game 3, it's going to take some significant treatment and improvement for Anunoby to be able to play.\n\nIf he's sidelined, that would mean the Knicks would be without three of their major frontcourt pieces (Anunoby, Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson) as they attempt to take a commanding 3-0 lead in the series. Tom Thibodeau is known for trimming his playoff rotation to the bare minimum, but someone -- Miles McBride, Precious Achiuwa, maybe even Alec Burks -- is going to get significant run if Brunson and/or Anunoby are out or hindered.\n\nAfter putting up just six points on four shots in Game 1, Haliburton clearly came out on a mission to look for his own offense in Game 2. The spindly guard logged 22 points on 7-for-12 shooting in the first half as the Pacers built a 10-point lead.\n\nThe second half was a different story, however, as he scored just two points on two shots in the third quarter while the Knicks mounted their swift comeback. He had a decent fourth quarter, scoring 10 points on five shots, but he definitely looked to be in pass-first mode much of the time -- which the Knicks anticipated and ate up.\n\nIf the Pacers are going to come back in this series, they're going to need the Haliburton from the first half for the entire time he's out there. It's not fair to ask him to score 40-plus every night -- that's just not in his arsenal right now -- but putting pressure on the defense as a scorer opens up everything else for his team.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_ward_henninger@cbssports.com", "name": "Colin Ward-Henninger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Donte DiVincenzo scored 28 points and Josh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists for the No. 2-seeded Knicks.\n\nTyrese Haliburton rebounded from a poor Game 1 with 34 points, nine assists and six rebounds for the Pacers, who finished the game without coach Rick Carlisle after he got two technical fouls and was ejected.\n\nThe series moves to Indiana for Game 3 on Friday and Game 4 on Sunday.\n\nFormer Knicks forward Obi Toppin added 20 points in another strong effort by Indiana's reserves, but the Pacers hurt themselves by shooting just 10 for 17 (59%) from the free throw line.\n\nKnicks fans jeered Pacers Hall of Famer Reggie Miller, an enemy from the heated 1990s era of this playoff rivalry who was calling the game as part of TNT's crew, during a delirious finish to what had been a nervous first half, when Brunson was missing for the entire second quarter.\n\nHe had made a 3-pointer for a 24-13 lead in the first quarter, but after Toppin made one for the Pacers on the other end, Brunson began waving to the bench for a substitution as he ran down the court on offense. That was early in an 11-0 run by Indiana to tie it, and it was tied again at 36 after Toppin made three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers then made 15 of 22 shots in the second quarter in Brunson's absence, outscoring the Knicks 37-27 to take a 73-63 lead.\n\nBrunson emerged during the half to warm up, triggering a huge roar from the fans who weren't in concession lines or restrooms, followed by \"MVP! MVP!\" chants. Indiana's lead was 79-70 before the Knicks stormed ahead with a 14-0 run, with Brunson contributing a three-point play during it as New York went ahead 84-79.\n\nAnunoby was hurt soon after, appearing to injure his hamstring while trying to finish a fast-break layup, but Brunson guided the Knicks through the finish with 14 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Knicks paid tribute Reed's return, one of the most memorable moments in NBA and Madison Square Garden, during the first quarter. His No. 19 jersey, hanging in the rafters, was spotlighted, and Hall of Fame teammate Walt Frazier came onto the court for an ovation.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But series is far from over.", "body": "The Knicks and Pacers have plenty of postseason history but we're here to break down how the two current teams stack up.\n\nFifty-four years ago, on May 8, 1970, New York Knicks star Willis Reed hobbled onto the Madison Square Garden court against the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\n\nIt was the inspiration the Knicks needed to defeat the Lakers and win the franchise's first championship. It is a moment embedded in NBA history.\n\nOn May 8, 2024, Knicks All-Star guard Jalen Brunson returned from an injury in the second half against the Indiana Pacers in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series. Certainly not as dramatic as Reed's return and the stakes were not even close to the same, but Brunson gave the Knicks a necessary lift and helped them to a 130-121 victory and a 2-0 series lead.\n\nThe Pacers blew an opportunity to even the series. The Knicks are battered, depleted, and with a short rotation, the minutes are piling up. Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson are out for the Knicks, and OG Anunoby, who had 28 points in Game 2, didn't play the final 15 minutes due to a sore left hamstring. The Knicks' rotation is down to seven players who are logging heavy minutes, including the Villanova 3 - Brunson, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\nThe series isn't over. Let's see what happens when the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 and Game 4 and who is available for the Knicks.\n\nBut it's difficult for a team to win four of the next five games, and that's the prospect the Pacers face.\n\nEven with everything the Knicks have going on, they have been impressive, and Brunson is the playoff MVP in the East.\n\nNew York's fourth-quarter offensive execution has propelled it to this point - just two victories from reaching its first conference finals since 2000. Entering Game 2 against Indiana, the Knicks had the second-best fourth-quarter offensive rating in the playoffs, scoring 127 points per 100 possessions, just behind Dallas' 127.1.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Knicks used a 36-18 third quarter to erase a 73-63 halftime deficit and take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.\n\nAccording to NBA.com, the Knicks improved to 4-1 in the playoffs in \"clutch\" games - contests where the score was within five points in the final five minutes of regulation and overtime. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, the Knicks made timely shots when the Pacers got within six points or fewer. DiVincenzo made a 3-pointer that extended the Knicks' lead to 124-115, and Brunson made it 126-118 on a short jumper late in the fourth.\n\nHart had 19 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block in 48 minutes, DiVincenzo had 28 points, six rebounds and four assists in nearly 44 minutes and Isaiah Hartenstein added 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in 39 minutes. Had Brunson not left the game for a large portion of the first half, he would've logged 40-plus minutes. As it was, he played the entire second half and finished with 29 points, including 14 in the fourth quarter.\n\nIt's way too early to call the Knicks a team of destiny. If they advance, they likely will face the top-seeded Boston Celtics in the conference finals. They will be underdogs in that series. But there's no denying what a treat Brunson and the Knicks have been so far in the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Indiana is trying to even the series on Wednesday.\n\nA potentially pivotal moment in the game happened in the first quarter Wednesday night when Jalen Brunson exited the game with what the Knicks called a sore right foot. He was deemed questionable to return. But after missing the entire second quarter, Brunson was on the court for the Knicks to start the second half. The Knicks were up by seven when Brunson -- who entered the game having scored 40 or more points in four straight playoff games -- initially went to the locker room.

Another option is Sling TV, which has promotional pricing for new customers.\n\nMax (formerly HBO Max) subscribers can also get the game with the B/R Sports add-on.\n\nThe Pacers are smarting after being on the wrong end of two controversial calls in the final minute of their nailbiting 121-117 loss to the Knicks in Game 1 on Monday. In fact, the officials admitted to making a mistake on one of the calls, when they whistled Pacers guard Aaron Nesmith for a kicked ball violation, nullifying a steal and giving possession back to the Knicks with the score tied. Forty seconds later, Knicks sharpshooter Donte DiVincenzo sunk a three-pointer to put his team up for good.\n\nBut for Indiana to stand a chance in Game 2, they'll need to find an answer for New York guard Jalen Brunson, who has scored over 40 points in his last four playoff games.

Game 3 is scheduled for Friday night in Indianapolis.\n\nBrunson missed the final 15:32 of the first half with a right foot injury. The Knicks led 24-17 when Brunson exited, but they entered the second half down 73-63.\n\nBrunson drew a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden after leading the Knicks out for warmups prior to the third quarter. He played all 24 second-half minutes and had 24 of his team-high 29 points -- along with four assists, two steals and one rebound -- over the final two quarters as New York outscored the Pacers 67-48.\n\n\"Lot of toughness,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said of Brunson. \"That's sort of, I think, the makeup -- we know that's his makeup, but that's also the makeup of our team.\n\n\"The mental-toughness piece is so important -- the ability to get through things, to be at your best when your best is needed even when you may not be feeling your best. And that's who he is. Great leader.\"\n\nNew York's OG Anunoby scored 28 points before leaving with 3:27 left in the third quarter due to a left hamstring injury. The Knicks are already playing without Mitchell Robinson, who will miss at least six weeks after aggravating a left ankle injury in Game 1, and Julius Randle, who is out for the season with a right shoulder injury sustained in January.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo also had 28 points while Josh Hart (19 points, 15 rebounds) and Isaiah Hartenstein (14 points, 12 rebounds) posted double-doubles for the Knicks, who played the final 8:01 without making a substitution.\n\nTyrese Haliburton had 34 points and nine assists for the Pacers, while Obi Toppin scored 20 points off the bench. Andrew Nembhard had 15 points, Pascal Siakam added 14 points and nine rebounds and T.J. McConnell had a double-double (10 points, 12 assists) off the bench.\n\n\"We need to get home. We need to play better,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\nNembhard opened the third quarter with a layup for the Pacers before New York went on a 36-16 run to end the period with a 99-91 lead. Indiana scored the first six points of the fourth to begin a 10-3 run that ended with McConnell hitting a layup with 8:03 left to cut the Pacers' deficit to 102-101.\n\nHart hit a 3-pointer and Indiana got within two points four more times, the last coming at 112-110 on a floater by Haliburton with 4:35 remaining.

But series is far from over.", "body": "It was the inspiration the Knicks needed to defeat the Lakers and win the franchise's first championship. It is a moment embedded in NBA history.\n\nOn May 8, 2024, Knicks All-Star guard Jalen Brunson returned from an injury in the second half against the Indiana Pacers in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series. Certainly not as dramatic as Reed's return and the stakes were not even close to the same, but Brunson gave the Knicks a necessary lift and helped them to a 130-121 victory and a 2-0 series lead.\n\nThe Pacers blew an opportunity to even the series. The Knicks are battered, depleted, and with a short rotation, the minutes are piling up. Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson are out for the Knicks, and OG Anunoby, who had 28 points in Game 2, didn't play the final 15 minutes due to a sore left hamstring. The Knicks' rotation is down to seven players who are logging heavy minutes, including the Villanova 3 - Brunson, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\nThe series isn't over. Let's see what happens when the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 and Game 4 and who is available for the Knicks.\n\nBut it's difficult for a team to win four of the next five games, and that's the prospect the Pacers face.\n\nEven with everything the Knicks have going on, they have been impressive, and Brunson is the playoff MVP in the East.\n\nNew York's fourth-quarter offensive execution has propelled it to this point - just two victories from reaching its first conference finals since 2000. Entering Game 2 against Indiana, the Knicks had the second-best fourth-quarter offensive rating in the playoffs, scoring 127 points per 100 possessions, just behind Dallas' 127.1.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Knicks used a 36-18 third quarter to erase a 73-63 halftime deficit and take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.\n\nAccording to NBA.com, the Knicks improved to 4-1 in the playoffs in \"clutch\" games - contests where the score was within five points in the final five minutes of regulation and overtime. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, the Knicks made timely shots when the Pacers got within six points or fewer. DiVincenzo made a 3-pointer that extended the Knicks' lead to 124-115, and Brunson made it 126-118 on a short jumper late in the fourth.\n\nHart had 19 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block in 48 minutes, DiVincenzo had 28 points, six rebounds and four assists in nearly 44 minutes and Isaiah Hartenstein added 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in 39 minutes. Had Brunson not left the game for a large portion of the first half, he would've logged 40-plus minutes. As it was, he played the entire second half and finished with 29 points, including 14 in the fourth quarter.\n\nIt's way too early to call the Knicks a team of destiny. If they advance, they likely will face the top-seeded Boston Celtics in the conference finals. They will be underdogs in that series. But there's no denying what a treat Brunson and the Knicks have been so far in the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_zillgitt@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Jeff Zillgitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.p2QtHEbrme5Q3W1YYngZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/5bd780c1fe91f04862ef43e8a48833e6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Donte DiVincenzo scored 28 points and Josh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists for the No. 2-seeded Knicks.\n\nTyrese Haliburton rebounded from a poor Game 1 with 34 points, nine assists and six rebounds for the Pacers, who finished the game without coach Rick Carlisle after he got two technical fouls and was ejected.\n\nThe series moves to Indiana for Game 3 on Friday and Game 4 on Sunday.\n\nFormer Knicks forward Obi Toppin added 20 points in another strong effort by Indiana's reserves, but the Pacers hurt themselves by shooting just 10 for 17 (59 percent) from the free throw line.\n\nKnicks fans jeered Pacers Hall of Famer Reggie Miller, an enemy from the heated 1990s era of this playoff rivalry who was calling the game as part of TNT's crew, during a delirious finish to what had been a nervous first half, when Brunson was missing for the entire second quarter.\n\nHe had made a 3-pointer for a 24-13 lead in the first quarter, but after Toppin made one for the Pacers on the other end, Brunson began waving to the bench for a substitution as he ran down the court on offense. That was early in an 11-0 run by Indiana to tie it, and it was tied again at 36 after Toppin made three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers then made 15 of 22 shots in the second quarter in Brunson's absence, outscoring the Knicks, 37-27, to take a 73-63 lead.\n\nBrunson emerged during the half to warm up, triggering a huge roar from the fans who weren't in concession lines or restrooms, followed by \"MVP! MVP!\" chants.

But he was still the hero, returning from a foot injury to score several big buckets down the stretch of his team's 130-121 victory over the Indiana Pacers at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday.\n\nThe Knicks have now trailed six of their eight playoff games by double digits, and they've won five of those six. Seven of their eight games have been within five points in the last five minutes, they're playing a short rotation (that gets shorter every day) and they keep finding ways to win.\n\nHere are some notes, quotes, numbers and film as the Knicks took a 2-0 series lead.\n\n1. Brunson returns and burns the Pacers\n\nThe Knicks have been without Julius Randle since late January and without Bojan Bogdanovic since Game 4 of the first round. On Tuesday, they announced that Mitchell Robinson is out 6-8 weeks with continuing issues in his left ankle.\n\nThey were only playing seven guys on Wednesday, but two more went down with injuries. Feeling pain in his left foot, Brunson checked out with 3:32 left in the first quarter and with the Knicks up seven.\n\nWith their star in the locker room for the rest of the first half, the Knicks' lead disappeared and they trailed by seven at halftime.\n\nThe reaction wasn't quite like that for Willis Reed before Game 7 of the 1970 Finals, but when Brunson walked out on to the floor before the third quarter and shot jumpers under the watchful eye of Knicks trainer Anthony Goenaga, he heard \"MVP\" chants from the Garden crowd.\n\n\"This place has been nothing but special for me,\" Brunson said when asked about the reaction. \"I appreciate everything they do. It was really cool to hear, but I just knew I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was gonna attack the second half.\"\n\nWhile he seemed to defer to his teammates a bit early in the third quarter, Brunson scored 24 points in those 24 second-half minutes.\n\nHe was pressured by T.J. McConnell, and he answered the challenge:\n\nHe was forced into late-clock situations and came up with big, one-on-one buckets:\n\nThe Pacers ran double-teams at him, he made the right plays and the Knicks got great shots:\n\nBrunson's 32 1/2 minutes were (obviously) the fewest he's played in the postseason. But he made the most of them.\n\n\"The mental toughness piece is so important,\" Thibodeau said of his point guard. \"The ability to get through things, to be at your best when your best is needed, even when you may not be feeling your best. That's who he is. He's a great leader.\"\n\n2. Anunoby goes down as Knicks' attrition continues\n\nThough Brunson played the entire second half, the Knicks' injury issues were not over. Late in the third quarter, OG Anunoby hobbled off the floor, missing the final 15 1/2 minutes of the game with a sore left hamstring.\n\nPrecious Achiuwa started the day as the back-up center with Robinson out, and he finished it as the starting power forward alongside Isaiah Hartenstein.\n\nWhen both Anunoby and Randle were hurt in late January, Thibodeau initially went to a starting lineup with that frontline. But the Knicks were outscored by 2.7 points per 100 possessions in 342 regular-season minutes with Achiuwa and Hartenstein on the floor together. And Achiuwa was eventually replaced by Miles McBride in the starting lineup.\n\nIf Anunoby is unavailable for Game 3 on Friday (Thibodeau didn't have an update on him after Game 2), Thibodeau will have a decision to make and he'll likely have to go deeper in his rotation. Alec Burks was dusted off for 44 seconds when Brunson was in the locker room on Wednesday.\n\n3. These are not the '90s Knicks and Pacers\n\nThese two teams faced each other in the playoffs six times in an eight-year stretch from 1993-2000. In those 2000 playoffs, the Knicks' most efficient offensive performance was 98 points on 88 possessions (111 per 100).\n\nOn Wednesday, the Knicks scored 130 points on 92 possessions (141 per 100), the most efficient performance for any team in the last two postseasons.\n\nBrunson's biggest impact obviously comes on the offensive end of the floor, but offense wasn't the problem as the Knicks were outscored by 14 points in those 15 1/2 minutes he was in the locker room. The problem was that they were getting torched on the other end of the floor, with the Pacers finishing the half with 73 points on 49 possessions (149 per 100).\n\nThe Knicks didn't exactly turn into the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second half, but they got just enough stops to pull out the victory. There was a great defensive possession in the third quarter when their rotations were sharp and Anunoby blocked an Aaron Nesmith layup attempt. And with the Knicks up two midway through the fourth, Donte DiVincenzo made a great effort to deflect a Tyrese Haliburton pass.\n\nThe Pacers and Knicks now rank first and third in offensive efficiency in these playoffs, both having scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions over their eight games.\n\n\"I don't really care if it's high-scoring, low-scoring, medium-scoring,\" Thibodeau said. \"The bottom line is you gotta find a way to win. That's the most important thing and you can win games a lot of different ways. We know we're not going to be able to shoot the ball like that every night, so when we're not, we got to be able to win with our defense, our rebounding, our hustle.\n\n4. Haliburton breaks out on offense, breaks down on defense\n\nThe biggest reason the Pacers had their second-most efficient performance of the playoffs was Haliburton recovering from a tough Game 1. Two nights after scoring just six points (his third-lowest output of the season), the All-Star led all scorers with 34 on 11-for-19 shooting, including 7-for-11 from 3-point range.\n\nSeven of his 11 buckets were assisted as the Knicks continue to have trouble keeping up with the Pacers' ball and player movement.\n\nIt was the Haliburton from the first half of the season (his highest-scoring game since Nov. 30), before hamstring and back issues affected his production.\n\n\"Tyrese is a great competitor,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said afterward. \"He responds to all kinds of challenges like this, time and time again over the last two years. I'm proud of his response tonight, but it's not just about one guy breaking out of a scoring thing. It's about all of us. Everybody's just going to have to do more going forward.\"\n\nThey're especially going to have to do more on the other end of the floor, because Game 2 was also a look back at the Pacers' defense from the first half of the season, before the addition of Pascal Siakam gave them a little boost. And Haliburton was often the culprit as the Indiana defense broke down.\n\nThe Knicks were often able to get layups off back-door cuts on Wednesday. Some of that was the Pacers just being aggressive defensively, trying to deny on the perimeter.\n\nThe Pacers and their opponents combined to score 119.1 points per 100 possessions in the regular season, the highest combined mark in the league. And it's been higher (120.7) in the playoffs, because the way this team plays elicits high efficiency on both ends of the floor.\n\n5. Pacers' bench continues to play big ... but not late\n\nDespite Haliburton's breakthrough on Wednesday, the Pacers' starting lineup has been outscored by 32 points in its 42 minutes in this series, having allowed the Knicks to score an amazing 116 points on just 79 possessions (147 per 100). The score of the third quarter was 23-8 in favor of New York before Carlisle made his first second-half sub.\n\nBut the Indiana bench has been terrific, with McConnell having totaled 28 points and 15 assists (with just three turnovers) over the two games and Ben Sheppard and Obi Toppin combining to shoot 9-for-15 from 3-point range.\n\nBut Carlisle continues to go back to his starters at the end of these close games. And the Pacers have now allowed the Knicks to score 26 points on 18 clutch possessions.\n\nWe'll see if things change as the series moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday (7 p.m. ET, ESPN).", "source": {"uri": "nba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_schuhmann@nba.com", "name": "John Schuhmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

When he had to leave in the first quarter with a foot injury and was out the rest of the half, the Knicks came apart.\n\nThen Brunson came back, not moving with his typical burst but playing the entire second half, scoring 24 points and sparking the Knicks to a 130-121 Game 2 win.\n\nNew York now leads the series 2-0 as it heads to Indiana for Game 3 on Friday night.\n\nNew York was up seven when things started to look bleak for New York in the first half.

Former Knick Obi Toppin had another strong game in the garden with 20 points.\n\nHowever, what got the Pacers in trouble this game was what has slowed them all season -- they are not a good defensive team. They made a lot of mistakes.\n\nThe Knicks again showed off the mental toughness that has pushed them through these playoffs so far -- when things get tough, they respond and play better.\n\nThat's everything Knicks fans could want in a team.

Donte DiVincenzo scored 28 points and Josh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and 7 assists for the No. 2-seeded Knicks.\n\nTyrese Haliburton rebounded from a poor Game 1 with 34 points, 9 assists and 6 rebounds for the Pacers, who finished the game without Coach Rick Carlisle after he got two technical fouls and was ejected.\n\nThe series moves to Indiana for Game 3 on Friday and Game 4 on Sunday.\n\nFormer Knicks forward Obi Toppin added 20 points in another strong effort by Indiana's reserves, but the Pacers hurt themselves by shooting just 10 for 17 (59%) from the free throw line.\n\nBrunson had made a three-pointer for a 24-13 lead in the first quarter, but after Toppin made one for the Pacers on the other end, Brunson began waving to the bench for a substitution as he ran down the court on offense. That was early in an 11-0 run by Indiana to tie it, and it was tied again at 36 after Toppin made three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Pacers then made 15 of 22 shots in the second quarter in Brunson's absence, outscoring the Knicks 37-27 to take a 73-63 lead.\n\nThe Knicks paid tribute to Reed's return, one of the most memorable moments in NBA and Madison Square Garden history, during the first quarter. His No. 19 jersey, hanging in the rafters, was spotlighted, and Hall of Fame teammate Walt Frazier came onto the court for an ovation.\n\nNew York Knicks' Isaiah Hartenstein (55) celebrates with Donte DiVincenzo (0) during the second half of Game 2 in an NBA basketball second-round playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, Wednesday, May 8, 2024, in New York.

Indiana led by nine points early in the fourth quarter in Game 1 but failed to hold off the Knicks, eventually losing 121-117. Tyrese Haliburton is questionable again for the Pacers due to back spasms but is expected to play.\n\nTom Thibodeau needed his Villanova boys again in the series opener versus Indiana to carry the Knicks home. Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo scored 33 of the team's 39 points in the final 12 minutes to chase down the Pacers. New York will not mind following the same script to grab a stranglehold on the series.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks: Preview, prediction and betting tips\n\nMadison Square Garden will host the rematch between the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks. TNT will air the game as it happens while basketball fans can also stream the action by subscribing to the NBA League Pass.\n\nEditor's Note: The odds could change closer to the game. The odds listed were as per available information at the time of the writing.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks: Game preview\n\nTyrese Haliburton's health has to be a concern for the Indiana Pacers after he was badly outplayed by Jalen Brunson. Maybe his back bothered him so much that he was limited in Game 1.\n\nIf that will be the case again, Myles Turner, Pascal Siakam, Andrew Nembhard and others better step up. They nearly stunned the Knicks in Game 1 due to the impressive work by the three but they will have to replicate their performances to keep the team afloat if Haliburton remains ineffective.\n\nThe New York Knicks bench has to give the starters enough quality minutes to gain a 2-0 series lead. In Game 2, Indiana whipped New York's reserves 46-3, a disparity that almost cost the home team the game. Mitchell Robinson has been ruled out which means that Precious Achiuwa, Miles McBride and probably Alec Burks will be needed to punch their weight.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks: Starting lineups, subs and rotation\n\nPF - Pascal Siakam, C - Myles Turner, SF - Aaron Nesmith, PG - Tyrese Haliburton and PG - Andrew Nembhard will line up for tip-off for the Indiana Pacers.\n\nObi Toppin and T.J. McConnell are likely getting off the bench first to join the starters, considering how they played in the series opener.\n\nSF - O.G. Anunoby, C - Isaiah Hartenstein, PG - Jalen Brunson, SG - Donte DiVincenzo and SG - Josh Hart will again open the game for the New York Knicks.\n\nMiles McBride has to be the first to come off the bench with Mitchell Robinson ruled out. McBride will have to do his share in shadowing Tyrese Haliburton and giving the offense a lift when he's on the court.\n\nEditor's Note: These are predicted starting lineups, which could change depending on the availability of players uncertain to play.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks: Betting tips\n\nJalen Brunson gets a 37.5 over/under points prop in Game 2 on Wednesday. The lefty guard has been on fire, over 40 points in his last four games. Unless he comes crashing back to earth, betting over seems to be more sensible than going under.\n\nPascal Siakam has a 19.5 over/under points prop in the Knicks-Pacers rematch. \"Spicy P\" had 19 points in Game 1 but could have easily gotten more had he not missed some open looks. If Haliburton remains limited, he is likely going over his points prop for the Pacers to win.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks: Prediction\n\nThe Indiana Pacers proved that they are no pushovers in Game 1. They will again push the New York Knicks but might again fall short. Jalen Brunson just seems to be able to will his team to the finish line late in the game. New York will likely go 2-0 and beat Indiana's +4.5 spread in the process.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_macasero@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Michael Macasero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks' Hartenstein.\n\nCarlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" Carlisle said. \"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing. Give New York credit for the physicality that they're playing with.

Game 4 will be Sunday in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Knicks outshot the Pacers 57% to 51.6% in Game 2. They also held a 44-34 edge in rebounding. The game featured 11 lead changes and was tied eight times. The Pacers edged the Knicks 46-12 in points off the bench and led by as many as a dozen points.\n\nBrunson, who entered the night with four-consecutive performances of at least 40 points, helped the Knicks take an 11-point lead about eight minutes into the first quarter of Game 2. He then left the game about 30 seconds later and missed the remainder of the quarter and entirety of the second.\n\n\"All season long, no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back,\" Knicks guard Donte DiVincenzo said. \"We knew the severity of the game and everything. So we knew. Everybody had confidence he was coming back.\"\n\nThe Pacers took advantage of Brunson's injury absence, immediately going on a 11-0 run to tie the score. Both teams totaled 36 points in the first quarter.\n\nGuard Tyrese Haliburton and forward Obi Toppin scored 13 and 10 points, respectively, for the Pacers through the first 12 minutes. The Pacers then outscored the Knicks 37-27 in the second to take a 73-63 lead at halftime.\n\nBut Brunson's third-quarter return gave the Knicks a major boost.\n\nThey reeled off a 14-0 run early in the second half to snatch back the lead. Brunson totaled 10 points, while DiVincenzo scored a dozen in the third quarter. The Knicks outshot the Pacers 66.7% to 33.3% in the frame to carry a 99-91 lead into the fourth.\n\nThe Pacers, who shot 60% down the stretch, cut the deficit to one point about four minutes into the final frame, but never closed their last deficit.\n\n\"We are just sticking together, no matter what,\" said Brunson, who scored 14 over the final 12 minutes to seal the victory. \"No matter what the situation is, no matter what's thrown at us, no matter what is a disadvantage for us, we are going to stick together.\n\n\"That's the thing we always harp on for each other.\"\n\nThe All-Star guard made 11 of 18 attempts on the night. He also chipped in five assists and three steals. DiVincenzo scored 28 points on 10 of 20 shooting. He made 6 of 12 attempts from 3-point range.\n\nKnicks forward O.G. Anunoby logged 28 points. Forward Josh Hart chipped in 19 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. Center Isaiah Hartenstein logged 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.\n\nHaliburton paced the Pacers with 34 points, nine assists and six steals. He made 7 of 11 3-point attempts. Guard T.J. McConnell totaled 10 points and 12 assists off the Pacers bench. Toppin scored another 20 points off the Pacers bench.\n\nGame 3 will tip off at 7 p.m. EDT Friday in Indianapolis. With a Game 3 victory, they could sweep the series Sunday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Game 5, if necessary, will be Tuesday in New York. The series could extend to Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_butler@bradenton.com", "name": "Alex Butler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Brunson's performance mirrored Willis Reed's epic comeback, 54 years to the day the Knicks legend led the team to the 1970 NBA title. Brunson is leading the playoffs in fourth quarter points.\n\nNew York Knicks fans held their breath for a while when Jalen Brunson went and stayed in the locker room due to a foot injury for the entire second quarter of Game 2 against the Indiana Pacers. Brunson, however, emerged from the locker room and warmed up during half-time to send the Madison Square Garden crowd into a frenzy.\n\nWith his return, the Knicks overcame a 10-point deficit at the break. Brunson spearheaded New York's second half comeback to lead the Knicks to the 130-121 victory and secure a 2-0 series lead over the Pacers.\n\nWith the injury scare still quite a concern following the game, Brunson gave an optimistic update on his foot and assured Knicks fans that he will be fine moving forward as the series shifts to Indiana for Game 3.\n\n\"I'm all good, and that's it... I just felt a little discomfort, and then went from there.\" - Jalen Brunson\n\nJalen Brunson Channels Willis Reed In Game 2 Brunson's 24 second half points helped Knicks overcome 10-point halftime deficit\n\nJalen Brunson channeled his own Willis Reed in Game 2 with his epic comeback to lead the Knicks to victory on Wednesday night. Coincidentally, Brunson's epic return came 54 years to the day when the Knicks legend dramatically emerged from the locker room in Game 7 of the NBA Finals to lead New York to the 1970 NBA Championship.\n\nNew York predictably struggled without their franchise superstar throughout the second period, but his inspirational return in the second half fueled the Knicks to a 36-18 third quarter.\n\nJalen Brunson 2nd Half Stats vs. Pacers\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n24\n\nAST\n\n4\n\nFG-A\n\n9-16\n\n3P-A\n\n2-5\n\nBrunson poured in 24 of his 29 points in the second half, including 14 in the fourth quarter. He made several clutch baskets down the stretch, including a tough floater in the lane with 41 seconds remaining to put the Pacers to bed in Game 2.\n\nUnfortunately, Brunson's streak of 40-point games came to a halt at three, largely due to the 12 minutes he missed in the second quarter. But nonetheless, the spitfire point guard still came through when his team needed him the most, as he has done all season long.\n\nJalen Brunson: The King of the Fourth Knicks star leads the NBA in 4th quarter points in the playoffs\n\nIt's honestly worth wondering just where the New York Knicks would be without Jalen Brunson. The Knicks have been dealt with several injuries throughout the course of the season and even into the playoffs.\n\nJulius Randle (shoulder), Mitchell Robinson (ankle), and Bojan Bogdanovic (foot) are all done for the year. Heck, even OG Anunoby suffered a hamstring injury midway through Game 2 and did not return and his status for Game 3 is still up in the air.\n\nWith all these injuries, Brunson has carried the Knicks time and time again throughout the playoffs. The man has especially done the heavy lifting when the pressure is at its highest. Brunson is currently leading the 2024 NBA Playoffs in fourth quarter scoring, averaging 10.4 points per game. Over his last three games, he is turning in 16.3 points on over 57 percent shooting in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Knicks have a chance to put a stranglehold on this series if they are able to take Game 3 in Indiana on Friday.\n\nRelated Knicks' Josh Hart Gave Commentator Reggie Miller NSFW Update From Crowd Reggie Miller is no friend to the crowd at Madison Square Garden.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-09-may-2024-01-40-am-5441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the Pacers leave New York in a 2-0 hole after the Knicks pulled away late.\n\nOn the same night that Jalen Brunson suffered a foot injury, which cost him the second quarter but inspired a miraculous second half, they lost their defensive stopper, OG Anunoby. It's not clear when they will get him back.\n\nBrunson hurt his foot near the end of the first quarter but strode back out onto the floor at halftime, revving for 25 points just in the second half of the win. Anunoby didn't have the same fortune.\n\nHe exited the game in the third quarter, holding his left hamstring as he limped to the locker room. The Knicks ruled him out with \"left hamstring soreness\" not long later.\n\nNew York may have won without him. It clamped down the Pacers, by Indiana's ridiculous offensive standards, in the fourth quarter. But until the injury, Anunoby was soaring to his greatest game since joining the Knicks more than four months ago: 28 points, four rebounds and three assists.\n\nHe is the backbone of the Knicks defense. If they have him moving forward, the Knicks are in good shape to keep winning. If they don't, it opens the door a little more for the Pacers. -- Fred Katz\n\nThe Indiana Pacers had their chances.\n\nThey almost stole Game 1 before a disastrous final minute. They had the Knicks on the ropes, and hurting, in Game 2. New York kept losing key players and the Pacers kept gaining opportunities. But they will head back to Indianapolis down 2-0 in this series after a 130-121 Game 2 loss at Madison Square Garden.\n\nWednesday, they just couldn't match the Knicks' competitiveness, their talent, their relentless drive. The Knicks keep losing starters -- and Jalen Brunson for 15-plus minutes in the first half -- and it doesn't matter. The Pacers keep losing games in New York. Tyrese Haliburton rebounded for a big game, finding the right setting for his aggressiveness to score 31 points and dish out nine assists. TJ McConnell was again a sparkplug with 10 points and 12 assists. Obi Toppin even came off the bench to give them 20 points.\n\nDidn't matter.\n\nThe Knicks are the team with an Adamantium skeleton and the Pacers can't keep them down.

Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau spoke about what makes Brunson special after being asked a question related to the Willis Reed game, which happened on the same day 54 years earlier.\n\n\"That's such a big part of this franchise, and rightfully so,\" Tom Thibodeau said, via NBA on X. \"As I said, the best part of Jalen is his humility. We could all talk about the great things he's doing, and it's remarkable, but to be as humble as he is on top of that, I think that's what makes him so special.\"\n\nJalen Brunson did not put up another 40 points in this game, which he had done a lot in these playoffs, including in Game 1. He still did put up 29 points in 32 minutes, leading the Knicks in scoring. The Knicks were down by double digits early in the second half as a result of Brunson missing a big chunk of the game.\n\nAfter the Pacers made the first basket of the second half, the Knicks took off and outscored them 36-18 in the third quarter overall. The fourth quarter was tight, but the Knicks were able to close out the win, despite losing OG Anunoby to a hamstring injury.\n\nThe Pacers are upset at many of the calls that took place in this series so far in the first two games, submitting 78 plays to the league. The Knicks have been able to escape with a 2-0 series lead despite a limited rotation and having Brunson and OG Anunoby off of the court for significant minutes in Game 2.\n\nKnicks' outlook for the rest of the series\n\nAs the series shifts to Indiana for Games 3 and 4 of the series, the Knicks will look to take at least one of the two games on the road. It will be tough, and they might be without Anunoby for the rest of the series as well, who is an important defender and shooter for the team. That puts even more of a load on Brunson's shoulders, who is dealing with a foot injury himself.\n\nThe Knicks' rotation is very short, and Indiana's pace will continue to test them throughout the series. It will be worth monitoring the injury statuses for Brunson and Anunoby ahead of Friday's Game 3.\n\nNew York will continue to try to weather the storm and get to the Eastern Conference Finals, while the Pacers will look to respond at home to even up the series with wins in the next two.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThings were looking bleak for the New York Knicks when Jalen Brunson, their MVP all season, didn't play the entire second quarter due to injury.\n\nBut when Brunson returned in the second half, the Knicks returned to form to defeat the Indiana Pacers in Game 2, 130-121, to take a two-game lead in their second round series in the NBA Playoffs.\n\nNew York battled back from 10 points down at halftime thanks to Brunson's efforts. He led the Knicks once again in the points department, though he wasn't able to make it five straight postseason contests with 40 or more points.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nBrunson finished with 29 on 11-of-18 shooting, including 3-of-6 from three-point territory, while dishing five assists and tallying three steals.\n\n\"I'm just happy I did, to be honest with you. We found a way,\" Brunson said after the game to TNT about returning to the game.\n\nWhen Brunson went out, Madison Square Garden couldn't figure out why and it led the raucous Knicks faithful to murmur. It was then where the Pacers started to change the tune of the game, outscoring the Knicks with fastbreak buckets and wide open three-pointers. They won the second quarter in the box score, 37-27, to score 73 first-half points.\n\nMITCHELL ROBINSON LIKELY TO MISS REST OF PLAYOFFS WITH 'STRESS INJURY' IN ANKLE, KNICKS ANNOUNCE\n\nTyrese Haliburton was a key factor in the Pacers' charge, as he had a much better game offensively than Game 1, where he had just six points with six total shots. Haliburton finished with a game-high 34 points with seven three-pointers made, including five in the first half.\n\nBut MSG erupted when Brunson came out with a few minutes left in halftime to warm up, and after testing that foot, he told head coach Tom Thibodeau he was ready to get back in there.\n\nThe Knicks would end up destroying the Pacers in the third quarter, 36-18, to retake the lead heading into the fourth.\n\nAnd while the Pacers were relentless, Brunson and the Knicks continued to do what they do best: get the ball in the hands of their star point guard, grab offensive rebounds and close out big games.\n\nNow, while Brunson did return, the Knicks didn't leave this game without some bad injury news.\n\nOG Anunoby, who had 28 points on 10-of-19 shooting, was sprinting up the court for a chance at a fastbreak bucket when he came up limping near the basket. The Knicks ruled him out the rest of the game with a sore left hamstring, and they'll certainly hope it won't persist into Friday's Game 3 matchup on the road.\n\nThe Knicks were already without Mitchell Robinson, who found out he re-injured the ankle that kept him out 50 games in the regular season. He's likely going to miss the rest of the playoffs.\n\nBut as Thibodeau said ahead of the fourth quarter, the next man just has to step up. Donte DiVincenzo played his role with 28 points, shooting 10-of-20 with six made threes, while Isaiah Hartenstein collected 12 rebounds and 14 points. Josh Hart also led the way in the rebounding department with 15 while totaling 19 points himself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor the Pacers, Andrew Nembhard had 15 points on 7-of-9 shooting, while Obi Toppin led the way off the bench with 20 points against his former team. T.J. McConnell was also pestering Brunson when he returned in the second half on the defensive side of the ball. Offensively, he had 10 points and a team-high 12 assists.\n\nThe series now heads to Indianapolis, where the Pacers have their backs up against the walls a bit down two games to none as the Knicks fought through injuries to take another game at home.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_thompson@foxnews.com", "name": "Scott Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

It serenaded him with more \"MVP!\" chants.\n\nJust like that, the worry and fear about his status dissipated.\n\nWith Brunson back in the game, the Knicks regained control and went on a 21-6 run to take a five-point lead midway through the third quarter.\n\nThe Knicks outscored the Pacers 36-18 in the period, which ended with the Knicks leading by eight.\n\nBrunson finished with 29 points on 11-of-18 shooting (3-of-6 from deep) with two rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nOG Anunoby has a big game before leaving in second half due to injury\n\nAnunoby was stellar from the very beginning.\n\nHe was aggressive going to the basket, he knocked down threes and he played well on the defensive end as usual.\n\nBut all of that came to an end in the second half when Anunoby left the game - the team later announced it was due to a sore left hamstring.\n\nSo these injury-riddled Knicks have one more to deal with, though it's unclear at this point how it'll affect his status for the rest of the playoffs.\n\nAnunoby had 28 points on 10-of-19 shooting (4-of-7 from three-point range) with four rebounds and three assists when he left Game 2.\n\nThe Knicks are already without Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic for the rest of the playoffs.\n\nIronman Josh Hart keeps it going\n\nAt this point, Josh Hart may never leave the court again. He again played all 48 minutes.\n\nWhile Brunson has (rightfully) gotten so much attention for the way he's played in the playoffs, Hart has also routinely come up huge - playing every minute along the way.\n\nHart finished Game 2 with 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting (1-of-3 from long distance) with 15 rebounds and seven assists.\n\nHe drained a three-pointer with just less than eight minutes to go in the fourth quarter to put the Knicks ahead by four.\n\nPrecious Achiuwa getting big opportunity with Mitchell Robinson out\n\nThe Knicks' frontcourt depth has taken a hit without Robinson, but that's opened up an opportunity for Achiuwa.\n\nHe responded nicely in Game 2, finishing with eight points and five rebounds in 28 minutes.\n\nAchiuwa made a big play with just less than four minutes to go in the fourth quarter.\n\nBrunson missed a three but Donte DiVincenzo grabbed the rebound. He passed to Achiuwa, who finished with a dunk to put the Knicks up 117-110.\n\nAchiuwa played four minutes in Game 1 against the Pacers and only played in Games 3 and 4 against the 76ers in the first round (30 combined minutes).\n\nBut he's managed to stay ready.\n\n\"I want to give my teammates credit, they do a great job,\" Achiuwa said before the game. \"We play pickup sometimes, that helps me a lot, stay in game shape, stay in rhythm, stuff like that.

The last four minutes of Game 1, painful as they were, needed to be seen again.\n\nThey were a rough sight for the Pacers the first time. A lead slipped away. A number of careless errors. The catastrophe of a final minute. The questionable calls from officials that peppered a team already trying to avoid free-fall. All crunched together in such a short period.\n\nBut the Pacers coach took it all in again. Indiana lost Game 1 to the New York Knicks 121-117 at Madison Square Garden and with it, a golden opportunity to grab control of the series, withstanding a faulty performance from All-Star Tyrese Haliburton and an onslaught of unfavorable calls over the last 52 seconds.\n\nThe Pacers tried their best to avoid shifting blame from themselves and onto the officials after the game. They had their merits. Indiana may have played a sloppy final stanza, but it was done no favors by a slew of calls: an incorrect kicked-ball violation on Aaron Nesmith with 52 seconds left; an illegal screen by Myles Turner with 12.7 seconds remaining that floored Donte DiVincenzo and stood strong after a replay review; a foul on Andrew Nembhard before a single tick went off the clock and the Knicks could inbound the ball. That last one all but iced the game as Jalen Brunson made a free throw and the Knicks retained possession.\n\n\"I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said. \"I think it's unfortunate that it happened. We reviewed it; they still called it an illegal screen. But it's the playoffs, man. I feel like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it. For the most part you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. So we have to take accountability as well. Of course it's right after the game, I'm a little fresh in my emotions about it, but we know, at the end of the day, we can't get to that position.\n\n\"The Last Two Minute report, we're all looking forward to that coming out. I think there was two controversial calls. We had to use our challenge on one call on Tyrese. And then the kickball by Aaron Nesmith that was not a kickball -- you can clearly see it on the replay.\"\n\nThe harried final minute overshadowed a scintillating game Haliburton struggled, scoring just six points on six shots as he played through a back injury, so the Pacers looked for a jolt elsewhere. Pascal Siakam had 19 points, and T.J. McConnell came off the bench for 18. Turner had 23 points and provided vital rim protection. After toppling the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and benefiting from injuries to Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard, the Pacers seemed primed to upset the Knicks too.\n\nThis was supposed to be a clash of two disparate styles, the fun-and-fast Pacers and the deliberate-and-physical Knicks. Instead, Indiana led throughout the first half by turning the matchup on its head and beating New York at its own game. The Pacers dominated the boards, matched the Knicks' pugnacity and bullied them around at times. It was good enough for a six-point halftime lead.\n\nEven as the Knicks rebounded to form in the second half, the Pacers kept pace. The teams exchanged leads late in the fourth quarter and entered the final minute tied. Then it all went haywire for Indiana.\n\nNesmith was called for that kickball, negating what was about to lead to a Knicks turnover and an opportunity in the open court. Instead, officials said the ball hit Nesmith's leg. After the game, crew chief Zach Zarba told a pool reporter the call had been wrong and the ball hit Nesmith's right hand. DiVincenzo hit a 3 on the ensuing possession to give New York a 118-115 lead that Indiana could not overcome.\n\nAfter the game, even with the knowledge in hand that Zarba had admitted an error, McConnell could not say the right call may have swung the night.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" he said. \"There were plays that we could have made that it doesn't even come down to that. Unfortunate, but we got to move on and fix things that we didn't do well.\"\n\nWith the Knicks up 118-117, Brunson lost the ball out of bounds near his own basket with 22.1 seconds left while trying to dribble up-court against Nembhard's pressing defense. The Knicks challenged, and it was overturned.\n\nWith Indiana still down by one on the next possession, Turner was called for the offensive foul trying to screen for Haliburton just above the 3-point line. The Pacers reviewed it but saw the call upheld. That cost Indiana its last timeout.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating,\" Carlisle said. \"We're not expecting to get calls in here. It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. That's just the way it goes. We challenged it. They reviewed. They got a bunch of people in New Jersey who agreed with them, so that's just the way it goes. We gotta learn from that too. That's a timing play. Both guys are involved. We'll have to execute that better next time.\"\n\nAs the Knicks tried to inbound the ball from center court, Nembhard was called for a foul before any pass after he slipped his right hand around Brunson's torso. That sent Brunson to the free-throw line and allowed the Knicks to keep possession. There was little Indiana could do after that.\n\nThe cacophony of errors crested into a difficult defeat. The Pacers had played like the better team for so much of the night, even with Haliburton lagging. They came into MSG and pushed around the Knicks for long stretches. But they had not steeled themselves for the recrimination to come. Josh Hart played all 48 minutes and launched himself across the court like a torpedo at times, scoring 24 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. Brunson scored 43 points and served as a ballast.\n\nThe Pacers had no such anchor late in the game. Now, they'll have to adjust to the rigors of what will surely be a brutally tough series. The Knicks leave opponents battered and blue; the Philadelphia 76ers can tell tales from home. The Pacers were able to undercut them for a half and will need to find a way to replicate it again, pushing the short-handed Knicks with their nine-deep rotation and a preference to play fast and try to punish a foe short on depth. It worked for a while Monday, before it all came apart.\n\nIt was an education for a young team still new to such experiences. Siakam won a title with the Toronto Raptors and McConnell had logged a few playoff games in years prior, but this is the first postseason run for the core of Indiana's roster. Haliburton is making his maiden run through the playoffs. The first-round win over the Bucks was the first playoff series Turner had won in his nine-year career.\n\n\"There's so many events in an NBA game,\" Carlisle said. \"They're always a sharp focus on the last minute, but there were things that happened with five or six minutes left that really hurt us. We had one play where one of our guys took a wild run to try to gamble and steal the ball, and it turned into a four-point play for them. I think we had a five-point lead at the time, and so, it's not just the last minute or two. It's a whole game. The whole fourth quarter. So this is a great experience for our guys. It comes at a cost. It's so fun. But we're gonna have to learn some things for Game 2.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorkunov@theathletic.com", "name": "Mike Vorkunov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Knicks star Jalen Brunson suffered an injury scare and exited in the first-half with a foot issue. He ultimately returned in the second-half, though.\n\nBrunson was asked if there was any doubt about his return after the win, via NBA on TNT.\n\n\"I'm just happy I did (return) to be honest with you,\" Brunson said. \"We found a way, that's it.\"\n\nThe Knicks trailed at the half. New York never lost hope, though. They fought hard and ultimately took the lead in the second-half. Brunson finished the game with 29 points, five assists, and three steals to lead the way.\n\nHe discussed New York's motivation and willingness to fight for wins as well.\n\n\"I mean, we just find ways,\" Brunson said. \"I think for us it just starts with our habits. We've talked about doing the little things since day one. The little things matter. You never know when they're going to help you in the big game... It's all about doing the little things every single day. I think we pride ourselves on that.\"\n\nSo is Brunson ready for Indiana after suffering the injury scare on Wednesday?\n\n\"I'm going to try to be.\"\n\nThe Knicks took care of business at home. They hold a 2-0 lead, but the Pacers will present a difficult matchup in Indiana. This series is far from over.\n\nJalen Brunson not intimidated by playoff challenge\n\nBrunson performed well during the regular season. He was not an MVP finalist, but still received consideration for the award.\n\nSome stars cannot handle the bright lights of the NBA playoffs. Brunson, however, steps up and plays even better in the big moments.\n\nThrough eight games in the 2024 postseason, the Knicks star is averaging 35.6 points per game on 45.7 percent field goal shooting. He is also recording 8.1 assists and 4.4 rebounds per outing.\n\nBrunson managed to have a great game on Wednesday despite missing time due to the aforementioned injury. He is determined and unwilling to let anything stop him.\n\nOf course, Brunson had some help in Game 2. OG Anunoby and Donte DiVincenzo both scored 28 points. Josh Hart added 19 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists. Isaiah Hartenstein scored 14 points to go along with 12 rebounds and eight assists.\n\nThe Knicks' 2024 playoff outlook was uncertain given Julius Randle's injury. New York certainly misses Randle, but they are still finding ways to win. Jalen Brunson continues to lead while the rest of the roster produces at a respectable level.\n\nThe Knicks still have work to do in this series. Again, the Pacers are not going to go down without a fight. Game 3 is going to be a must-win affair for Indiana, however.\n\nNew York is currently in the driver's seat. Of course, they will closely monitor Brunson's injury. He will be able to rest on Thursday before Game 3 on Friday night.\n\nWe will continue to monitor and provide updates on Brunson's status as they are made available.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_mistretta@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Joey Mistretta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jalen-Brunsons-blunt-admission-after-Game-2-injury-scare-vs.-Pacers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He gestured to the Knicks' bench that he needed to exit as he hobbled up the court.\n\nHe left the game with four minutes left in the first quarter, and by halftime, the team declared Brunson was questionable to return due to a sore right foot.\n\nAfter the game, Jalen Brunson spoke to the media during the post-game presser, where he was asked about his collision with Andrew Nembhard, to which he replied:\n\n\"He hit me ...

He again led the team in scoring, although he fell short of reaching 40 or more points for the fifth consecutive postseason game.\n\nJalen ended the game with 29 points, shooting 11 of 18 from the field, including 3 of 6 from beyond the arc, while also recording five assists and three steals.\n\nThe Knicks took control in the third quarter, outscoring the Pacers 36-18 to regain the lead as they headed into the fourth.\n\nDespite the Pacers' tenacity, Brunson and the Knicks excelled in their strengths: getting the ball to their standout point guard, securing offensive rebounds, and closing out tight games.\n\nWhile Jalen did make his return, the game wasn't without its setbacks for the Knicks. OG Anunoby, who scored 28 points on 10 of 19 shooting, pulled up limping near the basket during a fastbreak opportunity.\n\nThe Knicks later announced he would miss the remainder of the game with a sore left hamstring, an issue they hope will not continue into Game 3 on the road this Friday.\n\nThe Knicks were also without Mitchell Robinson, who had re-injured the ankle that sidelined him for 50 games during the regular season.

The Knicks outlasted the Pacers 121-117 on Monday night after two questionable calls favoring the home team.\n\nAaron Nesmith was called for a kickball violation even though he cleanly deflected the ball with his hands, while Myles Turner was whistled for an illegal screen. Donte DiVincenzo put the Knicks up by three points after the kickball fiasco and the Pacers were only down by a point when the moving screen was called.\n\nNevertheless, Indiana failed to stop Jalen Brunson, who had 43 points, six rebounds and six assists. It was Brunson's fourth straight game with at least 40 points. He's only the fourth player in NBA history to achieve the feat in the postseason.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks Top 10 player props for Game 2\n\n#10 - Aaron Nesmith, Points - Over 11.5 (+102)\n\nAaron Nesmith had 12 points in 30 minutes of action in Game 1. Nesmith is not known for his scoring, but he was aggressive on Monday night. He went to the free throw line six times and made all six.\n\n#9 - Isaiah Hartenstein, Pts+Rebs - Over 20.5 (-110)\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein provided the New York Knicks with 13 points and six rebounds in Game 1. Hartenstein has been a vital part of the Knicks starting lineup despite the availability of Mitchell Robinson.\n\n#8 - Andrew Nembhard, Points - Under 11.5 (-121)\n\nThe Indiana Pacers kept things close against the New York Knicks in Game 1 despite Andrew Nembhard being in foul trouble. Nembhard only played 29 minutes, but still managed to get 11 points, two rebounds and four assists.\n\n#7 - Donte DiVincenzo, 3-Pointers Made - Over 3.5 (+108)\n\nDonte DiVincenzo hit the go-ahead 3-point shot in the New York Knicks' Game 1 win over the Indiana Pacers. DiVincenzo went 5-for-9 from beyond the arc and finished with 25 points, three rebounds and two blocks.\n\n#6 - Josh Hart, Rebounds - Under 12.5 (+100)\n\nJosh Hart has been killing it on the glass in the entire postseason. Hart is averaging double-digit rebounds and grabbed 13 rebounds in Game 1. He also had 24 points, eight assists and three steals.\n\n#5 - Myles Turner, Points - Over 17.5 (-114)\n\nMyles Turner has turned into a score in this postseason for the Indiana Pacers. Turner is averaging 19.7 points per game in the playoffs and scored 23 points on 50.0% shooting from the floor in Game 1.\n\n#4 - OG Anunoby, Points - Over 16.5 (-102)\n\nOG Anunoby struggled with his shot in Game 1, scoring just 13 points on 14 shots. Anunoby will have to be more efficient if the New York Knicks want to take a 2-0 lead against the Indiana Pacers heading into Games 3 and 4.\n\n#3 - Pascal Siakam, Points - Over 19.5 (-120)\n\nPascal Siakam had another solid outing for the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 with 19 points, six rebounds and five assists. Siakam has not scored at least 20 points since Game 2 of their first round series against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n#2 - Tyrese Haliburton, Pts+Ast - Under 26.5 (-115)\n\nTyrese Haliburton was not just outplayed by Jalen Brunson, but he was outperformed by his backup TJ McConnell. Haliburton only had six points and eight assists in Game 1, while McConnell put up 18 points, three assists and three steals.\n\n#1 - Jalen Brunson, Points - Over 36.5 (-124)\n\nJalen Brunson has scored at least 40 points in four straight playoff games. Brunson extended his streak in Game 1 with 43 points on 14-for-26 shooting from the field and 14-for-14 from the charity stripe. He has been nearly unstoppable for the New York Knicks this postseason, especially on the offensive end.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_paolo_david@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Juan Paolo David", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23210332-1715164333.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Jalen Brunson's shot at stardom was clear to Tom Thibodeau when he was in high school. Donte DiVincenzo saw it as soon as they became teammates in college.\n\nRick Carlisle witnessed it as Brunson's first professional coach -- and now has to figure out how to slow down a player on the longest scoring roll in the postseason since Michael Jordan three decades ago.\n\nBrunson will try to help the New York Knicks take a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday in the only game on the NBA schedule.\n\nBrunson scored 43 points on Monday in the Knicks' 121-117 victory in Game 1. He has scored 40 or more in four straight games, the first player to do that in the postseason since Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals, and is just the fourth player ever to do that.\n\nYet he insists he never goes into a game thinking about how much he needs to score, even on a Knicks team missing points from injured fellow All-Star Julius Randle.\n\n\"I think, what can you do, how can we be aggressive, how can we attack and where can we get the best advantage for our team,\" Brunson said Tuesday. \"And it has nothing to do with me saying I need to hit this amount of points, I need to hit this amount of shots. It's just, I'm reading how the game is being played and that's just my mindset and that's how it always has been.\"\n\nThibodeau first noticed it watching Brunson grow up, particularly when he became a high school star in Illinois while Thibodeau was coaching the Chicago Bulls. He has always been impressed by the way Brunson was never satisfied -- and still isn't -- and cares far more about team success than any individual accolades.\n\n\"I think that that's what makes him who he is,\" Thibodeau said. \"And right now this is what we need for us to win.\"\n\nBrunson has followed his first All-Star season by leading all players in postseason scoring with 36.6 points per game. The second-round pick in the 2018 draft had some big games in his first three seasons playing for Dallas, but as Carlisle noted, the Mavericks were Luka Doncic's team.\n\nThe Knicks signed Brunson in July 2022, and he has led them to two straight trips to the East semifinals after they hadn't won a playoff series since 2013.\n\n\"So when he came here, it was pretty clear right off the bat that Thibs just said, 'Hey, this is your thing,' and when you give a strong-willed guy like that the green light -- because Jalen, as aggressive a scorer as he is, is one of the great team guys I've ever been around in this league, or any sport at any level,\" Carlisle said. \"I mean, he's just really exceptional.\n\n\"Amazing things can happen for your team and a lot of bad things can happen for opponents. So hats off to New York for being able to sign him and he's been historically great here.\"\n\nTyrese Haliburton, the other All-Star point guard in the series, wasn't great in Game 1. The NBA's assists leader in the regular season, who has been bothered by back spasms, was limited to six points and eight assists for Indiana.\n\n\"We were playing ahead in Game 1 and feel like we should've won that game,\" Haliburton said, \"but at the end of the day it starts with me, and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nBrunson has the same expectation.\n\nDiVincenzo saw how much Brunson prepares while they were teammates for two NCAA championships at Villanova, and how he's able to solve opponents as games go on.\n\nIn Game 1, that meant passing to DiVincenzo for the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 40 seconds left, just as Brunson called someone else's number for the decisive shot in the first round when he passed to Josh Hart for a tiebreaking 3 with 25 seconds left in Game 6 against Philadelphia.\n\n\"He studies the game, he knows how teams are going to adjust and he continues to make adjustments himself,\" DiVincenzo said while sitting next to Brunson for their Game 1 news conference. \"He finds different ways to be successful.\n\n\"He's always had this, it's just now you guys are seeing it on this stage.\"\n\nPACERS AT KNICKS\n\nKnicks lead, 1-0. Game 2, 8 p.m. EDT, TNT\n\n-- NEED TO KNOW: The postseason record for consecutive 40-point games is held by Jerry West, who had six in a row in 1965. Bernard King, a Hall of Famer who played for the Knicks, also did it four straight times in 1984.\n\nSpeaking of playoff scoring, Reggie Miller will be part of the crew calling the game for TNT. Tuesday was the 29th anniversary of Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds to rally the Pacers past the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 East semifinals.\n\n-- KEEP AN EYE ON: The Knicks' bench, to see how often Thibodeau sends someone off it into the game. Indiana had a 46-3 edge in points from its reserves, led by T.J. McConnell (18) and Obi Toppin (12). Mitchell Robinson, Deuce McBride and Precious Achiuwa were so ineffective in their minutes that Thibodeau was forced to play Hart all 48, DiVincenzo and Brunson nearly 44 and OG Anunoby 42.\n\n-- INJURY WATCH: The Knicks ruled Robinson out for left ankle injury management.

Whatever triggered Brunson's right foot injury, which he appeared to tweak in the first quarter of Wednesday's Game 2 of the second-round series between the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers, the impact was obvious. There was no burst on Brunson's first drive to the basket in the third quarter. Defensively, he looked a step slow. Coming out of the locker room, coach Tom Thibodeau didn't know if Brunson was going to be able to play in the second half. A few minutes in, Thibodeau was likely wondering when he would have to pull him.\n\nOnly he didn't. The shots started falling. The foot loosened up. Brunson scored 10 points in the third quarter, when the Knicks turned a 10-point halftime deficit into an eight-point third-quarter lead. He racked up 14 in the fourth. After sitting out the entire second quarter, Brunson didn't sit a minute in the second half. On the 54th anniversary of Willis Reed hobbling out of the Madison Square Garden tunnel to help the Knicks win Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals, Brunson, who finished with 29 points in New York's 130-121 win, helped push the Knicks one game closer to getting there.\n\n\"A lot of toughness,\" Thibodeau said.\n\n\"I was going to give it a go,\" Brunson said. \"No matter what.\"\n\nEach game, the legend of Brunson grows. His 36 points per contest in April helped push the Knicks, who have been without Julius Randle since late January, into the No. 2 seed. His 35.5 points against the Philadelphia 76ers powered New York into the second round. Against Indiana, armed with its own star point guard, Tyrese Haliburton, Brunson has been electric. He scored 43 in Game 1. In Game 2, he racked up 24 of his points in the second half.\n\n\"I mean, he's a warrior,\" Knicks guard Donte DiVincenzo said. \"That's all I got. There was no doubt in our minds that he would be back. All season long, no matter what was thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back. We knew the severity of the game. Everybody had confidence he was coming back.\"\n\nHe needed to. Indiana came out firing in Game 2. Haliburton, who was held to six points in Game 1, more than doubled it (13) in the first quarter. Obi Toppin, who the Knicks discarded last summer for a pair of second-round picks, had 10 off the bench. Indy's full-court defense seemed to wear down a Knicks team that rarely goes to its bench. The Pacers shot 57.1% from the field in the first half -- including 52.6% from three -- and looked poised to send the series back to Indiana tied at one.\n\nBut there is a relentlessness to these Knicks. It begins with Brunson. But it continues to DiVincenzo, who scored 20 in the second half. To Josh Hart. Hart averaged 46.3 minutes against Philadelphia. He's played all 48 in both games against Indiana. \"Thibs always asks me if I need [a break],\" Hart said, \"and I always tell him no.\" Isaiah Hartenstein is averaging 13.5 points and nine rebounds in this series and is shooting 62.5%.\n\n\"We're just sticking together no matter what,\" Brunson said. \"No matter what the situation is, no matter what's thrown at us, no matter what's a disadvantage for us, we're going to stick together. That's just the thing that we always harp on for each other.\"\n\nThe Knicks will take a commanding 2-0 lead to Indiana but make no mistake, the Pacers are not going away. A couple of bad whistles cost them a chance to win Game 1 and Indiana had its chances in Game 2. Haliburton (34 points) sprung to life Wednesday, and T.J. McConnell's pesky defense gave Brunson trouble. New York, meanwhile, lost O.G. Anunoby in the third quarter with a hamstring injury and Brunson's foot won't have much recovery time before Friday's Game 3.\n\nStill, there's a swagger to these Knicks. It flows from Brunson, the second-round pick turned starter, the starter turned All-Star, the All-Star who will add All-NBA to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the days to come. On Wednesday, Nikola Joki\u0107 was named MVP for the third time. Brunson finished fifth in the voting. If voters could re-vote and include postseason performance, it's likely he would finish even higher.\n\nThere is, said DiVincenzo, \"a level of calmness\" when Brunson is on the floor. A \"mental toughness,\" added Thibodeau. \"We have him on the court with us and everybody can settle down and play their own game,\" DiVincenzo said. Added Thibodeau, \"the ability to get through things, to be at your best, when your best is needed, even when you may not be feeling your best, and that's who he is, a great leader.\"\n\nMore than 50 years after Reed made MSG rumble, Brunson heard the same roars. \"This place has been nothing but special for me,\" Brunson said. Indeed, though in these playoffs, Brunson has given special right back.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks' Hartenstein.\n\nCarlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" Carlisle said. \"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing.

Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks' Hartenstein.\n\nCarlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" Carlisle said. \"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing.

We'll be bringing you a betting prediction and pick for the upcoming game as the Knicks just defended home court and lead the series 2-0. Check out our NBA odds series for our Knicks-Pacers prediction and pick.\n\nThe New York Knicks are currently leading the series 2-0 after two solid wins the defend their home court. The Playoff environment in Madison Square Garden has been palpable all series and the Knicks escaped both close contests on the back of big second-half performances. After losing Mitchell Robinson and possibly more in through the first two games, they'll look to steal a win on the road in Indy.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers dropped both road games to start this series and through both games, they had several moments in which the tide was swinging in their favor. The Pacers' biggest gripe as been with the officiating all series, so they're hoping they can have some calls go their way while playing at home. They're 1-1 ATS during this series.\n\nThe New York Knicks have really shown their toughness during this series and even though they're dealing with injuries to some of their key players, they seem to find a way to win time and time again. They recently lost Mitchell Robinson after Game 1 and all of MSG held their breath when Jalen Brunson checked himself out of Game 2 with a foot injury. Still, Brunson returned to the game and posted 24 second-half points as the Knicks outscored the Pacers 36-18 in the third quarter. Both Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart have been huge for the Knicks this series and the \"Villanova 3\" is building something special in the Big Apple.\n\nJosh Hart has been a massive reason for the Knicks' success without Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson in the lineup. His 10+ rebounds per game this series have given the Knicks control on the boards and his ability to scoop offensive rebounds has bailed them out in several late-game situations. With DiVincenzo catching heat from three and Isaiah Hartenstein playing great on the defensive end, the Knicks are building some momentum that could be tough to beat.\n\nWhy The Pacers Could Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Indiana Pacers put up two very solid efforts in the opening games of this series and although they're down 0-2 at the moment, their efforts in keeping the Knicks' on their toes haven't gone unnoticed. With the most potent offense through the Regular Season, the Pacers are having success when they're able to push the ball and run out in transition. Their struggled begin when New York slows the pace of the game, so it'd be in their best interest to run down the floor and push the pace of this game. Tyrese Haliburton has had an increasingly prominent role in the scoring offense and they'll need him to be an aggressive scorer at home for this series.\n\nThe Pacers submitted over 70 plays to the NBA that they believe should be disputed during this series, so it's clear they have a problem with some of the officiating going on in New York. They won't have any excuses playing in their home building and they should look to get to the free throw line as often as possible. If they can force an already hobbled Knicks team into further foul trouble, they should be able to win their first game of this series.\n\nFinal Knicks-Pacers Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Knicks looked dominant on their way to a 2-0 lead in this series and it's clear they controlled the pace in both second halves from MSG. The Pacers saw a ton of success in Game 2 when pushing the tempo and running down the floor, but ultimately the offensive rebounding from New York and their dagger threes sealed the game. Coming into this Game 3, we see the betting lines take a massive swing in favor of the home Pacers.\n\nBoth Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby were banged-up during the Game 2 win and while they're likely to make the starts for Game 3, their availability is worth tracking as they may be feeling the physical toll on their bodies. With the Pacers healthy and hungry for a win, it's no surprise that the spread shifts in their favor.\n\nFor our prediction, we're going to roll with the Indiana Pacers to win and cover this spread. They have no put up 2 solid halves against the Knicks and were just a few plays away from stealing Game 1 on the road. They're 1-1 ATS so far in this series, but I expect the Knicks to be feeling some fatigue as they head to Indy. Let's ride the Pacers to cover in Game 3 as they swing back and make it 2-1.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominik_zawartko@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Dominik Zawartko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Knicks-vs.-Pacers-Game-3-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Tom Thibodeau praised Brunson's humility after the game, calling it Brunson's best trait. Brunson is having one of the all-time great playoff runs and cementing himself as a New York legend.\n\nJalen Brunson has continued to cement himself into New York Knicks history, but that doesn't mean he's focused on it.\n\nBrunson on Wednesday survived an injury scare in the first half against the Indiana Pacers before returning in the second half to lead the Knicks to a 130-121 Game 2 win.\n\nDespite missing the whole second quarter with a \"sore foot,\" Brunson played the entire second half and finished the game with 29 points on 11-of-18 shooting to go with 5 assists. The Knicks were +26 in Brunson's 32 minutes.\n\nThat Brunson carried the Knicks to a massive, come-from-behind win 50 years to the day that Willis Reed emerged from the tunnel in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals to lift the Knicks to the championship is a coincidence too great for script-writers.\n\nWith Brunson seemingly making history every game, it'd be understandable if the accolades got to his head. However, Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau told reporters after the game that it's quite the opposite.\n\n\"The best part of Jalen is his humility. We could all talk about all the great things he's doing, and it's remarkable, but to be as humble as he is on top of that, I think that's what makes him so special.\"\n\nThibodeau also commended Brunson for fighting through the physical discomfort.\n\n\"He's a great leader, and the players all have respect for that when a guy tries to give whatever he has. It says a lot about him. To me, the actions say a lot more than the words. It says that you care a lot about your team and your teammates.\"\n\nBrunson Authoring a Historic Playoff Run Brunson is quickly entering the pantheon of all-time great Knicks\n\nThe moment that perhaps best illustrated how Knicks fans feel about Brunson was the moment he ran onto the court at halftime to shoot and test his foot.\n\nBrunson was questionable to return to the game with his sore foot, and there was palpable tension in Madison Square Garden over whether the Knicks' franchise player had suffered a serious injury.\n\nInstead, the Garden roared as Brunson ran onto the court. As Brunson went through his shooting routine to test his foot, he was serenaded with \"MVP!\" chants.\n\nNone of it is over-the-top for Brunson. In just 1.5 years, he is already 16th all-time in playoff points, surpassing Carmelo Anthony on Wednesday. Brunson is the first player since Michael Jordan to score 40-plus points in four straight playoff games.\n\nFor Brunson to be leading an injury-riddled team to within two games of the Eastern Conference in such historic fashion, has already made him a New York legend.\n\nOf course, the Knicks will need him to keep going. Though they hold a 2-0 lead over the Pacers, the series now returns to Indiana, where the Pacers will be motivated to even things up after two close games in New York. And Knicks players seem to be dropping like flies. Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson have both been ruled for the season with injuries.\n\nOG Anunoby left Game 2 with a hamstring injury (his status has not yet been announced). Josh Hart has played 48 minutes in back-to-back games.

Hosting the Indians Pacers in Game 2, Jalen Brunson and company beat the allegations with a masterful performance down the stretch. Injuries to both Brunson and Anunoby amid the game had Knicks fans on the edge of their seats when ultimately, it was New York standing tall behind the tremendous depth the Knicks possess. The supporting cast stepped up tremendously in both players' absence and ultimately secured the victory with a final score of 121-130 in favor of New York.\n\nThe human utility belt, Josh Hart has been running through walls for the Knicks this entire playoffs. Hart has played 374 out of 384 possible minutes during this playoff run. In doing so, he has played back-to-back 48-minute games. That doesn't seem real, yet Hart has 48 minutes logged in his last two games, and his impact in both games shows the level of grit and tenacity that exists within him.\n\nIn both full games combined, Hart is averaging 21.5 points, 14 rebounds, and 7.5 assists. When asked about his unorthodox workload, Hart said, \"Thibs always asks me if I need [a break], and I always tell him no. It's something I want to do.\"\n\nThe mentality of Hart in these playoffs and his dedication to the New York Knicks will make a legend out of Hart in the Big Apple. He and the entire rotation fit the New York Knicks culture to the final sentiment and embody what the city is all about.\n\nThis star in the making is the Anunoby who signed to play for the New York Knicks. Truly Embracing his role with extended touches and more offensive production to match the stellar defensive performance he has every game out.\n\nIn Game 2, Anunoby scored a playoff-high 28 points in 28 minutes with four made threes in the contest. Unfortunately, late in the third quarter, Anunoby tweaked his hamstring and was seen laboring to the degree he couldn't run back up the floor. Proper precautions should be in play for Anunoby, expecting him to miss a few games to recover would be in the Knicks' best interest as they sit comfortably with a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Knicks can defeat this Pacers team without OG, but looking forward, he would be essential to a standoff against the Boston Celtics or Cleveland Cavaliers. New York now moves to 26-5 in games that Anunoby has played since being traded to the Knicks.\n\nThe perception of playoff DiVincenzo is altering in real time. Following a tough first-round series, Donte has stepped up to be what we saw all regular season for the Knicks. The 28-point performance in Game 2 marks the third straight 20-point game for DiVincenzo. In Games 1&2 combined in this second round, DiVincenzo is averaging 26.5 points with 11 threes made.\n\nThe trio of Brunson, Anunoby, and DiVincenzo marks just the second time in franchise history the Knicks have had three players score 25+ PTS in a playoff game. This hasn't happened in over 50 years, and the history-making occasion has the Knicks only two wins away from the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe Knicks tend to bring fans on a roller coaster of emotions, and Jalen Brunson, heading to the locker room late in the first quarter, took the air out of Madison Square Garden. 54 years ago, the famous 'Willis Reed' game took place, and once again in the present day, the arrival of Brunson after halftime set the Garden ablaze.\n\nA hurt and hobbled Brunson returned to score 24 points in the second half, ultimately putting the Pacers away on one foot in demoralizing fashion.\n\nThe fourth-quarter heroics from the Wildcat trio of Brunson, Hart, and Donte were the saving grace. As Brunson scored 14 in the fourth, it was a three from DiVincenzo, assisted by Hart, that was the dagger with 1:33 left to play.\n\nThe Knicks have already been without Julius Randle and Mitchell Robinson for extended time. Now, with no Bogdanovic as well, seeing a hobbled Brunson in the first quarter and Anunoby in the third, reality came fast to those realizing what the Knicks' chances of winning are without either one of Brunson and Anunoby.\n\nThis duo is the most important combination of players the Knicks possess, and in time, the two-man game from both will be New York's anchor. Until that is clear-cut, cementing themselves in these playoffs looks to be the goal for both players. Downplaying their injuries and staying with a tenacious mindset makes all the difference, but proper precaution should be valued going forward with a 2-0 series lead over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nThere is a perception growing outside of New York regarding the Knicks that people love to hate. Madison Square Garden in the playoffs is an experience on its own, and the culture that resides in New York City is unlike any in the entire association.\n\nThese attributes paired with a great team, cultivated countless memories, adding one with Reggie Miller court-side in Game 2, the local Knicks fan broke out in unison to chant unsportsmanlike words at the Pacers legend on the sideline:\n\nLooking ahead the Knicks now take the series on the road in what will be a hostile Game 3.

They outscored the Knicks, 56-39, to take a 10-point lead into the half.\n\nAnd then it happened. Brunson returned to save the day.\n\nFans at The Garden rose to their feet and cheered an empty basketball court as Brunson emerged from the tunnel to warm-up during the half, showering the All-Star guard with a combination of \"M-V-P\" and \"Ja-len Brun-son\" chants as he worked through his routine to help his team.\n\nHe would go on to play the entire second half, limited by a bad foot, and pilot the Knicks to a 130-121 victory in Game 2 against the Pacers.\n\nBrunson finished with 29 points on 11-of-18 shooting from the field and three-of-six shooting from behind the arc.\n\nThe Knicks outscored the Pacers, 67-48, in the minutes Brunson played in the second half.\n\nOG Anunoby also left the game in the third quarter and did not return due to a sore left hamstring.\n\nThe only injury this Knicks team can't withstand is one to their floor general. Their leader. The head of the snake for a Knicks team that has protected home court to take a 2-0 lead over the Pacers with the series shifting to Indiana for Games 3 and 4.\n\nYet the injuries continue to be a concern, as does the mileage the Knicks starters accrue playing heavy minutes for a team positioning itself for its deepest playoff run since 2000.\n\nAnunoby came up limping after a transition layup attempt and gingerly walked the length of the court straight to the locker room. It will be difficult to replace Anunoby, not just because of his floor spacing and staunch defensive presence, but because he and Josh Hart ranked atop the NBA playoffs in total minutes logged entering Wednesday's Game 3.\n\nThibodeau turned to Alec Burks for a short spurt of minutes while Brunson was out in the first half, but the 44 seconds proved fruitless.\n\nHart played his second consecutive 48-minute workload and his fourth full game of these playoffs. Donte DiVincenzo played 44 minutes, and Brunson never came out of the game in the second half after hurting his foot in the first.\n\nIt became clear after Wednesday's unlikely victory that it doesn't matter which Knicks suit up in orange and blue as long as Brunson can keep the show on the roll.\n\nThe show now goes on the road, where the Pacers now have to protect home court against the Knicks.\n\nThey had better hope Brunson is limited by his foot.

It was a noise so loud that Hartenstein and his teammates said they heard it from their lockers, and so intense that Brunson pleaded with fans to tone things down so he could find the mental clarity necessary to test his foot.\n\nThe MVP chants that the Knicks heard from the locker room, almost like a bat signal, suggested Brunson was back, prepared to lead the way. And indeed, Brunson's return energized the short-handed Knicks in the second half, helping them stage a comeback and push through multiple injuries to beat the Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 series lead in their conference semifinals.\n\n\"He's a great leader, and the players all have respect for that when a guy tries to give whatever he has. It says a lot about him,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"To me, the actions say a lot more than the words. It says that you care a lot about your team and your teammates.\"\n\nNew York's victory came with a cost as the series shifts to Indianapolis for Games 3 and 4. Star defender OG Anunoby, who had a playoff career-high 28 points in his 28 minutes of work, hobbled to the locker room in the third period and didn't return after injuring his left hamstring. Thibodeau said he had yet to speak with the team's medical staff to get a sense about the seriousness of Anunoby's injury.\n\nThe Knicks' health struggles provided openings for Indiana, and the Pacers initially took advantage of New York's inability to generate offense without Brunson. Powered by Tyrese Haliburton's bounce-back performance after a sluggish Game 1 and T.J. McConnell's sound playmaking, Indiana dominated the final 15 minutes of the first half, going on a crowd-quieting 56-39 run during Brunson's time in the locker room. The Pacers led 73-63 at the half.\n\nBut then, 54 years to the day that Willis Reed electrified the Garden by hobbling out of the tunnel just before Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals, Brunson tested the foot. Doing so prompted the roar heard all the way back inside the Knicks' locker room.\n\n\"It was really cool, but I just knew I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack in the second half,\" Brunson said of the MVP chants fans greeted him with.\n\n\"He's a warrior,\" said Knicks guard Donte DiVincenzo, who finished with 28 points. \"There was no doubt in my mind he'd be back.\"\n\nBrunson's presence -- and the Pacers attempts to trap him -- turned the tide of the game almost instantly. Within the first five and a half minutes of the second half, New York had already generated a 15-point swing to take a five-point lead.\n\nLike Game 1, it was a back-and-forth affair that wasn't without controversy. With the Knicks up 124-118, the Pacers pressured Hartenstein in the backcourt with just over a minute remaining. An official signaled that he was calling Hartenstein for a double dribble, which would have given possession to the Pacers. But then, moments later, the referees huddled and instead ruled it was an inadvertent whistle, giving the ball back to the Knicks.\n\nIt wasn't long after that Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was issued two technical fouls and ejected.\n\nThe decision to erase the initial double dribble call came one game after the Pacers were disadvantaged by an errant kicked ball violation. In the final minute of Game 1, with the score knotted at 115, Indiana's Aaron Nesmith tipped a pass with his hand before a referee blew a whistle to stop what could have turned into a Pacers fast break.\n\nWhen Carlisle and the Pacers complained late in Game 1, they were told the play -- a violation as opposed to a foul or an out-of-bounds call -- wasn't reviewable.\n\nStill, Indiana had its chances throughout Game 2, particularly with Haliburton (34 points, nine assists) looking more like himself, a slowed Brunson (29 points) finally looking mortal after a historic four-game run and Anunoby being forced to leave the game in the third.\n\nAnunoby appeared to plant his leg awkwardly during a transition layup, and Brunson was forced to commit a foul in order to stop play and get a substitution for him.\n\nIt was the latest ailment for a New York club that has dealt with them all season. One day before the Game 2 victory, backup center Mitchell Robinson had been ruled out six to eight weeks with an ankle injury, likely ending his postseason. That came one week after wing Bojan Bogdanovic had been ruled out for the rest of the campaign due to wrist and foot surgeries. And the team had already lost two-time All-NBA forward Julius Randle for the year after he dislocated his shoulder in late January.\n\nWith his team short-handed, Thibodeau was forced to play his starters massive minutes in recent weeks. Tuesday marked the fourth time Josh Hart (19 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists) has played all 48 minutes of a game this postseason, making him the first player since the Thibodeau-coached Jimmy Butler in 2013 to do so.\n\nIn Anunoby's case, he had averaged 46 minutes in the four games before Tuesday, the most he'd ever averaged over a four-game span in his career, according to ESPN Stats & Information.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Game 3 is scheduled for Friday night in Indianapolis.\n\nBrunson missed the final 15:32 of the first half with a right foot injury. The Knicks led 24-17 when Brunson exited, but they entered the second half down 73-63.\n\nBrunson drew a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden after leading the Knicks out for warmups prior to the third quarter.

MVP!\" when Jalen Brunson started to warm up again.\n\nThe New York Knicks guard, however, tried his best to block out the noise, and the pain in his body, to remain focused.\n\n\"It was really cool to hear, but I just knew that I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half,\" Brunson said on ESPN.\n\nThat worked as he eventually shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback, as the Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven play-off series.\n\nThe New York talisman gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot issue in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half.\n\nIndiana exploited Brunson's absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup.\n\nBut a limping Brunson - who returned at the start of the third quarter - led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the final period, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory.\n\nBrunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby had 28 points apiece.\n\n\"I mean, he's a warrior,\" DiVincenzo said of Brunson.\n\n\"There was no doubt in my mind that he'll be back. All season long, no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back. And we knew the severity of the game and everything, so we knew, everybody had confidence he was coming back.\"\n\nJosh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points.\n\n\"We found a way, that's it,\" added an exhausted Brunson.\n\n\"For us it starts with our habits - we've talked about doing the little things a little bit better, because you never know when they're going to help you in a big game.\n\n\"It's all about doing the little things well every single day, and we pride ourselves on that.\"\n\nThe victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic.\n\nAs well as the injury to Brunson, the team saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem.\n\nSomehow, the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth-quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm's length.\n\nKnicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed that the squad were uncertain of whether Brunson would continue after missing the second quarter, despite DiVincenzo's conviction that he would.\n\n\"We didn't know if he was going to be able to go or not, but he found a way to get it done,\" he said.\n\nTyrese Haliburton led Indiana's scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks' Hartenstein.\n\nHe took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" Carlisle said.\n\n\"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing.

Jalen Brunson never asks out of games, yet there he was, jogging down the court with 3:35 remaining in the first quarter and gesturing toward the bench, telling Thibodeau he needed to come out.\n\nThree seconds later, he was headed back to the locker room. While defending T.J. McConnell on a drive he'd felt something in his right foot. He didn't know what it was, only that it didn't feel right. \"Discomfort,\" is how he'd describe it later.\n\nThe Knicks led the Indiana Pacers by nine when he exited. Brunson remained in the locker room for the rest of the first half. His teammates were confused. Donte DiVincenzo didn't know where he went.\n\n\"Where's Jalen?\" Knicks wing Josh Hart asked a staffer behind the bench.\n\nWhen they joined him at the break, the Knicks trailed by 10. They looked to be on the verge of losing home court advantage in this second round series. The players still believed, but inside Madison Square Garden, where the energy had flipped from electric to anxious, it was clear the crowd did not.\n\nUntil five minutes remained in halftime. Suddenly, the fans who hadn't fled for the concessions roared. Brunson had emerged from the tunnel and was bouncing around, testing out his foot. Chants of M-V-P rained down on him as he shot free-throws. They reached his teammates back in the locker room.\n\n\"I had a decision to make,\" Brunson would say later, \"And I made a decision.\"\n\nThe Knicks blitzed the Pacers in the second-half Wednesday night, scoring twice as many points as them en route to a 130-121 victory. The win gave them a 2-0 series lead in this Eastern Conference semifinals. Brunson finished with 29 points on 11-for-18 shooting. The Knicks outscored the Pacers by 26 points in the 32 minutes he played.\n\n\"When he's out there, there's a level of calmness and a level of we're going to get the right shot every time,\" DiVincenzo said after the game. \"There's a level of confidence from everybody that we have him on the court with us, and everybody can settle down and play their own game.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the win, Brunson deflected when asked about the injury. He wasn't sure how the injury happened. What was he doing when testing out the injury at halftime? \"Testing it.\" How was he feeling now? \"I'm all good.\"\n\nEarly in the third quarter, that didn't look to be the case. Brunson spent large chunks of possessions camped out in the corner. He gave up the ball and passed up some hand-off opportunities from Isaiah Hartenstein. His burst seemed gone.\n\nHe found his legs as the quarter went on, burying the Pacers with an onslaught of jumpers. The Knicks, however, couldn't escape the quarter without seeing another rotation player go down. This time it was OG Anunoby, who had racked up 28 points, leaving with a hamstring injury. He didn't return. And this on the heels of the announcement that Mitchell Robinson, who entered the season as the team's starting center, would miss the remainder of the playoffs with an ankle injury, joining Julius Randle and Bojan Bogdanovic.\n\nThe Knicks had no update on Anunoby after the game. Can they really keep this run going if yet another key member of their rotation is forced to miss time?\n\n\"There's a blueprint here that Thibs has laid out,\" DiVincenzo said. \"Any game we play, as long as we defend, rebound and have low turnovers we can win.\"\n\nThe Knicks didn't defend well Wednesday night, but they took care of the ball and clobbered the Pacers on the glass. They were tenacious and relentless, rattling a young Pacers team and coaxing them into mistakes. They took their blows and plowed forward, like they have all season.\n\nBut it was the presence of their MVP which carried them home.\n\n\"Alright, Willis,\" Knicks wing Josh Hart called out in the locker room after the game as Brunson walked to his stall. There was more synergy to the reference than Hart might have realized.\n\nIt was on this date 54 years earlier that a hobbled Reed had jogged onto the Madison Square Garden floor for Game 7 of the finals to propel the Knicks to a title. Brunson returning for the second half of a second round series wasn't that.

Madison Square Garden was in true playoff form after Jalen Brunson knocked down a pull-up 3-pointer, right in Tyrese Haliburton's grill, to put the Knicks up 24-13 with 4:04 left in the first quarter.\n\nBut those positive vibes soon devolved into a state of profound concern. Oh, how quickly things went south for the No. 2 team in the Eastern Conference when Brunson -- who entered the night with four-straight 40-point games in these playoffs -- left the court with 3:32 left in the first quarter.\n\nThe Knicks' 130-121 defeat of Indiana in Game 2 was an emotional rollercoaster for everyone involved. Brunson's unsettling injury was just the start.\n\nMany inside the building feared the All-Star guard would not return. Rick Brunson, Jalen's father and a Knicks assistant, was not on the bench and that clearly was not a great sign. And the Knicks were already paper-thin, playing without Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson Wednesday night.\n\nBrunson was hip-checked by Indiana's Andrew Nembhard early in the first quarter, and from that point on, he was seen grabbing at his groin area as he made his way up and down the court. Some assumed that collision is what led to his early exit. However, late in the second quarter, the Knicks announced that Brunson had a sore right foot and was questionable to return.\n\nFans were rightfully petrified. As Brunson goes, so does this Knicks team. This is a guy that has been in the same conversation as Michael Jordan in recent weeks. Indiana outscored New York 39 - 56 without Brunson on the court in the first half and went into the locker room at halftime up 10. The Pacers went 10-for-19 from deep through 24 minutes of action and had 12 second-chance points. Haliburton matched Anunoby with 22 points.\n\nHowever, as the halftime festivities began to wind down, there was Brunson, slowly emerging from the tunnel with his chest out and head high. \"MVP\" chants began to reign down from the rafters as the guard began his warmup routine, knocking down one free throw after another, showing everyone inside Madison Square Garden that he was just fine.\n\nRegardless of how severe Brunson's injury actually was, it gave shades of Willis Reed, who was battling a torn right tensor muscle during the 1970 NBA Finals but emerged from the tunnel inside Madison Square Garden just minutes before Game 7. It injected his teammates with confidence and instilled doubt into Wilt Chamberlain and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nFifty-four years later, Brunson's return to the floor had a similar effect.\n\nBrunson started the third quarter, and with him on the court, the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 to take a 99-91 lead into the final frame. But the third quarter wound up extracting a heavy toll. Anunoby took an awkward step while driving to the rim on a fastbreak late in the period. He left the game and did not return.\n\nAt the start of the fourth quarter, the Knicks announced that Anunoby had a sore left hamstring. His 28 points scored on Wednesday were the most he had in any game this postseason and he finished one point shy of tying a season high.\n\nSo, no Anunoby for New York down the stretch, but Brunson was not about to let Game 2 slip away. He was once again at his best when his team needed him the most, pouring in 14 points in the fourth quarter -- including a floater over the outstretched arms of Indiana's Pascal Siakam with 41.9 seconds left to put the Knicks up 126-118.\n\nDespite missing the final minutes of the first quarter and all of the second, Brunson finished with a team-high 29 points in 32 minutes.

Indiana is a +145 underdog to even the series at one game apiece on Wednesday.\n\nOdds as of May 8 at BetMGM. Check out the available BetMGM promos before betting on Pacers vs Knicks today.\n\nThe Knicks, who opened as -245 favorites to advance in the series, improved to -360 after winning Game 1. The Pacers faded to +290. New York still trails Boston by a massive margin in the NBA conference odds, though. The Celtics are -310 to win the East while the Knicks are +320 second-favorites.\n\nJalen Brunson continued his assault on the playoffs in Game 1 of the series, dropping a game-high 43 points - his fourth straight 40-point game - on 14-of-26 from the field and a perfect 14-of-14 night from the free-throw line. '\n\nAs a team, the Knicks were phenomenal from beyond the arc, hitting 11-of-23 triples (47.8%) while connecting at over 50% from the field (44-of-82, 52.7%).\n\nThe Knicks also won the battle on the glass (40 to 32) led by another monstrous 13-rebound night from Josh Hart. No Indiana player finished with more than six rebounds.\n\nCenter Myles Turner had a team-high 23 for the Pacers, who finished with six players in double-figures and shot a solid 52.3% from the field themselves (and 10-of-26 from three, 38.5%).\n\nAll-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton continued to struggle. Haliburton, who is suffering from a back injury, scored just six points on 2-of-6 shooting from the field with eight assists, two rebounds, and four steals.\n\nNBA player props from DraftKings on May 8.\n\nOddsmakers just can't seem to set Jalen Brunson's point total high enough. The Knicks superstar has scored at least 39 points in five straight games and his over/under has increased from 35.5 in Game 1 to 36.5 ahead of Game 2. No Pacers player is over 19.5 (Siakam).\n\nUnfortunately for the Knicks, center Mitchell Robinson (5.6 PPG, 8.5 RPG) is out six-to-eight weeks with an ankle injury he suffered on Monday. Robinson played 12 minutes in Game 1, scoring two points with two rebounds.\n\nThere are no new injuries to report for the Pacers ahead of Game 2. Haliburton is once again listed as questionable for the Pacers due to his back injury.\n\nThe gap between these teams is infinitesimal, and on a neutral-court, I see Indiana as the better team. While the officiating certainly was questionable in Game 1, the Pacers can't pin the loss entirely on the refs. They showed their youth/inexperience down the stretch while letting their nine-point fourth-quarter slip away.\n\nBut the Knicks shot an unsustainable 47.8% from three in Game 1. New York has connected at a solid 38.1% clip from three in the postseason but shot just 36.9% from deep in the regular season.\n\nThe Pacers moneyline is as long as +162 at FanDuel, and I love the value on Indiana straight-up in what should be another hyper-tight game.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sascha_paruk@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Sascha Paruk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23208224.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1019, "textEnd": 1024, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

They finished with seven offensive boards vs. eight for the Knicks.\n\nIt's worth noting that Indiana also dictated the game's pace, as it has in three of the four meetings this season.\n\nAccording to the NBA's Advanced Stats, Game 1 had 98 possessions -- an especially high number for a playoff game and one that includes the Knicks, who ranked last in pace during the regular season (95.96).\n\nThis style of play suits the Pacers because they can turn to their bench and still not miss a beat.\n\nIndiana's reserves scored 46 points in the game compared to just three for the Knicks, whose bench ranked second-to-last in minutes during the regular season and holds the same position during the playoffs.\n\nThe Knicks are 2-2 against Indiana this season.\n\nThe average pace in the three regular-season meetings was 99.83 possessions per 48 minutes. Against the spread in those games, they own a 1-3 mark.\n\nThe Pacers are far from one of the better defensive teams in the league. They rank 24th in efficiency, with 117.6 points allowed per 100 possessions.\n\nHowever, they use an interesting strategy to ensure opposing teams play more to their style.\n\nIndiana is putting pressure on ball handlers as they dribble up the court. As a result, their opponents cross the half-court line much quicker, forcing them to get into their offense much earlier.\n\nThis constant pressure often results in more turnovers that can help trigger the Pacers' transition offense. The Knicks committed 15 turnovers in the series opener, which the Pacers turned into 22 points.\n\nThus, while the Pacers aren't known for their defensive prowess, there are still facets of their game that can be problematic for the Knicks.\n\nThe Knicks are playing a dangerous game if they continue to let Indiana dictate the game's pace.\n\nDefense has been one of their biggest strengths, but they can't seem to slow down the Pacers, even in a game where Tyrese Haliburton finished with just six points on 2-of-6 shooting.\n\nThe Pacers' point guard is simply too good to have such a quiet night again.\n\nIn both Knicks wins against Indiana this season, Jalen Brunson scored 40 or more points, including 43 in Game 1.\n\nThe Pacers' strategy should be pretty straightforward: Slow Brunson down and let someone else beat you.\n\nWhile that's undoubtedly easier said than done, it's their best option at this point.\n\nLook for the Pacers to make some adjustments in Game 2, and I wouldn't be surprised if Pascal Siakam, one of Indiana's better defenders, plays an increased role in defending Brunson.\n\nWith the style of play primarily favoring Indiana in these meetings, the visitors offer a ton of upside as five-point underdogs.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/turnerhartenstein--e1715119403551.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

With Brunson not on the floor, Indiana took full advantage by going on a 11-0 run in less than a minute to erase New York's big lead. The Knicks put an end to the run with a Precious Achiuwa dunk and after that both teams traded body blows in a fast-paced opening frame that ended tied at 36-36.\n\n-Tyrese Haliburton and Obi Toppin were the Pacers' big scorers in the first quarter with Haliburton, after scoring just six points in Game 1, putting up 13 while Toppin added 10, including three on free throws with 0.1 seconds left in the quarter on a poor foul by Miles McBride who was in for the injured Brunson.\n\n-Still without Brunson in the second quarter, New York had a tough time controlling the tempo of the game which played right into the hands of the high-powered Pacers' offense. Anunoby did his best to keep the Knicks within striking distance by tacking on another 10 points in the quarter, but Indiana continued to make shots and was up by as much as 11 in the quarter.\n\nIn the 15 minutes Brunson was out, the Pacers outscored the Knicks 56-39 and headed into halftime with a 10-point advantage at 73-63.\n\n-The start of the second half saw the return of Brunson which is exactly what New York needed, proving that, on the night that he came in fifth place in MVP voting, he really is the team's most valuable player.\n\n-Thanks to a couple of Donte DiVincenzo threes and a dunk early in the third quarter, the Knicks pulled to within seven points as their comeback attempt began. From there, New York went on a quick 14-0 run, stifling Indiana's offense and forcing turnovers in the process to grab its first lead since 10:09 left in the second quarter,\n\n-The Knicks outscored the Pacers 36-18 in the period with Brunson scoring 10 and showing little sign of his sore right foot. Their lead got as high as nine points and they never trailed again after retaking control.\n\nHowever, New York was without Anunoby for the last 15 minutes after he appeared to injure his quad on a fast-break play nearing the end of the third and was ruled out for the rest of the game. He scored 28 points in 28 minutes on 10-of-19 shooting from the field (4-for-7 from deep).\n\n-The Pacers played hard until the end, getting to within one point with 8:03 left in the game, but they were unable to stop the Knicks who had an answer every time Indiana got close.\n\nDiVincenzo made some timely threes towards the end of the game to keep the game out of reach and Brunson, as he so often does, took over in the fourth quarter by scoring 14 of his game-high 29 points even after missing 15 minutes.\n\nThe trio of Brunson, DiVincenzo and Josh Hart scored 76 points while Hart added a game-high 15 rebounds and seven assists.\n\n-Isaiah Hartenstein had a double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds and nearly had his first career triple-double by adding a team-high eight assists.\n\n-It's getting repetitive at this point, but even in a game where Brunson didn't play for a full quarter, he still ended up impacting the game in a huge way and scored 29 points with five assists and three steals. He ended with a game-high net rating of plus-26.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers play Game 3 on Friday, May 10 as the series shifts to Indianapolis.

He has scored 40 or more in four straight games, the first player to do that in the postseason since Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals, and is just the fourth player ever to do that.\n\nYet he insists he never goes into a game thinking about how much he needs to score, even on a Knicks team missing points from injured fellow All-Star Julius Randle.\n\n\"I think, what can you do, how can we be aggressive, how can we attack and where can we get the best advantage for our team,\" Brunson said Tuesday. \"And it has nothing to do with me saying I need to hit this amount of points, I need to hit this amount of shots. It's just, I'm reading how the game is being played and that's just my mindset and that's how it always has been.\"\n\nThibodeau first noticed it watching Brunson grow up, particularly when he became a high school star in Illinois while Thibodeau was coaching the Chicago Bulls. He has always been impressed by the way Brunson was never satisfied -- and still isn't -- and cares far more about team success than any individual accolades.\n\n\"I think that that's what makes him who he is,\" Thibodeau said. \"And right now this is what we need for us to win.\"\n\nBrunson has followed his first All-Star season by leading all players in postseason scoring with 36.6 points per game. The second-round pick in the 2018 draft had some big games in his first three seasons playing for Dallas, but as Carlisle noted, the Mavericks were Luka Doncic's team.\n\nThe Knicks signed Brunson in July 2022, and he has led them to two straight trips to the East semifinals after they hadn't won a playoff series since 2013.\n\n\"So when he came here, it was pretty clear right off the bat that Thibs just said, 'Hey, this is your thing,' and when you give a strong-willed guy like that the green light -- because Jalen, as aggressive a scorer as he is, is one of the great team guys I've ever been around in this league, or any sport at any level,\" Carlisle said. \"I mean, he's just really exceptional.\n\n\"Amazing things can happen for your team and a lot of bad things can happen for opponents. So hats off to New York for being able to sign him and he's been historically great here.\"\n\nTyrese Haliburton, the other All-Star point guard in the series, wasn't great in Game 1. The NBA's assists leader in the regular season, who has been bothered by back spasms, was limited to six points and eight assists for Indiana.\n\n\"We were playing ahead in Game 1 and feel like we should've won that game,\" Haliburton said, \"but at the end of the day it starts with me, and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nBrunson has the same expectation.\n\nDiVincenzo saw how much Brunson prepares while they were teammates for two NCAA championships at Villanova, and how he's able to solve opponents as games go on.\n\nIn Game 1, that meant passing to DiVincenzo for the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 40 seconds left, just as Brunson called someone else's number for the decisive shot in the first round when he passed to Josh Hart for a tiebreaking 3 with 25 seconds left in Game 6 against Philadelphia.\n\n\"He studies the game, he knows how teams are going to adjust and he continues to make adjustments himself,\" DiVincenzo said while sitting next to Brunson for their Game 1 news conference. \"He finds different ways to be successful.\n\n\"He's always had this, it's just now you guys are seeing it on this stage.\"\n\nPACERS AT KNICKS\n\nKnicks lead, 1-0. Game 2, 8 p.m. EDT, TNT\n\n-- NEED TO KNOW: The postseason record for consecutive 40-point games is held by Jerry West, who had six in a row in 1965. Bernard King, a Hall of Famer who played for the Knicks, also did it four straight times in 1984.\n\nSpeaking of playoff scoring, Reggie Miller will be part of the crew calling the game for TNT. Tuesday was the 29th anniversary of Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds to rally the Pacers past the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 East semifinals.\n\n-- KEEP AN EYE ON: The Knicks' bench, to see how often Thibodeau sends someone off it into the game. Indiana had a 46-3 edge in points from its reserves, led by T.J. McConnell (18) and Obi Toppin (12). Mitchell Robinson, Deuce McBride and Precious Achiuwa were so ineffective in their minutes that Thibodeau was forced to play Hart all 48, DiVincenzo and Brunson nearly 44 and OG Anunoby 42.\n\n-- INJURY WATCH: The Knicks ruled Robinson out for left ankle injury management. After having surgery during the season, he was injured again in the first round and missed a game against Philadelphia.\n\nHaliburton is listed as questionable again with lower back spasms. He had no points or assists with three turnovers in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"There were too many turnovers down the stretch for me and I have to be better,\" he said.\n\n-- PRESSURE IS ON: The Pacers, to defend Brunson without fouling. They sent him to the line for 14 shots in Game 1 and he made all of them.\n\n\"Look, he's really a great scorer, there's no question about that,\" Carlisle said. \"But situations where we're using our hands and we're reaching and fouling, we've got to look at that and see what's avoidable.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_mahoney@hjnews.com", "name": "Brian Mahoney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

After a back-and-forth matchup in Game 1 that saw the Pacers jump out to an early lead in the first half, the Knicks rallied in the second half thanks to a remarkable 43-point outing from Jalen Brunson.\n\nOn the flip side, the Pacers were hampered by a back injury to Tyrese Haliburton that put his status in question heading into the game. Now, with the Knicks eager to go up 2-0 and the Pacers looking to steal one on the road, the stakes couldn't be higher heading into Game 2.\n\nAhead of tonight's tip-off, which is scheduled for 5 p.m. Pacific Time (8 p.m. Eastern Time), let's take a look at injuries, starting lineups, depth charts and key matchups for tonight's pivotal Eastern Conference Semifinal matchup.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks Injury Report\n\nLeading up to Game 2, both the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks have submitted their injury reports to NBA.com. The league's report is published on their website every hour, with both teams submitting their injury reports as part of the 1:30 p.m. ET update.\n\nIndiana Pacers injury report\n\nThe Indiana Pacers will be without Bennedict Mathurin once more as the sophomore continues to recover from a labrum tear sustained in March. At the same time, Tyrese Haliburton's status is questionable due to lower back spasms. However, he will likely suit up.\n\nNew York Knicks injury report\n\nThe New York Knicks have three players listed on the injury report, with none coming as much of a surprise to fans.\n\nBojan Bogdanovic will be out after foot surgery, Julius Randle will be out after shoulder surgery, and Mitchell Robinson is out with an ankle injury sustained against Joel Embiid and the 76ers.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks Starting Lineups and Depth Charts\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nNote: ** Indicates player who is questionable or doubtful\n\nWednesday's Indiana Pacers vs. New York Knicks game will see several key matchups play out on the court. Most notable, of course, is the backcourt battle between Brunson and Haliburton, which is expected to deliver fireworks.\n\nShould Haliburton be able to play, the hope is that the two guards battle back and forth; however, as we saw in Game 1, Haliburton may not be at 100% for the game.\n\nFurthermore, the frontcourt showdown between Isaiah Hartenstein and Myles Turner has been worth watching. At the same time, Josh Hart and Pascal Siakam's performances on both ends of the floor have been entertaining to watch.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_bell@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Evan Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennedict_Mathurin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bennedict Mathurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/b7cc0-17151911742151-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers scored the first basket of the half to go up by 12, but then New York outscored them 36-16 the rest of the quarter to take a 99-91 lead into the final quarter.\n\nThe teams went back-and-forth in the fourth before Donte DiVincenzo delivered the knockout blow with a three-pointer to put the Knicks up 124-115.\n\nIndiana head coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the game.\n\nAnunoby missed the entire fourth quarter with a sore left hamstring.\n\nThe series now shifts to Indianapolis with Game 3 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Friday night at 7:00 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "fox59.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 59"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_nardiello@fox59.com", "name": "Phil Nardiello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/05/GettyImages-2152111380.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He has also surpassed Anthony for points in the playoffs as a Knicks player.

Brunson, on the other hand, is in his second Eastern Conference semifinals with the Knicks.\n\nNBA fans reacted to the stats about Jalen Brunson having more playoff points than Carmelo Anthony as a New York Knicks player.

Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks' Hartenstein.\n\nCarlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" Carlisle said. \"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing.

They did it again in Game 2, came all the way back the way Brunson came back after a first-half foot injury, managed to do that even though it's as if they've turned into a hockey team like the Rangers, and whomever they're facing the rest of the way is going to be on the power play.\n\nSomehow, though, they just keep coming. And their story got a little bigger Wednesday night, as Brunson continues to have a postseason for the ages, and one of the best any New York athlete has ever had.\n\nIt's why you started to get the idea Wednesday night that Brunson was playing on a broken leg instead of a sore foot as he rose up and his teammates rose up with him and the Garden rose up with all of them when the Knicks were taking the game back in the second half, and especially in a third quarter that was one of the great playoff moments any Knicks team has ever had.\n\n\"We did what we had to do,\" Brunson said on television when it was over, even though what he did to the Pacers in Game 2 felt more like another movie moment for him and his teammates.\n\nBrunson only played 32 minutes on this night after going to the locker room in the first quarter and then staying there the rest of the half. He still ended up with 29, would have had more if he didn't miss a couple of free throws at the very end, would have gone for 40 again if he'd played the whole game. Josh Hart did play the whole game, of course, all 48 minutes, 19 points for him and 15 rebounds, nobody on the Pacers close to a rebound total like that.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo? He went for 28 on Wednesday night, with six 3's. 'Nova Knicks against the world. With more than a little help from Isaiah Hartenstein, who started playing his pro ball in Germany and knocked around with the Rockets and Nuggets and Clippers and Cavs before becoming part of this wild ride the Knicks are giving themselves and Basketball New York right now. All Hartenstein did in Game 2 was score 14 points, grab 12 rebounds and end up two assists short of a triple-double.\n\nBrunson got hurt, came back. OG Anunoby, who was having his best playoff game Wednesday, maybe the game of his pro career considering the circumstances, grabbed the back of his leg in the fourth quarter and did not come back. Still the Knicks kept coming. Keep coming. As they continue to make Next Man Up not just another clich\u00e9 of sports, but their brand, totally.\n\nHow long can this go on as it really does seem the Pacers are going to be on the power play the rest of the way, especially with Anunoby hurt again? We are going to begin to find out on Friday night in Indianapolis, where so many Knick-Pacer basketball dramas have played out in the past. Once again, Brunson's words, they will all have to find a way.\n\nStarting with the Villanova guy having a New York postseason like this. For the ages, for sure. This 40-point run of his, one that absolutely would have continued if he didn't sit out as long as he did, has started to feel like Clyde Frazier's Game 7 on the night in 1970 when Willis Reed was the one to limp out of the locker room (36 points, 19 assists, seven rebounds), just every night. Clyde had that game with a title on the line. But for the Finals that year, No. 10 averaged 17 points and 10 assists. These days it really does feel as if No. 11 has now played eight Game 7's in a row.\n\nWhat Clyde did, what Mark Messier did, and Michael Strahan and Justin Tuck and them did to Tom Brady; what Reggie did in the '77 World Series and what Derek Jeter did in more than one October and the way Phil Simms played in a Super Bowl once -- those things happened in much bigger games than these, absolutely. The Knicks aren't even to the Eastern Conference finals yet. Still: What Brunson is doing right now, in the moment -- the moment being all that matters in sports, after all -- looks and feels and even sounds just as big.\n\nWe will see how the Pacers will respond now to having been smacked around in the first two games, and especially the way they got rolled in the third quarter Wednesday night. We will begin to get a sense in Indy, depending on Anunoby's health, if this whole thing can continue to be sustainable with a rotation for Tom Thibodeau that you could fit inside a shot glass.\n\nReally, we are going to find out if we still can get New York-against-Boston, one more moment out of the past and out of Knick legend, in the conference finals. We already know that as hard as the road there has become for the Knicks because of the injuries, it has just made the story they're writing feel bigger, and better.\n\nAnd everybody needs to appreciate what they are seeing, however long this all lasts, with as tough a Knicks team as the great Red Holzman ever coached, or Coach Riley, or Jeff Van Gundy. There have been better Knick teams than this, obviously. Two won titles and two since, in '94 and '99, fought for the title. This team still isn't anywhere near any of that, at least not yet.\n\nThese Knicks are still something to see. Were something to see again on Wednesday night when it looked as if the Pacers might even the series and sure did not. Brunson came back. His buddies Hart and DiVincenzo were waiting for him.

New York was already operating short-handed, having lost forwards Julius Randle and Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107; losing Robinson, too, meant Thibodeau was down to just seven players he'd entrusted with playing time in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Pacers on Monday.\n\nNew York scratched out a win in Game 1. But with three Knicks already averaging more than 41 minutes per game in the postseason, and against an Indiana team that goes nine-deep and both plays and gets shots up faster than any team in the NBA, each successive removal of a building block seemed to pose a greater threat to the structural integrity of Thibs' Jenga tower. At what point would the Knicks finally lose one piece too many, sending the franchise's best season in nearly a quarter-century crashing down?\n\nFor about 15 and a half heart-stopping minutes of game time during Wednesday's Game 2, it seemed like we'd found our answer.\n\nWith just under four minutes to go in the first quarter, Jalen Brunson closed out on a T.J. McConnell drive and promptly developed a bit of a hitch in his giddyup. After an Obi Toppin 3-pointer and the ensuing inbounds pass, Brunson looked over at the Knicks bench and waved for a substitution. This struck Thibodeau as rare.\n\n\"Yeah, well, the thing about Jalen: he never asks out of a game,\" Thibodeau said. \"So, you know, I knew that there was something.\"\n\nThat something took Brunson -- the fifth-place finisher in 2024 NBA MVP voting, the leading scorer in the 2024 NBA playoffs, the first player in NBA history to score 40-plus points and dish five or more assists in four consecutive postseason games -- off the Knicks bench and back to the locker room for the balance of the first quarter. A few minutes later, his father, Knicks assistant coach Rick Brunson, also departed the bench.\n\nThe radio silence inside Madison Square Garden was deafening.\n\n\"And then, when he didn't come back, you know, you just wait to hear from medical, what they say,\" Thibodeau said.\n\nWhat they said made an awful lot of hearts sink: sore right foot, questionable to return. The one guy the Knicks can't afford to lose -- the one who, during the regular season, was the difference between New York scoring like the NBA's second-best offense and its absolute worst -- was now in danger of being lost.\n\nSo, by the way, was the game.\n\nThe Knicks actually continued to score at a super-efficient clip without Brunson -- redirecting more play-initiating responsibility against Indiana's full-court pressure to Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo, running more of their half-court offense through center Isaiah Hartenstein in dribble handoff actions, and benefiting from the most aggressive offensive performance of OG Anunoby's four-month tenure in Manhattan.\n\nThe more pressing issues, though, came on the other end. Indiana's relentless commitment to cranking up the tempo -- pushing the ball down the floor off of missed shots, made shots, turnovers and just about anything else that can happen on a basketball court -- left the Knicks looking positively adrift:\n\nWith All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton putting his imprint on the proceedings by delivering a promised uptick in offensive aggression after a comparatively sedate Game 1, the Pacers scored 37 points on 22 second-quarter possessions against New York -- a blistering 168.2 offensive rating for the stanza, with 11 assists on 15 made baskets, just one turnover and six 3-pointers -- allowing the visitors to take a 73-63 lead into intermission.\n\nWhile the Knicks were struggling trying to get a handle on the Pacers' go-go offense in that second quarter, Brunson was with New York's training staff, trying to get a handle on whether he could go at all.\n\nSome Knicks didn't know if they'd get him back.\n\n\"We were going in thinking that we weren't,\" Hartenstein said.\n\nThey prepared as if they wouldn't have him.\n\n\"I don't know what we were down at halftime, but we're in the locker room like, 'We're going to win this game, still,'\" DiVincenzo said. \"'We've got to defend, we've got to rebound, limit their second chances, and then play our offense, not get outside of ourselves.'\"\n\nStill, though: They held out hope.\n\n\"I know that if he can go, he's going to go,\" Thibodeau said. \"That's who he is.\"\n\n\"All season long, no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back,\" DiVincenzo said. \"We knew the severity of the game and everything, so everybody knew he was coming back.\"\n\n\"I had a decision to make,\" Brunson said. \"And I made a decision.\"\n\nSerenaded by nearly 20,000 fans at a sold-out Madison Square Garden, Brunson strode onto the court, took some practice shots, moved around a bit, and decided to give it a go. That he did so 54 years to the day after Willis Reed hobbled out of the tunnel through a torn thigh muscle to spark the Knicks in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals was lost on nobody. (Brunson later acknowledged that he'd already fielded some jokes from teammates about the coincidence.)\n\nAs he began to push off and change directions, though, Brunson was thinking less about Knicks history and more about current events.\n\n\"I just knew I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half,\" he said.\n\nAfter a few dip-your-toe-in-the-water possessions where he operated off the ball, Brunson settled on a plan of attack: Take their heads off.\n\n\"When he's out there, there's a level of calmness -- a level of, 'We'll get the right shot, every single time,'\" DiVincenzo said.\n\nWhen the Pacers shaded extra help his way or tried to blitz the ball out of his hands, he just calmly hit his release-valve outlet -- primarily Hartenstein or Hart -- and trusted them to make the next pass or play to keep the possession humming:\n\n\"I'm sure Jalen has seen that coverage a thousand times, so they really know what to do,\" McConnell said. \"They cut and they get it to the guys that they need to, and they made shots out of it.\"\n\nAnd when they played Brunson straight up -- primarily with Andrew Nembhard, but really with anybody besides McConnell, who's been sensational on both ends through two games -- he just torched them with the shot-making that's turned him into one of the most dangerous scorers in the sport:\n\nBrunson joined Hart and DiVincenzo in playing the entire second half on that sore right foot, scoring a point per minute -- 24 of his team-high 29 points, on 9-for-16 shooting. If he doesn't come back, this series is probably headed back to Indiana tied at one. But he did. So it's not.\n\n\"The mental toughness piece is so important,\" Thibodeau said. \"The ability to get through things. To be at your best when your best is needed, even when you may not be feeling your best. That's who he is. He's a great leader.\"\n\nThat leadership might be about to face another test. After scoring 28 points in 28 minutes, Anunoby left the game with 3:27 to go in the third quarter after appearing to injure his left leg on a fast break. The Knicks later ruled him out for the rest of the contest with a sore left hamstring.\n\nThibodeau didn't have an update on Anunoby's status when he met with reporters after the game. If he's unable to go in time for Friday's Game 3, Thibodeau will be down to six players he trusts, plus the possibility of a couple of minutes for Alec Burks.\n\nHart has now played every second of the last 10 quarters the Knicks have played, and has gone the distance in four of New York's eight postseason games. Asked what would change if Anunoby's unavailable for Game 3, the ever-quotable Hart replied, \"I'm playing 48 anyway, dog. Ain't s*** change.\"\n\nDiVincenzo has averaged 45.1 minutes per game over the last three games, shouldering a greater complementary shot creation workload while also guarding All-Star Tyreses (first Maxey, now Haliburton) the length of the floor. Brunson was averaging just under 44 minutes per game in the playoffs before Wednesday, and played the final 24 straight on an injured foot.\n\nAnd yet: It's the Knicks who are dominating the offensive glass in the second half. It's the Knicks who are tightening up defensively, allowing nearly 14 fewer points per 100 possessions in the second half than they have in the first. It's the Knicks who consistently seem to hit first, second and third, and to come away with the loose ball or extra possession they need, exactly when they need it, even when they're supposed to be exhausted.\n\n\"Honestly, it's just the willpower. It seems like they really just wanted it more tonight,\" said McConnell, who termed it \"frustrating\" to see such a tightly curtailed rotation in which everyone's playing so many minutes still manage to be the aggressor late.\n\n\"We just have to try to continue to make things tough on them, and get them to exert as much energy as possible,\" he said.\n\nEventually, that has to matter. Eventually, whatever deposits the Pacers can put into the legs of the Knicks will pay dividends, because even tough guys get tired. Eventually, even warriors lose the war of attrition.\n\nUntil then, though: You give everything that you have. That's all you can ask of a player. And you can win a lot of games that way.\n\n\"There's a blueprint here that Thibs has laid out,\" DiVincenzo said. \"And no matter who is on the court, everybody follows that, and doesn't go outside of themselves. No matter who's in the game, we know what we're looking to get. Any game that we play -- as long as we defend and we rebound and we have low turnovers, we can win any game.\"\n\nThis is who the Knicks are; this is what they believe, and they'll keep believing it until proven otherwise. The Pacers haven't been able to dissuade them yet. Neither have the laws of biology, physiology or common sense. After all: What kind of sway does science have over a team that finds the magic in the work?\n\n\"Obviously, we wish we were healthy,\" Hart said during a postgame interview on MSG. \"But when one guy goes down, man, someone else steps up. And we've got more than what we need.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_devine@aol.com", "name": "Dan Devine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The Knicks currently own a 2-0 lead in the series after beating the Pacers 130-121 in Game 2. Indiana, meanwhile, looks to rebound back at home with the crown cheering them on. Both of our previous Knicks. vs Pacers simulations accurately predicted the outcome of both games. Does NBA 2K24 have what it takes for a three-peat?\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers Conference Semi Finals Game 3 Results According To NBA 2K24\n\nAccording to our NBA 2K24 Simulation, the New York Knicks will defeat the Indiana Pacers 115-98. After a sluggish first quarter performance, the Knicks bounced back and dominated for the rest of the game. The Pacers offense was unable to get things going, especially in the second and third quarters. Meanwhile, the Knicks enjoyed a solid offensive and defensive efforts.\n\nThe Pacers got off to a solid start, taking a small lead at the end of the first quarter. However, Jalen Brunson and the Knicks absolutely dominated for the rest of the contest. The Knicks managed to take the lead, and extend it by 14 as the third quarter ended. They never looked back as they made slight work of the Pacers in Game 3.\n\nIn terms of player performances, we feel Isaiah Hartenstein deserves the game ball after a spectacular double-double performance. Overall, he ended the day with 28 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks, 4 assists, and a steal. He accounted for almost half of the team's rebounds en route to victory. Additionally, Jalen Brunson had a great day, leading the team in points (29) and assists (10). The Knicks will need both of these guys to continue their efforts into Game 4 and beyond.\n\nAs for the Pacers, Tyrese Haliburton ended up being the only player to drop 20. However, it was a rough day for the All-Star, who only converted 9 of 21 total field goal attempts. The rest of the team didn't play better either, with no notable performances for the rest of the team. They'll need to make some serious adjustments if they even think they can come back in this series.\n\nAdditionally, check out some of the game stats:\n\nWith the win, the Knicks take a 3-0 lead in the series. It doesn't feel like a case of \"if\", but rather \"when\" the Knicks will win the series now. However, a strong victory in Game 4 means less risk of injury, and more time to recover for the next series. However, the Knicks still need one more victory, and can't afford to lose a game and keep the Pacers' hopes alive. We'll see if they can pull it off in Game 4.\n\nAs for the Pacers, things look beyond grim right now. The team desperately needs to find a way to contain players like Brunson and Hartenstein if they want to make things right. However, winning four games in a row, while also avoiding injury, is going to be nearly impossible. Do the Pacers have what it takes to turn things around in Game 4? We'll find out soon enough.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, we feel the score and stats feel pretty authentic. However, we always strive to make it more realistic. Whether this means adjusting lineups or CPU Sliders, we hope to create an authentic and enjoyable experience for you. Regardless, we also just had a blast watching the game\n\nOur biggest obstacle right now is accounting for injuries. We once tried to create custom rosters to account for injuries. However, this caused our streams to crash on multiple occasions. Therefore, we're trying to look for new ways to create more realistic lineups on game day.\n\nThat wraps up our Knicks vs. Pacers Game 3 Results according to NBA 2K24.

Indiana fell in Game 1 in Madison Square Garden, but they'll look to bounce back tonight just like they did in their first-round series.\n\nThe Knicks were excellent in the second half on the offensive end on Monday, so the Pacers will hope to improve on defense. That may require putting more attention on Jalen Brunson or being more focused on the glass. Either way, the blue and gold know what they need to do to win and get back on track in the series.\n\nLocation: Madison Square Garden, New York, New York\n\nWhere to watch: NBA League Pass, TNT\n\nSpread and Over/Under: The Pacers are underdogs as they are currently +4.5 in the SI Sportsbook. The over/under for the game is 222.5.\n\nPacers vs Knicks Injury Report\n\nThe Pacers listed Bennedict Mathurin (torn labrum) as out. Tyrese Haliburton (lower back spasms) is questionable once again, though head coach Rick Carlisle said he's confident Haliburton will play.\n\nThe Knicks listed Julius Randle (right shoulder surgery), Bojan Bogdanovic (left foot surgery), and Mitchell Robinson (left ankle stress injury) as out. They are all three out for the entire Pacers-Knicks series.\n\nKey Matchup\n\nAndrew Nembhard vs Jalen Brunson: The Pacers, like most teams in the league, struggled to contain Brunson in Game 1.

Madison Square Garden was in true playoff form after Jalen Brunson knocked down a pull-up 3-pointer, right in Tyrese Haliburton's grill, to put the Knicks up 24-13 with 4:04 left in the first quarter.\n\nBut those positive vibes soon devolved into a state of profound concern. Oh, how quickly things went south for the No. 2 team in the Eastern Conference when Brunson -- who entered the night with four-straight 40-point games in these playoffs -- left the court with 3:32 left in the first quarter.\n\nThe Knicks' 130-121 defeat of Indiana in Game 2 was an emotional roller coaster for everyone involved. Brunson's unsettling injury was just the start.\n\nMany inside the building feared the All-Star guard would not return. Rick Brunson, Jalen's father and a Knicks assistant, was not on the bench and that clearly was not a great sign. And the Knicks were already paper-thin, playing without Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson Wednesday night.\n\nBrunson was hip-checked by Indiana's Andrew Nembhard early in the first quarter, and from that point on, he was seen grabbing at his groin area as he made his way up and down the court. Some assumed that collision is what led to his early exit. However, late in the second quarter, the Knicks announced that Brunson had a sore right foot and was questionable to return.\n\nFans were rightfully petrified. As Brunson goes, so does this Knicks team. This is a guy who has been in the same conversation as Michael Jordan in recent weeks.\n\nHowever, as the halftime festivities began to wind down, there was Brunson, slowly emerging from the tunnel with his chest out and head high. \"MVP\" chants began to reign down from the rafters as the guard began his warmup routine, knocking down one free throw after another, showing everyone inside Madison Square Garden that he was just fine.\n\nRegardless of how severe Brunson's injury actually was, it gave shades of Willis Reed, who was battling a torn right tensor muscle during the 1970 NBA Finals but emerged from the tunnel inside Madison Square Garden just minutes before Game 7. It injected his teammates with confidence and instilled doubt into Wilt Chamberlain and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nFifty-four years later, Brunson's return to the floor had a similar effect.\n\nBrunson started the third quarter, and with him on the court, the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 to take a 99-91 lead into the final frame. But the third quarter wound up extracting a heavy toll. Anunoby took an awkward step while driving to the rim on a fastbreak late in the period. He left the game and did not return.\n\nAt the start of the fourth quarter, the Knicks announced that Anunoby had a sore left hamstring. His 28 points scored on Wednesday were the most he had in any game this postseason and he finished one point shy of tying a season high.\n\nSo, no Anunoby for New York down the stretch, but Brunson was not about to let Game 2 slip away. He was once again at his best when his team needed him the most, pouring in 14 points in the fourth quarter -- including a floater over the outstretched arms of Indiana's Pascal Siakam with 41.9 seconds left to put the Knicks up 126-118.\n\nDespite missing the final minutes of the first quarter and all of the second, Brunson finished with a team-high 29 points in 32 minutes. The Knicks were plus-26 with him on the court on Wednesday. Haliburton scored a game-high 34 points for Indiana with six rebounds and nine assists.\n\nBrunson's latest display of mental and physical toughness gave the Knicks a 2-0 series lead over the Pacers. Two more and the team will punch its first ticket to the Eastern Conference finals in 24 years.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Donte DiVincenzo saw it as soon as they became teammates in college.\n\nRick Carlisle witnessed it as Brunson's first professional coach -- and now has to figure out how to slow down a player on the longest scoring roll in the NBA postseason since Michael Jordan three decades ago.\n\nBrunson will try to help the New York Knicks take a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday in the only game on the NBA schedule.\n\nBrunson scored 43 points on Monday in the Knicks' 121-117 victory in Game 1. He has scored 40 or more in four straight games, the first player to do that in the postseason since Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals, and is just the fourth player ever to do that.\n\nYet he insists he never goes into a game thinking about how much he needs to score, even on a Knicks team missing points from injured fellow All-Star Julius Randle.\n\n\"I think, what can you do, how can we be aggressive, how can we attack and where can we get the best advantage for our team,\" Brunson said Tuesday. \"And it has nothing to do with me saying I need to hit this amount of points, I need to hit this amount of shots. It's just, I'm reading how the game is being played and that's just my mindset and that's how it always has been.\"\n\nThibodeau first noticed it watching Brunson grow up, particularly when he became a high school star in Illinois while Thibodeau was coaching the Chicago Bulls. He has always been impressed by the way Brunson was never satisfied -- and still isn't -- and cares far more about team success than any individual accolades.\n\n\"I think that that's what makes him who he is,\" Thibodeau said. \"And right now this is what we need for us to win.\"\n\nBrunson has followed his first NBA All-Star season by leading all players in postseason scoring with 36.6 points per game. The second-round pick in the 2018 NBA Draft had some big games in his first three seasons playing for Dallas, but as Carlisle noted, the Mavericks were Luka Doncic's team.\n\nThe Knicks signed Brunson in July 2022, and he has led them to two straight trips to the East semifinals after they hadn't won an NBA playoff series since 2013.\n\n\"So when he came here, it was pretty clear right off the bat that Thibs just said, 'Hey, this is your thing,' and when you give a strong-willed guy like that the green light -- because Jalen, as aggressive a scorer as he is, is one of the great team guys I've ever been around in this league, or any sport at any level,\" Carlisle said. \"I mean, he's just really exceptional.\n\n\"Amazing things can happen for your team and a lot of bad things can happen for opponents. So hats off to New York for being able to sign him and he's been historically great here.\"\n\nTyrese Haliburton, the other All-Star point guard in the series, wasn't great in Game 1. The NBA's assists leader in the regular season, who has been bothered by back spasms, was limited to six points and eight assists for Indiana.\n\n\"We were playing ahead in Game 1 and feel like we should've won that game,\" Haliburton said, \"but at the end of the day it starts with me, and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nBrunson has the same expectation.\n\nDiVincenzo saw how much Brunson prepares while they were teammates for two NCAA championships at Villanova, and how he's able to solve opponents as games go on.\n\nIn Game 1, that meant passing to DiVincenzo for the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 40 seconds left, just as Brunson called someone else's number for the decisive shot in the first round when he passed to Josh Hart for a tiebreaking 3 with 25 seconds left in Game 6 against Philadelphia.\n\n\"He studies the game, he knows how teams are going to adjust and he continues to make adjustments himself,\" DiVincenzo said while sitting next to Brunson for their Game 1 news conference. \"He finds different ways to be successful.\n\n\"He's always had this, it's just now you guys are seeing it on this stage.\"\n\n-- NEED TO KNOW: The postseason record for consecutive 40-point games is held by Jerry West, who had six in a row in 1965. Bernard King, a Hall of Famer who played for the Knicks, also did it four straight times in 1984.\n\nSpeaking of playoff scoring, Reggie Miller will be part of the crew calling the game for TNT. Tuesday was the 29th anniversary of Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds to rally the Pacers past the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 East semifinals.\n\n-- KEEP AN EYE ON: The Knicks' bench, to see how often Thibodeau sends someone off it into the game. Indiana had a 46-3 edge in points from its reserves, led by T.J. McConnell (18) and Obi Toppin (12). Mitchell Robinson, Deuce McBride and Precious Achiuwa were so ineffective in their minutes that Thibodeau was forced to play Hart all 48, DiVincenzo and Brunson nearly 44 and OG Anunoby 42.\n\n-- INJURY WATCH: The Knicks ruled Robinson out for left ankle injury management. After having surgery during the season, he was injured again in the first round and missed a game against Philadelphia.\n\nHaliburton is listed as questionable again with lower back spasms. He had no points or assists with three turnovers in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"There were too many turnovers down the stretch for me and I have to be better,\" he said.\n\n-- PRESSURE IS ON: The Pacers, to defend Brunson without fouling. They sent him to the line for 14 shots in Game 1 and he made all of them.\n\n\"Look, he's really a great scorer, there's no question about that,\" Carlisle said. \"But situations where we're using our hands and we're reaching and fouling, we've got to look at that and see what's avoidable.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sports.inquirer.net", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Indiana didn't benefit from last-minute officiating calls.\n\nIn other words, Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals went exactly as the Knicks and Pacers expected.\n\nSecond-seeded New York will look to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series on Wednesday night when it hosts sixth-seeded Indiana.\n\nThe Knicks earned a 121-117 win in Game 1 Monday. Donte DiVincenzo put New York ahead for good by draining a tie-breaking 3-pointer with 40.1 seconds left and just 12 seconds after Pacers guard Aaron Nesmith was erroneously whistled for a kicked ball violation.\n\nDiVincenzo, Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart, all of whom played on Villanova's national championship-winning team in 2016, combined to score 92 points for the Knicks. Brunson finished with a game-high 43 as he became the fourth player in NBA history -- along with Michael Jordan, Bernard King and Jerry West -- to score at least 40 points in four straight playoff games.\n\n\"He's the engine,\" Hart said. \"We're going to go as far as he goes.\"\n\nDiVincenzo, Brunson and Hart were especially effective in the fourth quarter, when they combined for 34 of the Knicks' 39 points. New York trailed 94-85 with 10:28 left before the trio scored the next 24 points for the hosts over a span of seven minutes.\n\n\"Go out there and just figure out how to win,\" Brunson said. \"We knew we had to play better tonight. They had our number for most of the night. We just made a couple plays down the stretch.\"\n\nThe Pacers acknowledged they were displeased with the officiating down the stretch but also lamented their inability to close out the Knicks.\n\nNew York shot 65.0 percent from the field (26 of 40) from the field in the second half, including 63.6 percent (7 of 11) from 3-point range. The Knicks shot just 42.9 percent (18 of 42) from the field in the first 24 minutes, including 4 of 12 from beyond the arc.\n\n\"It's right after the game -- I'm a little fresh and open with my emotions about it, but we know at the end of the day that we can't get into that position,\" Turner said. \"I think the Last 2 Minute Report, we're all looking forward to that coming out. There were two controversial calls.\"\n\nCrew chief Zach Zarba said following the game that the kicked ball call on Nesmith was incorrect. Replays showed Brunson's pass glanced off Nesmith's hand and toward Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard.\n\n\"On the floor, we felt that would be a kicked ball violation,\" Zarba told a pool reporter. \"Postgame review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal.\"\n\nDiVincenzo helped to ice the win with 12.1 seconds left, when he drew a moving screen against Myles Turner. DiVincenzo was defending point guard Tyrese Haliburton when he fell as Turner set a pick. The Pacers challenged the call, which was upheld.\n\n\"We're not expecting to get calls in here,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"It'd be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. So that's just the way it goes. I mean, we challenged it, they reviewed it, they got a bunch of people in New Jersey that agreed with them.\"", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_King", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernard King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/rth0cm/picture288390605/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/4272dd95-d5cf-4b1c-acbf-a98cdd50bcd7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

New York finished the first half down 10 points without their MVP, but Brunson led the Knicks to a 131-120 win.\n\nHis return and the result made many think back to one of the defining moments in Knicks history.\n\nIt was 54 years to the day when a hobbled Willis Reed walked onto the court in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals to help the Knicks win their first championship.\n\nNow, this isn't the NBA Finals, but Brunson's return ignited the Knicks' comeback to capture a 2-0 series lead over a very game Pacers team.\n\n\"That's such a big part of this franchise, and rightfully so,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said of the Willis Reed comparisons with a chuckle. \"The best part of Jalen is his humility. To be as humble as he is, on top of that, that's what makes him special.\"\n\nThe All-Star guard scored 24 of his 29 points in the second half and completely changed the tenor of Game 2 as the Knicks outscored the Pacers 36-18 in the third quarter.\n\n\"He's a warrior. There was no doubt in our minds that he'll be back. All season long, no matter what was thrown at him... he always bounces back,\" Donte DiVincenzo said of Brunson. \"We knew the severity of the game so we knew, everyone had confidence he would be back.\"\n\n\"I'm all good,\" Brunson said matter-of-factly of playing through his injury.\n\nBrunson did explain that he doesn't know exactly what caused his discomfort but after the trainers worked on him in the locker room, he made a decision to try and play.\n\n\"Once I went on the court I was going to give it a go, no matter what,\" he said.\n\n\"The mental toughness piece is so important. The ability to get through things. To be at your best, when your best is needed even when you're not feeling your best,\" Thibodeau said of Brunson. \"That's who he is.

He was initially listed as questionable to return, but Brunson gave it a go after halftime and was on the floor for the Knicks at the start of the third quarter. His return was the difference for the Knicks, as his 29 points led the way in their Game 2 victory.\n\nFortunately for the Knicks, Brunson said he was \"all good\" with the injury after the game. He did not sit at any point in the second half, so the on-court evidence supports his belief. Barring complications between now and Friday, he should likely be expected to suit up for Game 3.\n\nIt is unclear when exactly Brunson's injury occurred. At one point in the first quarter, it looked as though he had taken either knee-to-knee contact or had been hit in the groin. With roughly three-and-a-half minutes to go in the first quarter, Brunson, who was not moving well, looked as though he was asking out of the game as Josh Hart committed a transition take foul. Here's a look at the play leading up to that moment:\n\nBrunson is not only New York's best player, but he has been one of the best players in the entire postseason. He entered Wednesday's action as the postseason's leading scorer with 256 total points despite the fact that other players have played more games thus far. And Brunson made history by scoring 40 or more points in four consecutive playoff games.\n\nHe entered Game 2 ranked fourth in the postseason in assists with 60, and earlier Wednesday, he was announced as the fifth-place finisher for this season's MVP award.\n\nBrunson's presence would be critical to New York under any circumstances, but think about how injured this team already is. Julius Randle has been out for most of the season. Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson both suffered injuries that are expected to be season-ending during the postseason. OG Anunoby's status for Game 3 is up in the air after he suffered a Game 2 injury of his own. The Knicks have relied heavily on just seven players lately, and Brunson has been their only consistent generator of shots in the half court.\n\nThe Knicks were ahead by seven when Brunson left the game. Indiana took complete control of the game from there, and led by 10 points at halftime. That should give you an idea of just how important Brunson is to the Knicks. His health is paramount if they are going to sustain this postseason run.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The frustration became too much. With 33.9 seconds left in Game 2 of the Indiana Pacers' second-round series playoff game against the New York Knicks on Wednesday night, he walked over to crew chief Marc Davis and started clapping at him. It might have been over one seemingly bad call -- one more, at least, from his perspective -- or it might have been about nearly 96 minutes of them.\n\nCarlisle has kept a running tally. He counted 29 calls in Game 1 that he, and the Pacers, deemed incorrect. The NBA has a process where teams can file their complaints with the league, but Carlisle resisted. He didn't want to bring down a trickle-down effect on Game 2. The opener of this Knicks-Pacers series had been so close and so tight that the handful of decisions from referees in the final minute played an oversized role.\n\nInstead, he hoped, by keeping his silence, he might get a better outcome Wednesday.\n\nCarlisle began his postgame news conference with a 2 1/2-minute monologue about inequality in officiating in these Eastern Conference semis. The Knicks beat the Pacers 130-121 in Game 2, weathering another run of injuries, another key player lost and nearly the early exit of Jalen Brunson, their star. And still, they won.\n\nThat has put New York two wins away from the conference finals and left the Pacers on tilt. Carlisle devolved into conspiracy and complaints. The manifold issues that submarined the Pacers on this night fell by the wayside to conniptions about the referees. Monday, Carlisle said the officiating had not cost them the opener; it was 48 minutes worth of problems, not just a few calls down the stretch. That mask came off after Game 2.\n\n\"Small-market teams deserve an equal shot,\" Carlisle said. \"They deserve a fair shot. No matter where they're playing.\"\n\nIf this was a way of working the referees -- a coach's staple since whistles were wooden and any replay review was only available by word of mouth -- it was full-throated. Carlisle's grievances were long and loud.\n\nHe maligned the push in the back his star point guard, Tyrese Haliburton, received midway through the third quarter -- at the 5:08 mark to be exact, as Carlisle rattled off the timestamp -- and claimed it was already \"all over Twitter.\" He praised the Knicks' physicality and wondered why his Pacers weren't afforded the same leeway. He promised to file the missed calls he felt the referees made in Game 2 with the league office, knowing the Knicks would see his remonstrance.\n\nCarlisle had already announced one protest during the defeat's final minutes that had gotten him ejected after two technicals within nine seconds of one another. Instead, it was the slow burn before the jeremiad to come.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" he said. \"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing. So give New York credit for the physicality that they're playing with. But their physicality is rewarded and ours is penalized time after time. I'm just really disappointed. Just really disappointed. The two technicals, you gotta make a stand for your guys.\"\n\nThe qualms about officiating, however fierce, were just a shroud for the issues that actually impaled the Pacers at Madison Square Garden. They saw another chance to steal a game in New York slip away. Haliburton had 34 points and nine assists and it wasn't enough. Obi Toppin dropped 20 and outscored the Knicks bench all by himself, and it was in a loss. T.J. McConnell pestered the Knicks for 10 points and 12 assists and it was in vain.\n\nThe Knicks played the final 15:32 of the first half without Brunson, who went to the locker room with a sore right foot. They played the last 15:27 of the game without OG Anunoby as he tended to a sore left hamstring after scoring 28 points. They haven't had Julius Randle since January. Mitchell Robinson is out for the playoffs. Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 had surgery after Game 4 in the first round.\n\nYet, the Knicks kept reanimating; a whole team built of spunk and an adamantium skeleton. Brunson scored 29 points, with 24 coming in the second half. Josh Hart played 48 minutes again and dropped 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists. Donte DiVincenzo had 28. The Knicks shot 57 percent from the floor and outhustled the Pacers for loose balls and rebounds on repeat.\n\n\"It's frustrating to see a six-man rotation and guys are playing 40-plus minutes,\" McConnell said. \"We just, like I said, have to try to continue to make things tough on them and get them to exert as much energy as possible. But New York's a really good basketball team, really well coached and obviously in great shape.\"\n\nIndiana, the NBA's second-best offense this season, was outworked and outgunned. Its 10-point halftime lead disappeared quickly in the third, after being outscored by 10 in the second half of Game 1. The Knicks scored 130 points on 91 possessions - the 142.9 offensive rating was their third-highest all season -- and ran roughshod over MSG. The Pacers had played faster all season, had more depth, and better health, but were the ones who wilted again in the second half.\n\nAfterward, McConnell was the one lamenting the lack of energy for his team. It seemed almost inconceivable. The Knicks have kept losing rotation players and gaining strength. The long minutes have been empowering instead of draining. The Pacers have not been able to keep up. Not in transition and not on the boards.\n\n\"If we don't turn things up a bit, they can keep going,\" McConnell said. \"We've just got to be better as a collective, you know, energy-wise, protecting leads, and especially rebounding. You think you've got them boxed out, and they just keep going and going and going. We just have to flat-out be better.\"\n\nNow, the Pacers will try to solve their problems at home. Madison Square Garden had been uninviting -- even Reggie Miller, in the arena and on the TNT broadcast for Game 2, caught some strays -- but it wasn't the building that drove them mad, it was the energy-rich Knicks.\n\nIndiana was down 112-110 with 4:35 left but ran out of answers. Carlisle may have lashed out at the referees after the loss, but the Knicks' four offensive rebounds in that stretch played a larger role in his misery.\n\nIt has left Indiana searching. The Pacers nearly beat the Knicks in Game 1, winning a half by beating New York at its own game. They stayed close in Game 2 until the fourth quarter, but the Knicks ran them out of New York on their terms.\n\nHaliburton, unlike his head coach, had little acrimony for the officials. He pointed the fingers inward instead. He hoped for consistency from the referees, but, even more, he hoped the Pacers could have played better.\n\n\"We felt like we should have won this game,\" Haliburton said. \"Felt like we should have won last game. But I feel like the way playoffs work -- obviously it's only my second series -- but I feel like once you start to sit on 'Damn, we should have won that game,' it's gonna mess you up moving forward. Everything happens for a reason. I'm not really trippin'. We gotta be better in Gam3 and we will be better in Game 3. They always say series don't start until the road team wins; we're going back to Indy and obviously we love our chances there.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorkunov@theathletic.com", "name": "Mike Vorkunov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

New York held the game close midway through the second quarter. However, the Knicks were hit with a concerning Jalen Brunson injury before the end of the first half.\n\nJalen Brunson suffers untimely injury in Knicks-Pacers Game 2\n\nBrunson exited the game to the locker room with left foot soreness and was questionable to return, the Knicks' PR team announced on X. Thankfully, the star guard came out and warmed up with the team after halftime, per a video provided by ClutchPoints (h/t Steve Popper):\n\nJalen Brunson has been the heart and soul of the highly competitive Knicks. He struggled early during the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers but has since rallied to supply New York with a reliable flow of offense. The star guard has averaged a whopping 36.6 points and 8.6 assists through seven 2024 playoff games.\n\nBrunson was huge in the Knicks' 121-117 Game 1 win over the Pacers. He amassed a game-high 43 points, six assists, and six rebounds. If Brunson were to endure a hiatus, it would be a crushing blow to New York. Nevertheless, they have the personnel necessary to support Brunson and keep things afloat.\n\nJosh Hart has stepped up for the Knicks during the postseason. After averaging 9.4 points and 8.3 rebounds during the regular season, Hart leapt to 17.9 points and 12.4 rebounds through the first part of the playoffs. Moreover, he is shooting a blazing 44.7 percent on three-pointers.\n\nIf Hart can continue his jump in production, the Knicks can go far. Of course, Hart will not be able to do it by himself. Thus, Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby look to continue providing stout two-way support.\n\nNew York trailed by ten points going into halftime. Can the Knicks rally and go up 2-0 as Jalen Brunson returns to the court from injury?\n\nKnicks have a power that overcomes all odds\n\nNew York has a talented team on paper. After all, their squad finished the 2023-24 regular season with a 50-32 record, which allowed them to clinch the second see in the Eastern Conference playoff picture. Their 50-win season was the first since 2013. However, their team has intangibles that give them an edge.\n\nIf there is one thing New York will rely on to win outside of their play on the floor, it is team chemistry. After the regular season, Jalen Brunson revealed that New York was one accord, sharing a selfless, winning mindset.\n\n\"It's a mixture of the chemistry we have, a mixture of the coaches and how they want us to have a mentality,\" Brunson said. \"Guys just have that mindset. It's how most of us grew up as basketball players.\"\n\nSimilarly, Donte DiVincenzo emphasized that New York's locker room has supreme synergy.\n\n\"I think we genuinely like each other. It's not BS, it's not for the cameras -- I think everybody in this locker room likes each other and everybody in this locker room wants everybody else to succeed. That's the rarity here,\" DiVincenzo said.\n\nThings will not be easy against a fiery Pacers squad. Indiana wants to make it to the conference finals after their own solid regular season showing. Nevertheless, the Knicks look to use their chemistry and team play to keep the upper hand and prevail.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jalen-Brunson-leaves-Game-2-vs-Pacers-with-concerning-foot-injury.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

We're actually saying it because we believe it,\" Hart said late Wednesday after the Knicks engineered another short-handed win. \"There's a lot of guys on this team that can start (on other teams) in this league, so when we say it, it's not clich\u00e9.... We truly believe it's next man up.\"\n\nIt's hard to question Hart's sincerity after what happened on Wednesday.\n\nOG Anunoby left the game in the third quarter with hamstring soreness and didn't return. Jalen Brunson asked to come off the floor late in the first quarter due to foot soreness. He, of course, returned in the second half to help lift New York to a 130-121 win over the Pacers.\n\nIt was another \"I don't believe what I just saw\" night with these Knicks.\n\nBrunson scored 24 points in the second half on a sore foot. Hart played 48 minutes for the second straight game, giving the Knicks 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists. The Knicks beat the Pacers with their starting center (Mitchell Robinson) and starting power forward (Julius Randle) in street clothes on the bench and one of their rotation players (Bojan Bogdanovic) out for the season.\n\nThe Pacers outscored the Knicks by 10 in the second quarter. Brunson was in the back dealing with his foot injury.\n\nIt looked dismal from the outside. But internally the Knicks felt like they had enough healthy bodies to compete - with or without Brunson.\n\n\"We were in the locker room like we're going to win this game still. We got to defend, got to rebound, limit their second chances and play our offense. Not go outside ourselves,\" Donte DiVincenzo said. \"And that's exactly what we did. Whoever we have on the court, it's the same thing.\"\n\nThe next-man-up philosophy may be tested again later this week. Anunoby's status for Game 3 and beyond is uncertain. The Knicks will not practice on Thursday and will fly out to Indiana. They may have to face the Pacers on the road without their top defender and one of their best scorers in the postseason in Anunoby.\n\nIf you're a Knick fan, you're probably nervous about Anunoby's status for Game 3. It's reasonable, of course, to wonder how the Knicks can win games with yet another rotation player out due to injury.\n\nBut Hart, DiVincenzo, Brunson and the rest of the group don't share those concerns.\n\n\"I think there's a blueprint here that Thibs has laid out,\" DiVincenzo said late Wednesday. \"No matter who is in the game, we know what we're looking to get and any game we play - as long as we defend with low turnovers - we can win.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Donte DiVincenzo saw it as soon as they became teammates in college.\n\nRick Carlisle witnessed it as Brunson's first professional coach - and now has to figure out how to slow down a player on the longest scoring roll in the post-season since Michael Jordan three decades ago.\n\nBrunson will try to help the New York Knicks take a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday in the only game on the NBA schedule.\n\nBrunson scored 43 points on Monday in the Knicks' 121-117 victory in Game 1. He has scored 40 or more in four straight games, the first player to do that in the post-season since Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals, and is just the fourth player ever to do that.\n\nYet he insists he never goes into a game thinking about how much he needs to score, even on a Knicks team missing points from injured fellow All-Star Julius Randle.\n\n\"I think, what can you do, how can we be aggressive, how can we attack and where can we get the best advantage for our team,\" Brunson said Tuesday. \"And it has nothing to do with me saying I need to hit this amount of points, I need to hit this amount of shots. It's just, I'm reading how the game is being played and that's just my mindset and that's how it always has been.\"\n\nThibodeau first noticed it watching Brunson grow up, particularly when he became a high school star in Illinois while Thibodeau was coaching the Chicago Bulls. He has always been impressed by the way Brunson was never satisfied - and still isn't - and cares far more about team success than any individual accolades.\n\n\"I think that that's what makes him who he is,\" Thibodeau said. \"And right now this is what we need for us to win.\"\n\nBrunson has followed his first All-Star season by leading all players in post-season scoring with 36.6 points per game. The second-round pick in the 2018 draft had some big games in his first three seasons playing for Dallas, but as Carlisle noted, the Mavericks were Luka Doncic's team.\n\nThe Knicks signed Brunson in July 2022, and he has led them to two straight trips to the East semi-finals after they hadn't won a playoff series since 2013.\n\n\"So when he came here, it was pretty clear right off the bat that Thibs just said, 'Hey, this is your thing,' and when you give a strong-willed guy like that the green light - because Jalen, as aggressive a scorer as he is, is one of the great team guys I've ever been around in this league, or any sport at any level,\" Carlisle said. \"I mean, he's just really exceptional.\n\n\"Amazing things can happen for your team and a lot of bad things can happen for opponents. So hats off to New York for being able to sign him and he's been historically great here.\"\n\nTyrese Haliburton, the other All-Star point guard in the series, wasn't great in Game 1. The NBA's assists leader in the regular season, who has been bothered by back spasms, was limited to six points and eight assists for Indiana.\n\n\"We were playing ahead in Game 1 and feel like we should've won that game,\" Haliburton said, \"but at the end of the day it starts with me, and I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nBrunson has the same expectation.\n\nDiVincenzo saw how much Brunson prepares while they were teammates for two NCAA championships at Villanova, and how he's able to solve opponents as games go on.\n\nIn Game 1, that meant passing to DiVincenzo for the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 40 seconds left, just as Brunson called someone else's number for the decisive shot in the first round when he passed to Josh Hart for a tiebreaking 3 with 25 seconds left in Game 6 against Philadelphia.\n\n\"He studies the game, he knows how teams are going to adjust and he continues to make adjustments himself,\" DiVincenzo said while sitting next to Brunson for their Game 1 news conference. \"He finds different ways to be successful.\n\n\"He's always had this, it's just now you guys are seeing it on this stage.\"\n\nKnicks lead, 1-0. Game 2, 8 p.m. EDT, TNT\n\nNEED TO KNOW: The post-season record for consecutive 40-point games is held by Jerry West, who had six in a row in 1965. Bernard King, a Hall of Famer who played for the Knicks, also did it four straight times in 1984.\n\nSpeaking of playoff scoring, Reggie Miller will be part of the crew calling the game for TNT. Tuesday was the 29th anniversary of Miller scoring eight points in nine seconds to rally the Pacers past the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 East semi-finals.\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON: The Knicks' bench, to see how often Thibodeau sends someone off it into the game. Indiana had a 46-3 edge in points from its reserves, led by T.J. McConnell (18) and Obi Toppin (12). Mitchell Robinson, Deuce McBride and Precious Achiuwa were so ineffective in their minutes that Thibodeau was forced to play Hart all 48, DiVincenzo and Brunson nearly 44 and OG Anunoby 42.\n\nINJURY WATCH: The Knicks ruled Robinson out for left ankle injury management. After having surgery during the season, he was injured again in the first round and missed a game against Philadelphia.\n\nHaliburton is listed as questionable again with lower back spasms. He had no points or assists with three turnovers in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"There were too many turnovers down the stretch for me and I have to be better,\" he said.\n\nPRESSURE IS ON: The Pacers, to defend Brunson without fouling. They sent him to the line for 14 shots in Game 1 and he made all of them.\n\n\"Look, he's really a great scorer, there's no question about that,\" Carlisle said. \"But situations where we're using our hands and we're reaching and fouling, we've got to look at that and see what's avoidable.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Unfortunately, you also likely saw the dubious circumstances in which the game was ultimately decided.\n\nWhat happened between the Knicks & Pacers\n\nNow, before we begin, it would be pertinent to state that Jalen Brunson was phenomenal on Monday night when the New York Knicks met the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of their second-round NBA Playoffs series. In what marked his fourth consecutive game with 40 points, the Knicks' star was immense as he closed out the night with 43 points. There was also Donte DiVincenzo, who finished with 25 points and five 3s, as well as Josh Hart, who continued to show he's among the best in the postseason so far with 24 points, 13 rebounds, 8 assists, 3 steals and a block. Mention should also be made of Isaiah Hartenstein who put 13 points on the board, as well as OG Anunoby who also put up 13 points while sinking three 3s. In all the Knicks were well worth their win.\n\nYet, we simply can't go any further without mentioning the referees and the way in which they literally decided the outcome of the game. While we won't call them by name, you can go an take a look at who they are for yourself, there is no way to ignore the fact that the three of them were nothing short of terrible as the game came to a close. Indeed, it's hard not to say that in the final minute of the game, the refs effectively cost the Pacers what looked like a win.\n\nSo, what happened? We could refer to Brunson's check on Myles Turner which in turn allowed Tom Thibodeau to retain a challenge for later in the game, something that was key when it came to overturning a correctly called Brunson turnover with 22 seconds left in the game and a one-point deficit. We could also talk about the 'kicked ball' that wasn't when Aaron Nesmith clearly hit the ball with his hand with 52 seconds left and the scores tied. Why wasn't Indiana allowed to have a video replay review? Incredibly, crew chief Zach Zarba later admitted that the call was incorrect and moreover that kicked-ball violations can't be reviewed. What garbage.\n\nOK, so can the Pacers hope for better?\n\nWhether they can or can't, the reality is that the Pacers are now down 1-0 when it could be argued they should be up. To be clear, the above-mentioned situations were not the only examples of horrific officiating, but rather some of the more decisive ones in a night that was full of terrible refereeing. Consider for a moment that with a clear transition in progress during the closing moments of the game, the Pacers saw their clear steal given back to the Knicks, only to see DiVincenzo sink the game-winning 3-pointer just 12 seconds later. Yes, it's true the Pacers did get their own opportunity with 12 seconds on the clock and down by 1, but believe it or not, that was taken from them as well when Turner was called for an illegal screen that we're still trying to spot.\n\nThis is all to say that the NBA will need to answer some questions. It offends reason to think that there won't be some accountability following Monday night's game when we consider how blatantly wrong some of the calls were. Where the screen was concerned, there are those who will almost certainly argue that Turner was moving. On the other hand, it would be dishonest to refer to the decision as one that could have gone either way. No, what we saw was a screen that we see in every single NBA game and to that end is not normally called an 'illegal screen.' You can take a look below and judge for yourself, but we're betting you will agree that if it qualifies as 'illegal' we should see many more of those calls in any NBA game today, which we don't.\n\nThis brings us to the question of what comes next. Rest assured, this writer isn't the only one talking about the robbery that occurred on Monday night nor will he be the last. Truthfully, the league is going to have to answer some questions regarding officiation and that's before we touch on the idea that referees will be under intense pressure to do better when the teams meet for Game 2. Is this a situation where they should be cut some slack on the grounds of being human i.e., mistakes can be made? Absolutely not. Given what's at stake for all involved, there is simply no way to excuse what we saw in Game 1. How the NBA intends to address the situation remains to be seen, but if they don't then you can expect this to become a much more heated debate and one that will almost certainly get worse before it gets better.", "source": {"uri": "as.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "as"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_stier@as.com", "name": "Sarah Stier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "paul_rudder@as.com", "name": "Paul Rudder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/HK2I3A5VP3NUYLPID2Z5SE2R3I.jpg?auth=5fddbb8582ffcf9f5608e33e20cad304b207ae7dfc6e604d708a609ee48a7199&width=644&height=362&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

With his ears to the streets of New York, he gathered the sentiments of the people who have given energy to the franchise, sharing this from a couple of avid Knicks supporters:\n\n\"There may not be as much superstar talent as other teams,\" said a former Los Angeles Lakers fan who now roots for New York, \"but they make you want to cheer for them. I'm definitely a convert.\"\n\n\"This team is different,\" another supporter said. \"This is a team you like for a lot of reasons, but the biggest is Brunson. What an unbelievable story he is.\"\n\nBrunson has given the Knicks a level of success and a level of scoring that hasn't been seen since the days of Carmelo Anthony. Not only have the Knicks won 50 games for the first time since Anthony led their 54-win season in 2012-13, but they've also made it to the second round for just the third time since that same 2012-13 campaign. Brunson's 28.7 PPG is also the highest single-season average by a Knicks player since the Oak Hill Academy product averaged the exact same in 2012-13.\n\nUnlike the former 10-time All-Star, Brunson has the Knicks up 2-0 over the Indiana Pacers, while Anthony's Knicks lost to the Pacers in six games in the 2013 ECSF.\n\nBrunson most recently produced his fourth straight 40-plus point playoff performance, becoming the first player since Michael Jordan in 1993 to achieve such a feat.\n\nBeyond the numbers and the individual achievements, the Knicks have been fun to watch win. Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau has opened up their offense, allowing them to play faster and shoot better from outside. Their bigs bring tenacity, heart, and energy on the glass. Their wings attack in transition and shoot well from deep. Brunson comes through down the stretch of games, and most of all, the Knicks deliver with a 4-1 home record in this postseason.\n\nKnicks forward OG Anunoby reacted to the crazed fans by saying:\n\n\"There is nothing like it,\" said OG Anunoby, a forward who joined the team in January. \"It's electric. All of us, we feel it, and we love it.\"\n\nThe city of New York will continue to give life to the Knicks as they strive toward the Eastern Conference Finals.

Our betting picks look at Brunson's scoring prowess when handicapping Game 2, and seeing how his other markets might be affected.\n\nThe New York Knicks escaped with Game 1 on Monday night, slipping past the Indiana Pacers in the closing minutes thanks to a fourth-quarter comeback led by Jalen Brunson's 21 points in the final frame.\n\nMy Pacers vs. Knicks predictions expect value in Brunson's scoring trend continuing, but not necessarily in his points prop. In a close game, Brunson looks to score, and he handed out just one assist in the fourth quarter of that 121-117 victory.\n\nMy analysis\n\nJalen Brunson is certainly capable of spreading the ball around. He averaged 6.7 assists in the regular season and jumped that to nine per game in the first-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers. But in three of those games, he dished out seven or fewer.\n\nIn Game 1 of these Eastern Conference semifinals, Brunson had six assists despite the New York Knicks shooting 53.7% from the field and 47.8% from deep. That latter number should not hold up.\n\nIn the seven weeks to close the regular season after the All-Star Break, opponents shot 34.9% from deep against the Pacers, the 27th-ranked percentage in the NBA. Clearly, New York exceeded that and then some.\n\nWhat the Knicks did not exceed was the usual 3-point frequency rate against Indiana. Since the All-Star Break, opponents took just 33.1% of their field goals from deep against the Pacers, the lowest rate in the NBA. New York came in at 28% on Monday.\n\nIndiana does not give up looks from range, something the Knicks relied on in the regular season, and is an area ripe for assists. Without those chances, Brunson will not rack up assists before crunch time, and when the game is close late, he handles things himself.\n\nSome books have raised this prop to 8.5 assists with heavy juice on the Under. That is a safe bet, but the value is in the plus-money at Under 7.5.\n\nBrunson went 1-of-4 from beyond the arc in Game 1. Making only one three is worrisome, but attempting only four after averaging 7.3 attempts per game following the All-Star Break is more notable.\n\nThat is the Pacers defense. Looks from deep simply will not be readily available, so fading Knicks' 3-pointer props makes sense.\n\nYet, New York is a 5-point favorite and the atmosphere in Madison Square Garden should assure a 2-0 lead in this series.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Pacers are 5-1 against the spread as road underdogs of at least two buckets since the All-Star Break, including covering the +6 in Game 1.

It's been called a remix, but Game 1 put memories of the fabled rivalry on ice with an offensive explosion that the Knicks-Pacers squads of the 90s rarely achieved. The matchup in Madison Square Garden ended with a blazing 121-117 final score without any overtime.\n\nOne thing that felt familiar to anyone who's watched any Knicks games ever? The night didn't end without a little bit of drama, which we'll get into below.\n\nBut ultimately, Game 1 promised a thriller of a series, and tonight's game could keep delivering on the hype. Here's a look at the only NBA playoff game on Wednesday, with staff picks, odds and a preview.\n\nThe big headlines coming out of Game 1 of this series were, as they often are in the NBA playoffs, about the officiating. And yes, if you're a Pacers fan -- or a human being with eyes -- a late fourth-quarter moving screen call and a massive Donte DiVincenzo flop felt like a highly questionable decision for the final few seconds of a playoff game. That on top of a kick-ball call that the NBA's postgame report admitted was a mistake.\n\nYes, those were frustrating and shouldn't be happening in playoff games.\n\nBut to focus on the officiating is to miss some of the best storylines of that gritty, explosive Game 1. Unlike the Knicks-Pacers rivalry of the 90s, this matchup was all about the offense on Monday night -- the final score clocked out at 238 points in regulation.\n\nThe Pacers led for most of the game, looking fast and physical, but the Knicks simply outshot, outplayed and outlasted them in the fourth quarter.\n\nJalen Brunson, as expected, was the hero of the winning side, with not much on the Pacers side to match him. Brunson is on track to hit an NBA playoff record with his fourth consecutive 40-point game. He's perched up there with Michael Jordan (1993) and Bernard King (1984). Two more, and he'll tie Jerry West (1965) for the all-time record. He got 21 of those points in the fourth quarter, and the Pacers didn't have an answer.\n\nMyles Turner was the high scorer for Indiana, scoring 23 points. Three Knicks players had more than that. Tyrese Haliburton was held to just 6 points and two rebounds, though he had eight assists.\n\nBut here's the thing the Knicks have to watch out for: Only 3 of their 121 points came from their bench. The Pacers almost won that game, thanks to depth the Knicks just haven't been able to find. Almost 40 percent of the Pacers' points came from the bench. The Knicks can win a game, sure, but can they win a seven-game series? They have to figure out how to give their starters a breather, something coach Tom Thibodeau is not known to do.\n\nAnonymous NBA player poll 2024: LeBron or Jordan as the GOAT? Most overrated?

After the game, Brunson had a great reaction when his teammate Donte DiVincenzo emphasized that he had joined Michael Jordan on an NBA playoff list.\n\nWhile nobody is saying that Brunson is on Jordan's level, the Knicks guard is doing things that have not been done since the Chicago Bulls legend.

Already beloved in New York, Brunson could become a Knicks legend if this postseason run continues on the path it is currently on. It will not be easy for the Knicks to make it all the way to the NBA Finals, as there are some really talented teams remaining in the Eastern Conference, but this is a group that truly believes they can beat anybody.\n\nWith a star like Brunson, the Knicks have a chance in every game, and that has been on full display so far this postseason.

But I know if he can go, he's going to go. That's who he is. They worked on him, he warmed up, he said he could go, so he did.\"\n\nHart, like several of his teammates, thought nothing of Brunson asking off the floor.\n\nUntil his absence lingered all the way until halftime.\n\n\"In the second quarter, I looked and I think I asked somebody on the back of the bench,\" Hart recalled. \"I was like, 'where's Jalen at?' We stayed afloat while he was out, and he helped close it.\"\n\nThat's when Brunson emerged from the tunnel leading to the court during the halftime break. Fans clamoring for his return showered him with \"M-V-P\" and \"Ja-len Brun-son\" chants.\n\n\"This place has been nothing but special for me. I appreciate everything [the fans] do,\" he said. \"It was really cool to hear, but I just knew I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half.\"\n\nWith Brunson out, the Knicks floundered, the Pacers outscoring them, 56-39, to take a 10-point lead into the half.\n\nHe returned and played every minute of the second half to lead the Knicks to a 130-121 victory over the Pacers in Game 2, finishing a game-high plus-26 in his 32 minutes on the floor.\n\nThe Knicks outscored the Pacers, 67-48, over the final two periods. Brunson finished with 29 points on 11-of-18 shooting from the field and 3-of-6 shooting from three-point range.\n\n\"When he's out there, there's a level of calmness: We'll get the right shot every single time,\" said teammate Donte DiVincenzo. \"There's a level of confidence from everybody that we have him on the court with us. Everybody can settle down and play their own game.\"\n\nThe Knicks have been battered by injury this season.\n\nThey sustained another one on Wednesday when OG Anunoby limped to the locker room after pulling his left hamstring on fast break layup.\n\nAnunoby's uncertain status makes four key rotation players injured two games into the second round: Julius Randle (shoulder surgery) is out for the year, as is sixth man Bojan Bogdanovic (ankle surgery). Backup center Mitchell Robinson is also likely finished for the playoffs after re-injuring his surgically-repaired left ankle in Game 1.\n\nThe Knicks can sustain a number of injuries. They secured a victory against the Pacers despite Anunoby, their best defender, checking out with 28 points scored in 28 minutes.\n\nWhat they cannot afford, however, is losing Brunson, whose injury scare turned The Garden of Dreams into a forest of nightmares, and whose triumphant return saved a playoff run the Knicks hope can mirror their last trip to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2000.\n\n\"He's a great leader. I think the players all respect for that,\" Thibodeau said after the game. \"He goes out and he's willing to give whatever he has. That says a lot about him, and then when you look at what Josh has given us, you have great respect for that. It's saying a lot. To me, the actions say a lot more than the words. So it says you really care about your team and your teammates.

Brunson injured his right foot in the first quarter and came out with 3:32 to go in the first quarter having hit his only two field goal attempts at that point.\n\nThe Knicks were up 24-17 at that point but ended up having to play the rest of the first half without their best player and the fourth-leading scorer in the NBA this season. The Knicks still shot 58% from the field in the first half, but the Pacers really got going without him on the floor and outscored New York 56-39 the rest of the way to take a 73-63 lead at halftime.\n\nBut Brunson came back and helped turn the game around. The Knicks outscored the Pacers 36-18 in the third quarter to take control and Brunson had 10 points. In the fourth he kept rolling with 14 more. He still scored 29 points in 32 minutes despite the injury that cost him most of the first half.\n\nAnd as usual, Brunson's presence opened things up for the rest of the Knicks. Guard Donte DiVincenzo feasted on open looks and scored 28 points on 10 of 20 shooting including 6 of 12 from 3-point range. Wing Josh Hart had 19 points. O.G. Anunoby scored 28 points through three quarters before leaving with a hamstring injury. The Knicks outscored the Pacers 67-48 in the second half.\n\nTyrese Haliburton was far more aggressive than in Game 1\n\nWith 8:29 to go in the first quarter, Pacers All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton drove into the lane, put up a floater, missed it, but then grabbed his own rebound and hit a shorter floater.\n\nOn that possession alone, he took more shots inside the arc than he did all of Game 1.\n\nThat set the tone for a much more aggressive version of Haliburton, who scored just six points on six field goal attempts in Game 1, going scoreless in the second half with just one field goal attempt. In the first quarter alone Wednesday, he scored 13 points on 4 of 8 shooting. By halftime he already had 22, hitting 7 of 12 field goals and 5 of 8 3-pointers and also dishing out five assists. The outside shooting obviously helped, but he was more aggressive off the dribble which got the Knicks' defense scrambled.\n\nIn the second half he was less effective, but still finished with 34 points on 11 of 17 shooting for the game with nine assists.\n\nPacers starting frontcourt struggles\n\nThe Pacers have had a hard time getting everything to come together at once. While Haliburton's Game 2 was an improvement, the Pacers' starting frontcourt had a rough night all around.\n\nForward Pascal Siakam scored 14 points, but he was inefficient making just 7 of 18 field goals and also missing both of his free throws. Center Myles Turner had an even rougher night, scoring just six points on 3 of 11 shooting and grabbing seven rebounds. Forward Aaron Nesmith brought some defensive intensity as usual, but his shooting was off as he scored just six points on 2 of 7 shooting.\n\nT.J. McConnell got the Pacers' bench going\n\nThe Pacers were determined to dictate the pace in Game 2 and the bench was particularly effective in that regard, especially in the first half. Their wings spread the floor well and second-unit point guard T.J. McConnell whipped passes around on time and on target.\n\nIn the first half, the Pacers' bench outscored New York's 28-10. Forward Obi Toppin and guard Ben Sheppard each hit a pair of 3-pointers. Toppin had 13 points, Sheppard had eight and McConnell had nine first-half assists. Toppin finished with 20 points, Sheppard had 11, McConnell had 10 and 12 assists.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

That's all I got,\" Knicks wing Donte DiVincenzo said of Brunson postgame. \"There was no doubt in my mind that he'll be back. All season long, no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back. And we knew the severity of the game and everything, so we knew, everybody had confidence he was coming back.\"\n\nThe Knicks' Josh Hart and Isaiah Hartenstein celebrate during the game. Wendell Cruz/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n\nBrunson's return coincided with a dominant third quarter in New York's favor, who outscored the Pacers by 18 points across the period.\n\nEvery Knicks starter scored in double figures, with DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby adding 28 apiece. Josh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists, playing every single minute of the contest for the fourth time this postseason. He is averaging 46.8 minutes per game in the playoffs, which leads the league.\n\nIndiana was led by All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton - who bounced back from a poor Game 1 - racking up 34 points, nine assists and three steals in the losing effort, while former Knick Obi Toppin added 20 points off the bench.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers upset the Milwaukee Bucks in six games in the first round, though the No. 3 seed played the entire series without two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nThere was a contentious moment late in the fourth quarter when the game was whistled dead and Knicks big man Isaiah Hartenstein appeared to be penalized for a double dribble, though after discussion, the officials ruled that it was an inadvertent whistle and possession was returned to New York.\n\nIndiana head coach Rick Carlisle was infuriated by the decision and was eventually ejected from the game.\n\nCarlisle argues with an official as a result of the overturned call.

McConnell is the son of one of the most successful high school basketball coaches in Western Pennsylvania history in his father Tim and nephew to an Olympic gold medalist in Suzie McConnell-Serio, who won state championships as a girls' high school coach and led a college women's team to the NCAA Tournament and a WNBA team to the playoffs.\n\nBecause of that lifetime spent around coaches, McConnell knows very well the strategic motivation behind what Carlisle did in the waning moments of the Pacers' 130-121 loss to the Knicks on Wednesday in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals and what he did in his post-game press conference afterward. Carlisle drew two technical fouls and therefore an ejection in the last 45 seconds of the game for arguing with officials to the point that his assistants had to restrain him, then he talked at length in the press conference about the extent to which he did not believe the Pacers were getting a fair shake from officials this series. He went so far as to suggest that what he considers the discrepancy comes from bias against small-market teams in favor of the Knicks -- who play in the nation's biggest market -- and said the Pacers would be submitting clips to the league about calls they believe were unfairly adjudicated even though it means the Knicks will get to see them too.\n\nMcConnell knows this is what Carlisle thinks he has to do in his position to try to assure that the Pacers get a more favorable whistle going forward as they trail 2-0 in the series as it moves to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday at 7 p.m. at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. But as much as McConnell understands and appreciates the effort, and even may agree that the Pacers were deserving of more calls, he also recognizes that if the Pacers believed they had only lost Games 1 and 2 because of officiating, they'd be lying to themselves.\n\n\"We love Rick showing that type of energy on the court,\" McConnell said. \"It's unfortunate that he got ejected, but that's not the feeling we have in the locker room. We're not gonna sit here and blame officials. We gotta be better. It's just that simple. They smashed us on the boards again tonight and just brought more energy than we did. We gotta fix that.\"\n\nIndeed, for whatever disagreements the Pacers may have about the erroneously-called kicked ball and the questionable illegal screen in Game 1 or the overturned double-dribble or various non-calls against the Knicks in Game 2, they return to Indianapolis fully aware that they were outplayed and outhustled at Madison Square Garden by a team using a small rotation and playing its starters Ironman minutes. Veteran wing Josh Hart played the full 48 minutes in each of the first two games of the series, sharpshooting guard Donte DiVincenzo has been over 43 minutes and 40 seconds in each of the first two games and All-Star Jalen Brunson and defensive ace O.G. Anunoby would have been able to stay the same if injuries hadn't taken them off the floor for significant portions of Game 2.\n\nHowever the Knicks are the team playing as if they have fresher legs than the Pacers, who have used a nine-man rotation compared to what has mostly been a seven-man unit for the Knicks. The Knicks have gotten stronger, more physical and more relentless as the games have gone on. In Game 1, they outscored the Pacers 72-62 after halftime. In Game 2, they won the third quarter 36-18 and the second half 67-48.\n\n\"It's just the willpower,\" McConnell said. \"It seems like they really just wanted it more tonight with their energy, their crowd got into it. We just have to kinda pick it up in the second half because we know they can come in waves.\"\n\nIt may have felt like the Pacers were hit with a wave in the third quarter when Brunson returned after missing the final 3:32 in the first quarter and the entire second quarter with a sore right foot. He broke a string of four straight games of 40 points or more, but he still posted 29 points on 11 of 18 shooting with 24 points coming in the second half. As was the case in Game 1 when he scored 43, the Pacers couldn't keep him from getting to the rim or from getting at least decent looks on mid-range jumpers.\n\n\"He's one of the most elite at getting to his spots, sore right foot or not,\" said Pacers backup point guard T.J. McConnell, who guarded Brunson for part of the game. The guy is just a really good basketball player and obviously a tough cover for anyone in this league.\"\n\nThe Pacers started sending traps to try to take the ball out of Brunson's hands and he obliged by getting it into the hands of others. Putting two bodies on Brunson required sharp rotations to make sure others didn't get open shots and the Pacers did not get those sharp rotations, especially on sharpshooter Donte DiVincenzo. DiVincenzo hit 283 3-pointers this year -- the third-highest figure in the NBA -- at a 40.1% clip, so the open looks he got led to predictable results. He scored 28 points on 10 of 20 shooting, including 6 of 12 from 3-point range.\n\n\"It's something we gotta watch, something we gotta figure out obviously,\" Pacers All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \"He's getting a lot of those looks right now out of our rotations. We've gotta be better there. I missed one in that corner down the stretch. We just gotta do a better job of rotating. We're trying to throw different things at JB as best we can and just trying to scramble out of that and figure it out.\"\n\nThe Pacers had defensive problems beyond those. Prior to his hamstring injury, which could end up being a serious problem, Anunoby scored 28 points on 10 of 19 shooting including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. All six of his 2-pointers came within 2 1/2 feet of the rim, as he was having an easy time getting there either on drives, cuts or transition rim runs. Hart was again a problem with 19 points on 8 of 12 shooting to go with seven assists. The Knicks shot 57% from the floor for the game, scored 62 points in the paint and posted a gaudy 1.37 points per possession. They were particularly excellent in that third quarter when they made 14 of 21 shots including 4 of 7 3-pointers and posted 1.49 points per possession.\n\nBad defense led to bad offense in that quarter as the Pacers made just 8 of 24 shots including 1 of 7 3-pointers in the third. They scored at least 30 points in each of the other three quarters and shot better than 60% in both the second and fourth but those struggles were too much for the Pacers to recover from.\n\n\"In that third quarter we just missed a few looks,\" Haliburton said. \"I thought we played a little frantic. We just have to do a better job of not letting the rope slip when things are getting bad. We let that happen in the third quarter.\"\n\nAs McConnell said, they also let the Knicks dominate on the glass for a second straight game. It was an obvious point of emphasis coming into the series with the Knicks having led the NBA in rebounding percentage and offensive rebounding percentage in the regular season and grabbing a first-round best 37% of their offensive rebounds in their series against the 76ers. In each of the first two games, the Pacers won the rebounding battle in the first half only to be dominated after halftime.\n\nIn Game 1, the Pacers were up 24-21 on the boards at halftime and had given up just two offensive rebounds and three second-chance points. After the break, the Knicks won the rebounding battle 19-8 and turned six offensive rebounds into 13 second-chance points against the Pacers' two. In Game 2, the gap was even bigger. The Pacers were up 21-18 on the boards at the break with eight offensive rebounds to the Knicks' four and 12 second-chance points to New York's four. In the second half, the Knicks outrebounded the Pacers 26-13 with eight offensive boards to Indiana's six and 13 second-chance points to Indiana's 10.\n\n\"It's been a focal point for us that it's gotta be a collective effort on the glass,\" McConnell said. \"They keep working and working and working. You just have to give them credit. ... You think you have them boxed out and they just keep going and going and going. We just have to flat-out be better.\"\n\nAnd though they would like to have a whistle that helps matters at home for Games 3 and 4, they know that at this rate that won't be enough to save them.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we got outplayed,\" Haliburton said. \"We were right there to win the game. Would I like more consistency? Yeah, but let's not pretend like that's the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "T.

Looking at Knicks All-Star's status for Game 2 (May 8)", "body": "The New York Knicks have listed All-Star guard Jalen Brunson as available for the highly anticipated Game 2 of the Eastern Conference's semifinals against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.\n\nThe Knicks rallied from a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals at home.\n\nAccording to NBA advanced stats, during the regular season, the Pacers were the second-fastest team with a pace rating of 102.16, only behind the Wizards. In contrast, the Knicks were the slowest in the league, posting a pace of 95.96. This clash of styles is likely to continue defining the series.\n\nCoach Tom Thibodeau showed a reluctance to utilize his bench extensively, with four of the five starters logging 42 minutes or more in Game 1. With Robinson sidelined for six to eight weeks, Precious Achiuwa is expected to see regular playing time, and Alec Burks might also be added to the rotation.\n\nWhat happened to Jalen Brunson?\n\nJalen Brunson's injury concerns have been problematic this season. He injured his left knee in a collision with Isaiah Hartenstein during a victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 3.\n\nAlthough MRI results revealed no major problems, Brunson sat out the following game against the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThis incident came after he had already missed a game due to cervical spasms in his neck before playing the New Orleans Pelicans on Feb. 27.

That's all I got,\" Knicks wing Donte DiVincenzo said of Brunson postgame. \"There was no doubt in my mind that he'll be back. All season long, no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back. And we knew the severity of the game and everything, so we knew, everybody had confidence he was coming back.\"\n\nBrunson's return coincided with a dominant third quarter in New York's favor, who outscored the Pacers by 18 points across the period.\n\nEvery Knicks starter scored in double figures, with DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby adding 28 apiece. Josh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists, playing every single minute of the contest for the fourth time this postseason. He is averaging 46.8 minutes per game in the playoffs, which leads the league.\n\nIndiana was led by All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton - who bounced back from a poor Game 1 - racking up 34 points, nine assists and three steals in the losing effort, while former Knick Obi Toppin added 20 points off the bench.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers upset the Milwaukee Bucks in six games in the first round, though the No. 3 seed played the entire series without two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nThere was a contentious moment late in the fourth quarter when the game was whistled dead and Knicks big man Isaiah Hartenstein appeared to be penalized for a double dribble, though after discussion, the officials ruled that it was an inadvertent whistle and possession was returned to New York.\n\nIndiana head coach Rick Carlisle was infuriated by the decision and was eventually ejected from the game.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" he said after the game. \"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing.\n\n\"Small-market teams deserve an equal shot. They deserve a fair shot no matter where they are playing.\"\n\nThe series heads to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The New York Knicks' Jalen Brunson placed fifth in the voting. We humbly submit the following game with our petition for a re-vote.\n\nGame Two of the 2024 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals between the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers was tightly contested to start. After a duel between OG Anunoby and Tyrese Haliburton, the teams finished the first quarter tied at 36 points. With Jalen Brunson sidelined by a sore foot, the Knicks suffered a 17-point swing in the second quarter and trailed the Pacers 73-63 at halftime, despite 10 more points from Anunoby. Jalen returned to eviscerate the Pacers 36-18 in the third quarter, and although Indy gave a valiant effort to cut their deficit to one point in the fourth -- aided by an Anunoby hamstring injury -- the Nova Knicks took over in crunch time to secure the 130-121 victory.\n\nWe've exhausted our supply of superlatives to describe the greatness of Jalen. On one foot, he finished the game with 29 points, 24 in the second half. He had five assists, three steals, and shot 11-of-18 from the floor. The Knicks won by nine, and Jalen finished with a +26. New York takes a 2-0 lead as the series heads to Indiana.\n\nFor the Pacers, Haliburton finished with 34 points and bench player Obi Toppin added 20 points (7-of-10 FG).\n\nOG Anunoby had set a new playoff career-high of 28 points (on 10-of-19 shooting) in 28 minutes before hurting his hammy. Josh Hart logged another double-double, of course, with 19 points, 15 boards, seven assists, one steal, and a block. Played 48 minutes again. It's early still, but Josh Hart may be my Halloween costume.\n\nNot to be outdone, Isaiah Hartenstein recorded his own 14-point, 12-board double-double, and added eight assists. And Donte DiVincenzo shot 50% from the field and downtown, racking up 28 points.\n\nThe Pacers came out with a renewed commitment to defense, applying full-court pressure. Indeed, both teams worked hard for every bucket. New York made six of their first nine attempts to hold a slim 13-10 by midway through the quarter. The Knicks tried to get OG Anunoby going early and, aside from a missed dunk, he proved too tough for the visitors to handle. He led the Knicks with 12 points in the period while shooting 5-of-8 from the field.\n\nThe Knicks rode a 15-3 run to put some breathing room on the board. Indiana caught up on an 11-0 stretch of their own. The Knicks had shot 76% from the floor and 50% from deep. They'd be blowing out the Pacers if not for Tyrese Haliburton. The NBA's assist leader scored six points in game one but 13 in the first quarter tonight. The teams were tied at 36 after the first 12 minutes.\n\nAt 3:32 in the first quarter, Jalen Brunson subbed out and went to the locker room. He didn't play in the second quarter, and while we awaiting word about his absence, New York worked hard to keep the pace with Indy but suffered a 17-point swing. Anunoby did his best to keep New York alive, scoring another 10 points in the quarter to finish the half with 22. Equally relentless, Haliburton also racked up 22 by intermission.\n\nLate in the quarter, we learned that Brunson was questionable to return with a sore right foot. Coincidentally, the Knicks went down by 11 points. With under two minutes left, Donte DiVincenzo dropped five points to stave the bleeding. The ghost of Alec Burks checked in right before halftime to let Miles McBride take a blow. He bricked at the buzzer. Knicks down, 73-63. Yup, 73.\n\nBoth teams had scored 32 points in the first half. Indiana had the edge with second-chance points, 12-4, rebounds, 21-18, and assists, 19-13. New York had outshot the Hoosiers, 58% to 57%, but Indiana was cooking from deep making 10-of-19.\n\nUpon hearing that producer and musician Steve Albini died today, I told a friend that Albini's stubbornness was unmatched. I forgot about Jalen Brunson. Despite the sore foot, Jalen returned to start the second half. He looked perfectly fine dishing to DiVincenzo for this corner three.\n\nA minute later, Brunson was flattened by a Myles Turner offensive foul. Another minute later, he made a contested layup in traffic and smashed the floor. He hit the And-1 free throw. Durable? His skeleton is adamantium. With Jalen back, New York screamed on a 25-8 run to spin the Hoosiers' heads.\n\nThen Anunoby, sitting on a playoff career-high of 28 points, pulled up lame on a fastbreak with an apparent hammy issue. He limped to the locker room. Another essential Knick injured. . . . After surrendering 73 points in the first half, New York held Indy to 18 points in the third. With the crowd shaking the roof of the Garden, the home team brought a 99-91 lead into the final frame.\n\nThe TNT crew reported that Anunoby's sore hamstring had finished his night. Tom Thibodeau went small to start the fourth, with a lineup of Brunson, Deuce, DiVincenzo, Hart, and Precious Achiuwa. They fought hard, but a 10-3 Indiana run reduced their lead to a sliver. TJ McConnell was a nuisance to Jalen, and things got chippy between them. When Nembhard returns, however, all lights go green.\n\nCrunch time is when the Nova Knicks shine the brightest. Jalen and Josh hit timely buckets, then Donte hounded Haliburton and picked off his pass. DiVo swished a corner three, and Precious hammered home a dunk to give the Knicks a seven-point lead with 3:38 left.\n\nWith two minutes left, Haliburton hit two freebies to keep us sweating, but Donte swished another triple to get us screaming. Aaron Nesmith hit a three-pointer to make it a six-point differential. There was a contested double-dribble by Hartenstein that was overturned (and nearly caused Rick Carlisle to stroke out), Precious grabbed yet another clutch board, and Jalen humiliated Nembhard on this play to ice the game. Everything after that? Pure gravy, baby.\n\nThe Knicks have played eight playoff games, and I've suffered eight heart attacks. Game Three will be played in Indiana on Friday. Safe travels, Knickerbockers.", "source": {"uri": "postingandtoasting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Posting and Toasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_richardson@postingandtoasting.com", "name": "Russell Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

They are being led by guard Jalen Brunson, who is scoring from all three levels at will and is setting up the offense for his teammates. The Villanova product is averaging a team-high 36.6 points and 8.6 assists in the 2024 NBA playoffs. In Game 1, Brunson had 43 points, six rebounds and six assists. That was his fourth straight game with 40-plus points.\n\nForward OG Anunoby makes a huge impact when he's on the floor. Anunoby is an athletic two-way threat who is very disruptive defensively. The 26-year-old also soars to the rack and excels in transition. He logs 14.7 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game in the playoffs. On May 2, Anunoby tallied 19 points and nine rebounds. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy the Pacers can cover\n\nForward Pascal Siakam is the Pacers' most consistent scorer. The New Mexico State product pulls down his fair share of boards but can also knock down jumpers. He leads the team in both scoring (21.9) and rebounds (8.4).\n\nCenter Myles Turner has been an athletic interior presence in the frontcourt. Turner is a superb rim protector with soft hands around the lane. Additionally, the Texas product will stretch the floor with ease. He averages 19.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game in the 2024 NBA playoffs. In his last outing, Turner tallied 23 points, three assists, one block and made two 3-pointers.

The Knicks have been getting the ball to fall more lately as they've increased their point totals each of their last three games.\n\nThe Pacers are out to put a dent in the Knicks' postseason run, something the Pacers tried (and failed) to do on Monday. The Knicks secured a 121-117 W over the Pacers.\n\nThe Knicks' success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but Jalen Brunson led the charge by scoring 43 points along with six assists and six rebounds. That means Brunson has scored a third or more of the Knicks' points for five games straight. The team also got some help courtesy of Josh Hart, who dropped a double-double on 24 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nThe Knicks are winning the series right now, leading the Pacers 1-0.

The Knicks, who took Game 1, 121-117 by excelling in the finer details and navigating a peculiar finish, were looking to maintain their momentum.\n\nPacers' star Tyrese Haliburton was quick to dismiss any speculation that officiating was to blame for their crucial 130-121 loss in Game 2:\n\n\"They outplayed us,\" Haliburton said. \"Let's not pretend like the refs are the reason we lost. We just got to be better.\"\n\nThe New York Knicks took 22 free throws, making 18, while the Pacers took 17 attempts, making a subpar 10 from the line. Notably, the Knicks held an 81.8% to 58.8% advantage.\n\nThe Pacers committed 17 personal fouls, while the Knicks held an advantage here, with 14. Adding validity to Haliburton's outright dismissal of the officiating holding an unfair advantage.\n\nTyrese Haliburton improves in Game 2, but Indiana Pacers fail in the clutch\n\nWith Jalen Brunson temporarily sidelined, the visiting Pacers continued to press forward. Their passing was exceptional, particularly from T.J. McConnell and Tyrese Haliburton, and their 3-point shooting was highly effective. Haliburton hit a 3-pointer with 3:03 remaining until halftime, putting the Pacers ahead by 10. This prompted a timeout by New York.\n\nIndiana's offense remained hot as they consistently attacked the basket and created quality shots throughout the latter part of the first half. Their lead hovered around 10 points for much of that time, and they maintained their aggressive approach.\n\nBy halftime, the Pacers held a 73-63 advantage. Tyrese Haliburton led the team with 22 points and five assists. Their proficiency from beyond the arc was crucial in the first half; while the Knicks shot over 58.0% from the field through two quarters, the Pacers maintained a double-digit lead.\n\nHowever, every time the Pacers narrowed the gap to a single possession, the Knicks responded with a significant shot that energized the crowd. This pattern continued with approximately four minutes remaining when Donte DiVincenzo sank a 3-pointer to extend New York's lead to five.\n\nTheir advantage grew to seven with about 3.5 minutes left. Time was running out for the Pacers to mount a comeback, and they were finding it difficult to secure the necessary stops. Their defensive performance was lacking in the fourth quarter of Game 1 and appeared similarly inadequate in the second half of Game 2.\n\nThe Pacers managed to force two missed shots, yet the Knicks secured two offensive rebounds. With 53 seconds remaining and the lead in hand, the hosts scored during that possession to extend their lead to eight points, effectively sealing the Pacers' fate. The game ended 130-121 in favor of the home team.\n\nWith a 2-0 lead in hand, the Knicks travel to Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Friday for Game 3 of the series, where Tyrese Haliburton and Co. will look to claw their way back into the series on home court.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_sahai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tanay Sahai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Let's dig into our NBA picks for this Game 2 clash on Wednesday, May 8.\n\nMy analysis\n\nJalen Brunson is certainly capable of spreading the ball around. He averaged 6.7 assists in the regular season and jumped that to nine per game in the first-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers. But in three of those games, he dished out seven or fewer.\n\nIn Game 1 of these Eastern Conference semifinals, Brunson had six assists despite the New York Knicks shooting 53.7% from the field and 47.8% from deep. That latter number should not hold up.\n\nIn the seven weeks to close the regular season after the All-Star Break, opponents shot 34.9% from deep against the Pacers, the 27th-ranked percentage in the NBA. Clearly, New York exceeded that and then some.\n\nWhat the Knicks did not exceed was the usual 3-point frequency rate against Indiana. Since the All-Star Break, opponents took just 33.1% of their field goals from deep against the Pacers, the lowest rate in the NBA. New York came in at 28% on Monday.\n\nIndiana does not give up looks from range, something the Knicks relied on in the regular season, and is an area ripe for assists. Without those chances, Brunson will not rack up assists before crunch time, and when the game is close late, he handles things himself.\n\nSome books have raised this prop to 8.5 assists with heavy juice on the Under. That is a safe bet, but the value is in the plus-money at Under 7.5.\n\nBrunson went 1-of-4 from beyond the arc in Game 1. Making only one three is worrisome, but attempting only four after averaging 7.3 attempts per game following the All-Star Break is more notable.\n\nThat is the Pacers defense. Looks from deep simply will not be readily available, so fading Knicks' 3-pointer props makes sense.\n\nYet, New York is a 5-point favorite and the atmosphere in Madison Square Garden should assure a 2-0 lead in this series.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Pacers are 5-1 against the spread as road underdogs of at least two buckets since the All-Star Break, including covering the +6 in Game 1.

He was initially listed as questionable to return, but Brunson gave it a go after halftime and was on the floor for the Knicks at the start of the third quarter.\n\nIt is unclear when exactly the injury occurred. At one point in the first quarter, it looked as though he had taken either knee-to-knee contact or had been hit in the groin. However, he stayed in the game for a few minutes, and it seemed as though his hand, which is heavily taped, was the part of his body that was in pain.\n\nWith roughly three-and-a-half minutes to go in the first quarter, Brunson, who was not moving well, looked as though he was asking out of the game as Josh Hart committed a transition take foul. Here's a look at the play leading up to that moment:\n\nBrunson is not only New York's best player, but he has been one of the best players in the entire postseason. He entered Wednesday's action as the postseason's leading scorer with 256 total points despite the fact that other players have played more games thus far. And Brunson made history by scoring 40 or more points in four consecutive playoff games.\n\nHe ranks fourth in the postseason in assists with 60, and earlier Wednesday, he was announced as the fifth-place finisher for this season's MVP award.\n\nBrunson's presence would be critical to New York under any circumstances, but think about how injured this team already is. Julius Randle has been out for most of the season. Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson both suffered injuries that are expected to be season-ending during the postseason. The Knicks have relied heavily on just seven players lately, and Brunson has been their only consistent generator of shots in the half court.\n\nThe Knicks were ahead by seven when Brunson left the game. Indiana took complete control of the game from there, and led by 10 points at halftime. If Brunson can't play at his typical level, the Knicks might be too depleted to win this game or this series.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/fa5e003b-6bc0-4b7e-a92a-189aee7f08d0/thumbnail/1200x675/52fd2cd4d09d0f8a127b4ad0838864fa/brunson-getty-3.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

In only his second season as a Knick, he has cemented himself as one of the best players in franchise history, especially with his stellar play in the NBA Playoffs.\n\nBrunson has led the Knicks to back-to-back postseason appearances for the first time since 2012-13. The former second-round draft pick has developed into the franchise's first superstar since Carmelo Anthony and has surpassed him significantly. Brunson already has more playoff points at 591 for the Knicks than Anthony had in his seven seasons at 589 with the franchise.\n\nAnthony helped lead the Knicks to the postseason in three seasons during his tenure with the team. The farthest New York was able to get with Anthony as the lead player was the second round in 2013, but they were eliminated by the Indiana Pacers in six games.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 forward was a New York native born in Brooklyn and embodied the culture and atmosphere of the city on his back. However, the heart and grit that Brunson exudes on a nightly basis have elevated him as a fan favorite, while his performance has already created discussions surrounding where he ranks as a Knick all-time.\n\nESPN and MSG Network analyst Alan Hahn joined Get Up and gave high praise to Brunson not just for his performance in Knicks history but New York sports history.\n\n\"Jalen Brunson is the greatest closer in New York since Mariano Rivera.\"\n\nMariano Rivera is one of the greatest pitchers in MLB history, being selected to the hall-of-fame, and a New York Yankees legend. He helped lead the Yankees to five World Series en route to becoming a household name in New York. Rivera spent 19 seasons in the Big Apple, but what Brunson has been able to do in just two seasons is something which can't be taken for granted.\n\nBrunson Has Taken Over This Postseason Knicks' guard has put the NBA world on notice\n\nWhat Brunson has been able to accomplish for the Knicks is nothing short of incredible. He finished fifth in MVP voting in the 2023-24 season, is projected to make an All-NBA team, and has achieved this despite significant injuries to the team.\n\nThe Knicks suffered a huge blow to their team during the second half of the season as Julius Randle required season-ending shoulder surgery, sidelining the All-Star forward for the remainder of the season. The absence of Randle allowed opposing teams to focus on Brunson as the main source of offense, yet he's still been dominant, especially in the postseason.\n\nJalen Brunson 2023-24 NBA Playoffs Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStats\n\nPTS\n\n35.6\n\nREB\n\n4.4\n\nAST\n\n8.0\n\nPSA\n\n113.1\n\nUSG%\n\n38.4\n\nKey rotation piece, Bojan Bogdanovic, suffered an injury in the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers, which required season-ending surgery, eliminating another offensive weapon for the Knicks. The thinning roster of the Knicks forced head coach, Tom Thibodeau, to shorten his rotation further, which resulted in Brunson averaging 42.3 minutes in the postseason.\n\nThe stamina that the 6-foot guard has displayed is truly remarkable, including in Game 5 against the Sixers, in which he played 51 minutes. Despite the heavy toll on his body, Brunson has been an Iron Man for the Knicks, raising his performance as the stakes increased.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jalen Brunson (2024) joined Michael Jordan (1989) as the only two players in NBA history to total 285+ PTS and 65+ AST through the first eight games of a postseason.\n\nBrunson has been the main catalyst in propelling the Knicks to a 2-0 series lead over the Indiana Pacers in the second round of the NBA Playoffs. The former Villanova Wildcat is trying to lead the Knicks to their first Conference Finals appearance since 2000 and is only two games away from achieving that feat.\n\nIt has been a very long time since the Knicks have been considered true championship contenders in the NBA. The trajectory of the franchise changed once they signed Jalen Brunson, and in a short period as the lead guard, they have reaped the benefits of their decision. Regardless of how this season ends for the Knicks, New York has the perfect star to lead their franchise to the promised land.\n\nRelated Knicks May Have Stretched Their 'Next Man Up' Mentality, Anunoby's Hamstring, Past the Limit New York is piling up injured players, and O.G.

McConnell After Physical Game 2", "body": "The two point guards clashed in a wild second meeting in their series.\n\nHighlights The Knicks picked up a massive Game 2 victory over the Pacers, in large part due to second-half heroics from Jalen Brunson. Game 2 was not made easy for Brunson, as Pacers guard T.J. McConnell took the responsibility of guarding Brunson for long stretches. Brunson praised McConnell and his ability to defend in a post-game interview.\n\nThe first two games of this Eastern Conference Semi-Final series between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers have been close, physical and heavily impacted by point guards on both sides. The interesting part is that the point guard for the Pacers that's been competing the most with New York's MVP candidate Jalen Brunson is their backup point guard, T.J. McConnell.\n\nThe Pacers' All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton was a no-show in Game 1, attempting just six shots for the entire contest. In Game 2, Haliburton responded with a 34-point outburst, though it wasn't enough to lift the Pacers over the Knicks in Madison Square Garden, falling by a score of 130-121 in Game 2.\n\nOn the other hand, McConnell scored 18 points in Game 1, and kept his stellar play going while picking up star point guard Jalen Brunson full-court in Game 2. Brunson would still accrue a total of 29 points, five assists and three steals, unfortunately snapping his streak of four consecutive 40-point playoff games. The Knicks will still surely take his efforts from Game 2, as it did not look like Brunson would work his usual second-half magic after an unfortunate start.\n\nThis game saw Brunson go down with an apparent foot injury in the first quarter, keeping him sidelined for the entirety of the second frame. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Haliburton and company played their run-and-gun style of basketball to close out the first half, taking a 10-point lead into the back half of the contest. Haliburton scored 22 points in the opening half, and McConnell racked up an impressive nine assists, powering Indiana's fast-paced offense.\n\nIndiana Pacers 1st Half vs. Knicks - Game 2\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nPTS\n\n73\n\n3PT%\n\n52.6%\n\nTS%\n\n69.5%\n\nOFFRTG\n\n149.0\n\nIn the second half, Brunson returned from his injury. He would play every single minute from the beginning of the third quarter until the final whistle, scoring 24 of his 29 points in that period, providing timely baskets whenever the ball touched his hands. Although Brunson shined in his return, it was T.J. McConnell's mission to make life as hard as possible for the opposing point guard, harassing Brunson on defense and trying his best to force turnovers.\n\nOn one play in particular in the third quarter, McConnell once again picked up Brunson full-court, and Brunson took exception to McConnell's excessive defensive contact. Brunson would drive directly into the chest of McConnell twice, following it up with a high-arching shot off of the backboard for an and-one. After the game, Brunson acknowledged McConnell's defensive ferocity in an interview with TNT's Chris Haynes.\n\n\"Competing against T.J., man, it's something. I got a lot of respect, a lot of love for him. We're both competing, so that's that. I respect the hell out of him, really.\"\n\nThrough the entirety of the game, it was evident that McConnell was the best defensive matchup for Brunson. The Pacers tried to throw different bodies at the star scorer, but McConnell's fast feet and relentlessness visibly caused disruption for the Knicks offense.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, McConnell was giving the Knicks headaches with his quick drives to the basket and tough fall-away mid-range shots. McConnell's play-making was on another level in Game 2 as well, dropping 12 assists to go along with 10 points for a playoff double-double. Although McConnell's efforts weren't enough to help the Pacers pull out a win, receiving such compliments from an All-NBA caliber player after a hard-fought battle must help with motivation for Game 3.\n\nHow Can Indiana, McConnell Respond to Brunson's Scoring Output? Another battle between the two guards will inevitably lead to hard-nosed competition\n\nReturning to play in front of the home crowd could do a lot for Indiana in the series as they look to avoid an 0-3 deficit in the second round, a deficit no team has ever come back from in NBA Playoff history. One thing can be for certain in Game 3 for Indiana, and that's McConnell's laser-focus being trained to only Jalen Brunson.\n\nAfter seeing how Brunson easily took care of the Pacers' other options in guard/forward Aaron Nesmith and guard Andrew Nembhard, McConnell is surely their best option for guarding the All-Star. Even though McConnell is great at moving laterally and fighting over screens, Brunson still has a distinct strength advantage, easily being able to bump smaller guards out of the way on his drives to the rim.\n\nA major focus for the Pacers must be either walling off Brunson entirely when he drives, or to trap him from beginning to end, forcing Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo and Deuce McBride to make plays as scorers. The only problem with this, though, is that Hart and DiVincenzo in particular have put on amazing scoring performances so far this post-season.\n\nIf another thing is certain, though, Game 3 will be a slug-fest, with players like McConnell and Hart from both sides hustling for loose balls and making winning plays.\n\nThe Pacers take on the Knicks in Game 3 of their series on Friday, April 10 at 7 PM ET from Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indiana. National broadcast coverage is provided by ESPN.\n\nRelated Jalen Brunson Needed Just Two Years to Surpass Knicks Legend Knicks star has wasted no time in cementing himself among the franchise greats.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T.

There's no denying that. However, our NBA expert Jon Metler believes today's point total is a tad bit inflated when you consider the amount of basketball he's playing.\n\nJalen Brunson and the New York Knicks will be looking to take a 2-0 series lead in their Eastern Conference Semi-Final matchup against the Indiana Pacers, and we have searched through the NBA odds to find you our favorite Brunson player prop for Wednesday's game.\n\nJalen Brunson has been on an absolute heater in his last five games, scoring 39, 47, 40, 41, and 43 points. Brunson is the first player since Michael Jordan to score 40+ points in four consecutive NBA playoff games.\n\nAm I riding the heater or fading an elevated total on Brunson's points prop in tonight's Pacers vs. Knicks predictions?\n\nI'm not going to sit here and pretend like the Indiana Pacers have this unstoppable defense that will shut down Jalen Brunson and send him Under his points total. In all honesty, it's quite the opposite reason as to why I like the Under.\n\nThe Pacers have multiple holes in their defense that the New York Knicks can exploit, and they don't need to be 100% dependent on Brunson scoring and creating all of their offense. If they were playing the Minnesota Timberwolves, you would be looking to lean on Brunson because the other players on the Knicks would be struggling to generate offense, but that is not the case against the Pacers.\n\nWhether it's Donte DiVincenzo, OG Anunoby, Josh Hart, or even Isaiah Hartenstein on the interior, the Knicks have other advantages in this series. Scoring won't be the issue for the Knicks against the Pacers, and while they continue to give Brunson elevated minutes, they should at the very least look to lighten his workload and not have him completely carry the offense.\n\nBrunson plays 40+ minutes every night for the Knicks, which are extremely stressful minutes as he is consistently asked to put the team's offense on his back. Against the Pacers, Brunson shouldn't have to carry this heavy of a workload.\n\nThis total at 37.5 is also just way too high in my opinion. I mean, I don't care who you are, at 37.5, you seriously have to take a long hard look at the Under. Brunson has scored 39 points or more in five straight games, which has driven this total up from 31.5 to 37.5, and that's just a massive number. Yes, Brunson has been on fire, but at the same time, his points total has also benefited from these games being extremely close, which puts the ball in Brunson's hands for the majority of the fourth quarter.\n\nWhen I look at this total of 37.5 and I see a minutes projection of 44 minutes that still shows an edge on the Under, I just have to play it. Brunson could technically play 48 minutes, but if we still have an edge on the under 37.5 with a projection of 44 minutes, why are we not hitting the button? There's nowhere for this projection to go.\n\nBrunson is projected to score 35.3 points on Wednesday against the Pacers, which allows us to price the under 37.5 points at -158, but it is available at bet365 at -105.\n\nThere are multiple ways to play this with our SGP if it is based around the Under on Brunson's points prop. You could pair it with the Over on Brunson's assists prop and hope he is more of a creator of offense than hunting his own shot against this Pacers defense. But as our own Douglas Farmer wrote about in his best bet for this Knicks-Pacers matchup, which was Brunson Under on his assists total, I also just don't like this number for Brunson's assists total.\n\nThat being said, I'm going to build this SGP with the idea that Brunson's minutes are decreased and the ball gets pulled out of his hands in the fourth quarter. So I'm going Under on Brunson's points and his assists, and then an alternate spread of Knicks -9.5.\n\nBy pairing the alternate spread of Knicks -9.5 with both of Brunson's totals going Under, you create a very correlated scenario that could wind up in decreased minutes or even usage for Brunson, which would help both of these bets go Under the number.\n\nWe need something to disrupt Brunson's usage and minutes, and the game not being close in the fourth quarter could be exactly what we are hunting for.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/34ed94ee-e892-4ae4-af0d-290b13deab0e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Mitchell Robinson went down again and then there were seven.\n\nThe Knicks have been dealt yet another sizable medical blow as they continue their Eastern Conference Semifinal series against the Indiana Pacers, as Robinson will miss at least the next six week with a stress injury in the ankle that has bothered him all year. New York hardly has any time to recover, as they'll return to action against Indiana intent on taking a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven before things shift to Indianapolis.\n\nOfficiating controversies and Jalen Brunson heroics once again ruled the day for the Knicks in Game 1, as they escaped from New York with a 121-117 victory. Indiana took umbrage with several late calls (including a moving screen against leading scorer Myles Turner that killed off a potential game-winning possession) but that was hardly enough to bust Brunson's mastery, as the point guard joined elite company with his fourth consecutive game of at least 40 points (joining Jerry West, Michael Jordan, and fellow Knick Bernard King).\n\nWith a win tonight, the Knicks will have a 2-0 series lead in a round beyond the opener for the first time since they swept Atlanta en route to the 1999 Finals in part two.\n\nWhat: Indiana Pacers @ New York Knicks, Eastern Conference Semifinals Game 2 (Knicks lead series 1-0)\n\nInjuries, bad calls, even acts of the basketball gods will ultimately mean nothing if Brunson keeps up his actively torrid pace. The point guard, of course, cares about the main portions of the scoreboard, namely the \"home\" and \"visitor\" columns. With te Knicks poised to offer a heavier reliance on their outside game in the wake of Robinson's loss and perhaps avoiding the paint a bit if the refs adhere to the Pacers' complaints, Brunson has another major opportunity to push momentum to the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nIs/was Obi Toppin the ultimate difference-maker for the Knicks? Definitely not, and the Knicks rightfully traded him, as they could no longer afford to help write his redemption story. There's no denying, though, that they could use Toppin at the time like this, especially after he stepped up for a hobbled Julius Randle in last postseason's go-around. With a dozen in Monday's opener (two coming on a showstopping dunk), Toppin has now reached double-figures in each of his past five games. With depth becoming a bigger storyline, it stands to reason that the hype around Toppin's homecoming will likewise inflate.\n\n\"It's pretty cool seeing a guy who you thought you probably wouldn't be teammates with, let alone friends with, is now one of your best friends, and he's hitting clutch shots. It's a real cool sight to see, but knowing him and his mindset, he forgot about it once he woke up.\"-Jalen Brunson on Donte DiVincenzo (h/t Mike Vaccaro, New York Post)\n\nThe Knicks have overcome countess injury woes throughout this season and it's not like Robinson was the ultimate factor between a win or loss. Having said that, the Knicks lose a good deal of aggression and physicality with Robinson out and even more scrutiny on officiating will force them to be on their best behavior. There's no reason to believe that they shouldn't be able to win this series ... but Wednesday still feels like a little too much to ask for in the wake of what has transpired.\n\nPacers 116, Knicks 107", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_King", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernard King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5117,h_2878,x_0,y_69/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_knicks/01hxcv36ajvjn5mzwjw3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Isaiah Hartenstein had 13 points and OG Anunoby added 13 points and nine rebounds for the Knicks.\n\nMyles Turner scored 23 points, Pascal Siakam added 19 and T.J. McConnell had 18 points for the Pacers. Aaron Nesmith and Obi Toppin chipped in 12 points apiece and Andrew Nembhard scored 11 points.\n\nJalen Brunson (11) led the New York Knicks to a 121-117 victory over the Indiana Pacers\n\nBrunson dropped 43 points for his fourth straight playoff game scoring 40 points or more\n\nCelebrities attending - Top: Ben Stiller (L), 50 Cent (R) / Bottom: Rainn Wilson (L), Spike Lee (R)\n\nGame 2 is Wednesday night in New York.\n\nBrunson became the fourth player in NBA playoff history to score 40 or more points in four consecutive games. Jerry West reached that mark a record six straight times in 1965. Bernard King (1984) and Michael Jordan (1993) did it in four straight contests.\n\nWith the game tied at 115-115, officials called a kicked ball violation on Nesmith that on replay clearly hit the Pacers' forward's hand, not his foot. Officials after the game admitted that they made a mistake.\n\nDiVincenzo drained a 3-pointer to give the Knicks a 118-115 lead with 40.4 seconds remaining.\n\nIndiana pulled within one on Siakam's driving layup with 26.6 seconds to go.\n\nThe Pacers later had a chance to take the lead, but Turner was called for a moving screen with 12.7 seconds left. The Indiana center was bewildered by the decision.\n\nIndiana made another mistake when Nembhard fouled Brunson before the ball was inbounded. Brunson made the ensuing free throw, and New York kept possession.\n\nBrunson was fouled with 10.7 seconds to play and made two free throws to give New York a 121-117 advantage, and the Knicks closed it out.\n\nA controversial call at the end involved a foul for a moving pick called on Myles Turner (33)\n\nAfter the game ended, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle addressed the call of the illegal screen on Turner.\n\n'I don't want to talk about the officiating. We're not expecting to get calls in here. It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't.\n\n'That's just the way it goes. We challenged it. They reviewed it. They've got a bunch of people in New Jersey that agreed with them, so that's just the way it goes.'\n\nTurner addressed both calls when speaking to the media: 'I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game.\"\n\n'I think we're all looking forward to the Last 2 Minute Report coming out. I think there were 2 controversial calls. The kick ball by Aaron Nesmith was not a kick ball. You clearly see on replay.'\n\nSocial media reaction to the Turner foul favored the Pacers, despite the fact that officials reviewed the call and then stuck with it.\n\nSocial media reaction to that foul call favored the case of Turner and the Pacers\n\n'Yikes that whistle on Myles Turner.

The fast pace, high score and most importantly the bench play all favored Indiana. And the controversial ending has to have the Pacers eager to get out there and try to steal Game 2.\n\nLet's dig into this matchup and find some angles of interest for players and/or teams to outproduce expectation tonight.\n\nTyrese Haliburton over 16.5 points (-115): Haliburton had a poor performance in Game 1, scoring only six points on 2-of-6 shooting from the field with three crucial turnovers in crunch time. More than the numbers, though, he visibly wasn't aggressive, passed on several shot opportunities and looked indecisive. Health is the elephant in the room, with Haliburton dealing with lingering back spasms, but he reportedly stated several times on Tuesday his determined intent to play much better in Game 2. In the first round, Haliburton bounced back from a slow scoring start (10.5 PPG through Games 1 and 2) to average 18.8 PPG in Games 3-6. I look for that Haliburton to show up and put a nice number on the board tonight.\n\nT.J. McConnell over 10.5 points (-115): While Haliburton needs to bounce back, McConnell just needs to keep doing what he's been doing. In his last two games, he has come off the bench and played huge for the Pacers. He dropped 20 points and nine assists in 23 minutes in the closeout game against the Bucks, then followed that up with 18 points in 22 minutes in Game 1 against the Knicks. McConnell has brought energy in leading the second unit that changed the momentum of both of those games. And he has brought defensive intensity, generating seven steals over those two games and held Jalen Brunson to only 2-of-9 shooting when defending him 1-on-1. McConnell should have a big role again tonight and seems likely to outperform this line.\n\nJosh Hart over 12.5 rebounds (-125): Hart had an excellent all around effort in Game 1, scoring 24 points with eight assists, three boards and a blocked shot. But that is icing on the cake of his most consistent contribution: crashing the glass. Hart grabbed 13 rebounds in Game 1, the fifth time he's notched at least 13 boards in seven playoffs games. With the official news that center Mitchell Robinson is out for the foreseeable future, I expect Hart to continue his onslaught on the glass.\n\nKnicks money line (-175): The Knicks won Game 1 by four points in a game they were losing up until a furious comeback late. It was a high-scoring game, played at the Pacers' rhythm. The Pacers' second unit controlled the action, and against a Knicks team with only a seven-man rotation, it could happen again, which is why I'm not fully comfortable giving the 4.5 points in the spread. That said, I believe the Knicks are comfortably the better team, the Pacers don't have an answer for Brunson, the Knicks are playing at home and they've just shown a knack for winning close games down the stretch with Brunson acting as the closer. According to BPI, the Knicks have a 60.8% chance to win the game with a projected margin of 3.3 points.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Even on days where he looks like he's in for a bad night, he somehow finds a way to will the New York Knicks to victory in the 2024 NBA playoffs. On Wednesday night, in Game 2 of their second-round matchup against the Indiana Pacers, Brunson went off to a slow start, scoring five points in the first half as he was absent for the entirety of the second quarter after dealing with a right foot injury. But he shook off the pain and scored 24 second-half points as he led the Knicks to a 130-121 victory.\n\nBrunson's 29 point-night amid an injury scare was already admirable enough as it is. But when compared to his previous efforts, his Game 2 pales in comparison, even though he's quickly becoming a player whose mere touch of the basketball makes the opposing defense panic. Entering Game 2, the Knicks star guard had scored 40 or more points in four consecutive outings, becoming only the fourth player in NBA history to do so.\n\nNow, Jalen Brunson's scoring binge in this year's playoffs is allowing him to quickly climb the ranks of the greatest Knicks players of all time. In fact, Brunson has now scored more points for the Knicks in the playoffs than Carmelo Anthony did, as pointed out by ClutchPoints Twitter (X). With 591 points, Brunson now has two more playoff points for the Knicks than Anthony, even though Brunson isn't even done with his second season with the franchise.\n\nNow, games played is a better barometer of how impressive their scoring during their respective playoff careers for the Knicks actually is. Anthony, even though he spent six and a half seasons with the Knicks, only played in 21 playoff games. This was the case as New York failed to qualify for the postseason in the final four years of his stay with the team.\n\nMeanwhile, Jalen Brunson is already up to 19 career playoff games for the Knicks, and he's guaranteed to play in at least four more. He is averaging 31.1 points across that many games, allowing him to already surpass Carmelo Anthony on the all-time Knicks playoffs scoring ladder, and in this postseason alone, he has put up an average of 35.6 per night -- numbers that scream MVP.\n\nWhen the Knicks acquired Jalen Brunson in 2022, they were confident that they acquired a stellar up-and-coming player who recently emerged as the playoffs' main breakout star. But only a few could have foreseen how big of a star Brunson would turn into, and in only two seasons as well.\n\nBrunson has been a monster thus far in the playoffs, and he's dispelling the notion that the Knicks, or any other team for that matter, can't win a championship with him as the number one option. The 27-year old star is unstoppable, as his tight handles and precise footwork, not to mention his elite ability to change speeds, allows him to maximize his elite touch from all three scoring levels.\n\nAt present, Brunson is currently in 16th place on the all-time Knicks playoff scoring list. With the Knicks guaranteed to play at least four more games in the playoffs, Brunson could be all the way in 12th place if he averages 35.6 points (his current scoring average in the 2024 NBA playoffs) during those contests. If the Knicks can make it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, he could be in the top-10 before the playoffs end. If that doesn't scream greatness, nothing will.\n\nCarmelo Anthony's stint with the Knicks -- a disappointment?\n\nThe Knicks traded for Carmelo Anthony in 2011 as they looked to bolster their roster that was built around Amar'e Stoudemire. However, Stoudemire was already on the verge of physically breaking down in the 2011 playoffs. Despite putting up stellar numbers in the regular season, Stoudemire struggled immensely in the playoffs as the Knicks were swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nBy 2012, Anthony did not have much in the way of superstar-level help, although the Knicks managed to unearth Jeremy Lin and the addition of Tyson Chandler propped up the team's defense. Alas, the Knicks ran into the eventual champion Miami Heat, a hungry team led by a resurgent LeBron James who was raring to avenge his defeat in the 2011 NBA Finals, and lost in five games in the first round.\n\nCarmelo Anthony's third go-round in the postseason was his best shot at competing in a Knicks uniform. The roster the Knicks put together was a bit old, but they had quality players at every position, negating the effect of Amar'e Stoudemire's steep decline. New York focused on a spread-out offense, with gunners such as JR Smith, Steve Novak, and Chris Copeland thriving, and Anthony made the most of the spacing the team had en route to a career year.\n\nThe team also had plenty of leadership, with Jason Kidd, Rasheed Wallace, Marcus Camby, Kurt Thomas, and Pablo Prigioni all being steadying presences in the Knicks locker room. They won 54 games and advanced to the second round of the playoffs, running into the Indiana Pacers in the process.\n\nKnicks fans all know what happened next; in a must-win Game 6, Roy Hibbert swatted a dunk attempt from Anthony and turned momentum towards the Pacers' favor. Just like that, New York's playoff run came to an end, they wouldn't return to the postseason until 2021.\n\nThe Knicks front office made plenty of errors following that fateful 2013 playoff run that it took years for them to recover. Phil Jackson's stint as the team's president of basketball operations still make fans wake up with cold sweat.\n\nThe decision to trade for Andrea Bargnani quickly backfired, the team's decision to acquire Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose in the same offseason didn't build the \"superteam\" the Knicks had envisioned, and trading Kristaps Porzingis, their best draft pick in a while, sat as well as one would think with a fanbase that was begging for a chance to support a winning team.\n\nCarmelo Anthony had a bit of a part to play in the way the Knicks failed to emerge as a championship contender, or even a consistent playoff team, during his six and a half-year stint in the Big Apple. But the team failed him on an even greater scale as they seemed to choose the worst decision at every stop before the team traded him away in 2017.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar'e_Stoudemire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amar'e Stoudemire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2011 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Camby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Camby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Bargnani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Bargnani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Chandler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Chandler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Copeland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Copeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Prigioni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pablo Prigioni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasheed Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hibbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Hibbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Novak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Novak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Lin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Lin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

On Tuesday, the NBA's Last Two Minute Report confirmed the Pacers' initial suspicion that it was an incorrect call, but Indiana couldn't have done anything about it because kicked ball violations are not reviewable, a fact Pacers coach Rick Carlisle admitted he knew following the game.\n\nFour possessions later, with the Pacers down one with 18.4 seconds remaining, officials called an offensive foul on Myles Turner for an illegal screen in a pick-and-roll with Tyrese Haliburton. That play was reviewable, so Carlisle asked for a challenge, but the NBA's replay officials in Secaucus, N.J. confirmed the call. (The Last Two Minute Report confirmed that call as well on Tuesday.)\n\nIn both situations, the Knicks made a positive play following a controversial call.\n\nFollowing the game, it would have been easy to suggest both moments swung the game in New York's favor, but Carlisle was not interested in doing such a thing. Instead, the 22-year NBA veteran head coach, who has won 943 regular-season games and another 67 playoff games, focused on what his team could have done better throughout the game to come away with a win.\n\n\"There's so many events in an NBA game,\" Carlisle said. \"They're always a sharp focus on the last minute, but there were things that happened with five or six minutes left that really hurt us. We had one play where one of our guys took a wild run to try to gamble and steal the ball, and it turned into a four-point play for them. I think we had a five-point lead at the time, and so, it's not just the last minute or two. It's a whole game. The whole fourth quarter.\n\n\"So this is a great experience for our guys. It comes at a cost. It's so fun. But we're gonna have to learn some things for Game 2.\"\n\nThis was the fourth-quarter play Carlisle was emphasizing in his postgame press conference:\n\nRather than focusing on his defensive assignment, Nesmith tried to sneak up on Isaiah Hartenstein and force the Knicks center into a turnover as he brought the ball up. Instead, Hartenstein saw the trap coming and dished it back to Hart, who ran down an open lane to the rim and drew a foul on Turner.\n\nThe Pacers may still have given up a bucket on that possession if Nesmith had just gotten back in transition and defended Hart in a half-court setting, but Nesmith's overzealous defensive approach created an easy offensive opportunity for Hart.\n\nAs Carlisle emphasized in his postgame press conference, the Pacers will be much better served focusing on things they can control before Game 2 rather than complaining about officiating or wasting time trying to prove something could have changed with a different call.\n\nLooking at the film from Game 1, here are three things that stand out heading into Game 2:\n\nThe Pacers know Hart. Offensively this season, as a team they wreaked havoc on the league doing what Hart does as an individual player.\n\nAs a team that pushes the tempo in every game, they know how difficult it is for opponents to deal with a squad that looks for transition opportunities every possible moment. While it remains to be seen if Hart is going to play all 48 minutes of every game in this series as he did in Game 1, the Pacers need to do a better job remembering that he will push the ball as often as possible.\n\n\"He's probably one of the best rebounder wings in the league, if not the best rebounding wing in the league,\" Haliburton said on Tuesday. \"You got to match his intensity there when he's crashing. He was getting downhill, getting to the free throw yesterday.\n\n\"And then just in transition, when he gets the ball, I think everybody in the world knows he's going left to right, Euro step. Still, he gets to it. I think we all do a better job of just containing them, showing bodies. Which I thought we did really well last (series), especially with Dame (Lillard) and Khris (Middleton) and those guys, is showing bodies when we can in transition, so we've got to do a better job and we will tomorrow.\"\n\nIn Game 1, including free throw chances, Hart tallied 10 of his 24 points on transition opportunities.\n\nIncluding Nesmith's gaffe on the aforementioned fourth-quarter possession, Hart scored twice in transition following made baskets. He also assisted on a Donte DiVincenzo 3 immediately following Obi Toppin's spectacular between-the-legs dunk in the third quarter.\n\nHart put on an all-out attack on the rim in transition and the Pacers did not handle it well.\n\n\"We gotta do much better containing Hart in transition,\" Carlisle said on Tuesday. \"When he gets a defensive rebound, he's great at just taking it and knifing his way full-court to the basket. He's a guy we gotta treat like, you know, Giannis (Antetokounmpo) and (Damian) Lillard and guys like that, that are full court high-speed attackers. He really had a high impact on the game yesterday.\"\n\nKnicks guard Jalen Brunson is one of the NBA's toughest players to guard. His herky-jerky game, replete with elite touch and deadly outside shooting, is difficult for any team to contain, but the Pacers have to do a better job executing on defense in the moments that matter most.\n\n\"Our overall team defense has got to be better,\" Carlisle said. \"Certainly we have to be better in all areas. Everything. Pressure on the ball, our positioning, our ability to show our hands and stay out of fouls. We got to keep Brunson off the free throw line. He's gonna get their some. But getting there 14 times is too many. It's too many.\"\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Brunson shot eight of his 14 free throws. He shot three of them in the final 12.7 seconds, but there were also two drives in which the Pacers fouled Brunson as he was attempting shots. One of those fouls came against Nesmith with 3:29 remaining:\n\nBut the play Brunson made on the Knicks' previous offensive possessions shows why he is such a difficult player to defend.\n\nImmediately before Nesmith crowded Brunson and fouled him on the reach-in, Andrew Nembhard had given him too much space and let Brunson rise up for a 3-pointer:\n\nFirst, the Pacers gave Brunson too much space and then not enough. It is the cat-and-mouse game that Brunson can play with defenders that makes him so difficult to limit on any given night and he showed that off throughout the fourth quarter, including on DiVincenzo's big 3 with 40.4 seconds left.\n\nThat 3 was a defensive possession the Pacers did not execute well enough.\n\nThe Knicks wisely put DiVincenzo one pass away from Brunson, but the double-team that the Pacers sent at Brunson didn't bother him at all. Nembhard had already allowed Brunson inside the 3-point arc before he got physical with the Knicks point guard. Then, with Nesmith running toward Brunson from below the free-throw line, he could not take away the passing lane to the high quadrant on the left wing. Ultimately, the Pacers let Brunson get too far inside the 3-point line without enough resistance before sending a late double that did little to affect Brunson.\n\nThe Pacers need to continue to give Brunson challenging defensive looks, so throwing different defenders and strategies at him will be useful moving forward, but the Pacers also need to execute those strategies. Brunson makes it incredibly difficult, but the defensive execution can be better in Game 2.\n\nWhile some may have disagreed with the officials' willingness to call an illegal screen in the waning moments of a game, it was the correct call, confirmed both through the replay system and the Last Two Minute Report.\n\nUltimately, while reasonable people can debate whether or not they want the game called that tightly at the end of games, the foul and resulting turnover on that play do not happen if Haliburton and Turner are on the same page offensively. If they are more connected, Turner is clearly set on the screen and the Pacers do not have to worry about an offensive foul being called.\n\nAnd it's important to note that Turner's offensive foul with 18.4 seconds remaining was not the only mistake Haliburton and Turner made together in the pick-and-roll late in Game 1. Three minutes earlier, Haliburton threw an off-target pass to Turner and OG Anunoby took it the other way for a dunk to give the Knicks a two-point lead.\n\n\"I just gotta be better,\" Haliburton said on Tuesday. \"The moving screen was on me. The turnover, he didn't didn't quite roll where I thought he was gonna and OG got the steal. That was on me.\n\n\"So I think it's less about miscommunication with Myles and more on Tyrese. I gotta be better in Game 2.\"\n\nIn Game 1, Haliburton put up six points on 2-of-6 shooting, eight assists and four steals in 36 minutes. It was the fewest shots he had taken in a game since he put up nine points on 4-of-7 shooting in Game 1 against the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. That first game against the Bucks was the only time he took fewer than 10 shots in a game in the first round, so maybe the same will be true in Game 2 against the Knicks.\n\nNo matter what happens, the Pacers will need Haliburton to be better on Wednesday to tie the series before it heads to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Knicks' Jalen Brunson is shredding postseason defenses", "body": "This was Jalen Brunson's moment. Donte DiVincenzo would make sure of that.\n\nThe two New York Knicks sat in front of reporters following Brunson's Game 1 blowup against the Indiana Pacers, a 43-point performance that has become run of the mill for the All-Star point guard. These days, a Brunson scoring outburst is about as rare as a Tom Thibodeau broken blood vessel.\n\nBrunson has now gone for 40 points in four consecutive playoff games. The only other players in league history to accomplish the same feat are Jerry West, who had a six-game streak, Michael Jordan (four) and Bernard King (four).\n\nAs a reporter listed off Brunson's impressive company, DiVincenzo noted one standout and interrupted.\n\n\"Michael Jordan,\" he said excitedly, turning to Brunson as a wide smile overpowered his cheeks.\n\nBrunson looked at his buddy as if DiVincenzo were teasing him about a 0 of 20 dud.\n\n\"If you know my friends,\" Brunson said the next day, \"You should know that they're all a -- -- -. ... Usually, they're all sarcastic and so I just tried to stop him before he kept going.\"\n\nThe best of friends show kindness only behind each other's backs. And behind Brunson's is a shrine of accomplishments that is exciting DiVincenzo more by the second.\n\nBrunson is the first player in NBA history with 40 points and five assists in four consecutive playoff games. He's just the second guy ever, behind only West, with five straight playoff games of 39-plus.\n\nHe's averaging 36.6 points during the postseason, which leads the NBA, to go with 8.6 assists. The only player to have those numbers for a postseason run was Russell Westbrook, who did it in 2016-17 on far less efficient shooting and in only five games, four of which his team lost.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him, just knowing what type of person he is,\" DiVincenzo said of Brunson. \"He doesn't take praise and accolades and all that stuff. He doesn't take it well. He's always trying to get better. He always knows there's going to be more doubters, more things to improve on. That's his beauty as a person.\"\n\nThe Pacers, who trail the Knicks 1-0 in their second-round series, are witnessing the basketball beauty.\n\nBrunson's 43 points came on 14-of-26 shooting; he sank all 14 of his free throws. The Pacers were one of the worst fouling culprits during the regular season. It showed.\n\nThese are the types of shots the Knicks can expect from Brunson in this series. Indiana's defenders notoriously stick to potential shooters who line the perimeter. It prevents 3-point attempts, which the Pacers rarely give up. And it funnels drivers into center Myles Turner, one of the league's premier rim protectors. But it also leaves the middle open.\n\nNo one allowed more shots in the paint during the regular season than Indiana did. The trend continued into Game 1, including for Brunson. Fifteen of his shots were inside the paint, many of them in the floater range that Brunson can feast from while neutralizing Turner's shot-blocking.\n\nBrunson may have gotten hot during the previous series when the Knicks downed the Philadelphia 76ers in six games, but it wasn't because Philly gave him the middle.\n\nThe Sixers surrounded him with long defenders, many of whom collapsed onto him whenever he neared the hoop. Eventually, he figured it out, going for 39 points in Game 3, 47 in Game 4, 40 in Game 5 and 41 in the clinching Game 6.\n\nFew people have reached these numbers -- not that Brunson would boast about himself any more than his friends would to his face.\n\n\"I understand what's going on, so it's definitely obviously pretty cool, and it makes it better to know that it comes off a win most importantly, but honestly no matter what the situation was, whether it was positive or negative, I have to come back and be better,\" Brunson said. \"Last series, the first two games I was awful, and for me, I do have to be better, so I have to put that in the back of my mind. This is the same thing.\"\n\nThe Pacers trapped Brunson in moments, but he got rid of the ball quickly. They full-court pressured him, which the Knicks expected, especially since Indiana did the same against the Milwaukee Bucks in Round 1. The strategy is an attempt to tire out Brunson while also bogging down the Knicks offense. If it takes New York a few extra seconds to get into its first action, it won't be as likely to score.\n\nYet, Brunson picking apart the Pacers in Game 1 wasn't despite his team's success.\n\nThe Knicks shot 53.7 percent from the field and 11 of 23 from 3. They dropped 121 points on only 98 possessions, an elite figure.\n\n\"The thing that's impressive, it's always within the context of winning and his teammates and that's always the most important thing to him,\" Thibodeau said. \"And I love his mentality because his mentality is that he's not satisfied.\"\n\nAnd now, he's showing up on lists with Michael Jordan -- even if he won't acknowledge the accomplishment and even if he worries his friends will use it as pure jeer fuel.\n\n\"He knows what he's doing but he doesn't address it. He's just trying to get better every single day,\" DiVincenzo said. \"Not being him and looking on the outside, I love it. I sure as hell love it. I will celebrate every day of the week. That's who he is as a person, not just a basketball player.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_katz@theathletic.com", "name": "Fred Katz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bernard King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/08003936/GettyImages-2151924663-scaled-e1715143224348.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers have been outmatched on the glass in both games against the Knicks. Despite their frustration, Indiana needs to shift its focus to a must-win Game 3.\n\nIndiana Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle was ejected with 33.1 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter of Game 2 during their 130-121 loss to the New York Knicks. Carlisle's frustration boiled over near the end of the game, and he was assessed his second technical foul for excessively complaining to the referees.\n\nAfter the game, the Pacers coach did not hold back in expressing his frustration over the officiating throughout the first two games of the series. Carlisle opened his press conference by going on a two-minute spiel on what he believes had been an unfair whistle towards his team.\n\n\"There were 29 calls in Game 1 that we thought were clearly called the wrong way. I decided not to submit them because it felt like we'll get a more balanced whistle tonight. It didn't feel that way... I can promise you, we're going to submit these tonight... We deserve a fair shot... There's not a consistent balance, and that's disappointing.\" - Rick Carlisle\n\nIt might be fair to expect the league to hand down a fine to Carlisle for blasting the officials. Carlisle particularly specified one play midway through the third quarter where Josh Hart clearly shoved Tyrese Haliburton in the back while running on the break. However, there was no foul called, and the play just went on.\n\nLooking at the numbers, there wasn't much of a disparity in fouls in Game 2. The Pacers committed 17 fouls, while the Knicks were called for 14. Indiana attempted 17 freethrows and made just 10, while New York went 18-of-22 from the charity stripe.\n\nPacers Have Been Outplayed So Far Knicks-Pacers series has featured a lot of physicality\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers have been long-time rivals since the 1990s. With the way this series has played out so far, the 2024 iteration has lived up to the hype.\n\nThrough two games, there has been a ton of physicality between Indiana and New York. Players from both squads are getting chippy, and as seen by Carlisle's post-game comments, there has been some frustration boiling.\n\nCarlisle can submit a montage of questionable calls all he wants, but that won't change the outcome of the game. The Pacers cannot hang their hat on the officiating as the main reason why they find themselves down 2-0 in this series.\n\nIndiana has done a great job matching New York's energy throughout the majority of the series.

But, of course, the Pacers still get another chance to snatch home-court advantage with Game 2 at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday at the Garden (TNT).\n\nThe Pacers haven't lost consecutive games since March 1 and 3 and they were 23-12 after a loss in the regular season. They lost two games against the Bucks in the first round and won after each, grabbing Game 2 and closing the series out in Game 6 after a loss.\n\nThe Pacers have reason for confidence, as their performance in Game 1 against the Knicks was much stronger than in either of those losses to the Bucks. Here's the prediction for Game 2.\n\nDustin Dopirak, Pacers beat writer: The Pacers' ability to bounce back after a loss might be one of their most important traits. For a young team they're good at taking lessons and applying them quickly and after a day to watch film and practice, they'll be able to diagnose a lot of their issues from Game 1 and fix them. All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton in particular knows that his approach to Game 1 wasn't the right one and a more aggressive version of Haliburton should make a difference.\n\nOn the flip side of that, the Pacers didn't play that poorly in Game 1 and there are only so many opportunities for drastic fixes. They need to be better on the glass and keep making life as difficult as they can on Jalen Brunson, but their shortcomings in those areas had less to do with the idea that they didn't see those problems coming and more with the fact that the Knicks crash the offensive boards relentlessly and Brunson simply doesn't tire. Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell fought to stay with him as much as they could, but Brunson is excellent at creating space and he seems to get stronger as the game goes on even -- especially -- when he plays heavy minutes. He scored 21 points in the fourth quarter alone at the end of a night when he played 43 minutes.\n\nThe long and short of it that both teams know what they're in for, so there's a good chance every game is going to be tight. It says here the Pacers end up on the right side of it on Wednesday, but it won't take much for things to swing the other way: Pacers 120, Knicks 115", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The team announced that he was questionable to return with a sore right foot, but the players didn't know how serious it was.\n\n\"We were going in thinking that we weren't [going to get him back],\" Hartenstein said. \"So we came in, we were really talking about it. We knew we could beat 'em even if Jalen wasn't back, so we had confidence.\"\n\nThe Knicks were up by seven points when Brunson checked out, and the Pacers were up by 10 at at the half. Brunson heard the chant and noticed the standing ovation as he walked back onto the court at Madison Square Garden, but said he was focused on \"making sure that I can move.\" When New York forward Josh Hart saw Brunson getting shots up, \"I told him just to be smart,\" Hart said.\n\nTwenty-four minutes of basketball later, Hart had more words for Brunson: \"A'ight, Willis.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer not to comment on it,\" Brunson said, with a sheepish smile on his face, when asked about his teammate's Willis Reed reference following the Knicks' 130-121 win, which put them up 2-0 in the series.\n\nThe comparison is irresistible, given that Brunson's triumphant return occurred 54 years to the day after Reed hobbled onto the court and helped inspire the Knicks to beat the Lakers in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals. But it is imperfect. After acting as a decoy during New York's first few offensive possessions of the first half, Brunson made it clear that he was not out there just to give his team an emotional lift. He continually got into the paint. He initiated contact on drives. He made timely 3s. He earned more MVP chants.\n\n\"We needed him,\" Knicks big man Precious Achiuwa said. \"Obviously he came out with a lot of spark. Kind of like set us in place, calmed us down in the second half.\"\n\nBrunson played all 24 minutes of the second half, and in that time recorded 24 points on 9-for-16 shooting, plus four assists. In his 32 minutes overall, New York had an offensive rating of 149.2 and outscored Indiana by 26 points.\n\n\"We couldn't have done it without him,\" Hartenstein said.\n\nIn some ways, this was the same old Knicks story: Crazy stuff happens, Brunson leads them to a victory. This wasn't even the first time in these playoffs that Brunson had gone to the locker room, reemerged and played hero.\n\nIn other ways, though, this particular New York win was unlike all of the others. The team not only had to overcome Brunson's injury scare; it had to hold on after losing forward OG Anunoby with less than four minutes left in the third quarter with what the team called a sore right hamstring; he appeared to hurt himself on a missed layup. Before that, Anunoby had scored 28 points on 10-for-19 shooting.\n\nHart described the win as \"tough\" and \"gritty.\" In that Brunson once again showed his fortitude and that the team persevered after yet another injury -- on Tuesday, the Knicks announced that Mitchell Robinson would miss the rest of the playoffs because of an ankle injury -- it definitely was. But this was not definitely some kind of grind-it-out affair. Indiana scored 131.5 points per 100 possessions, and its star, Tyrese Haliburton, finished with 34 points on 11-for-19 shooting, following through on his promise to be more aggressive.\n\nIn New York's 16 minutes without Brunson, the Knicks scored 125.8 points per 100 possessions. Donte DiVincenzo finished with 28 points (including 6-for-12 shooting from deep) and four assists; Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists (in 48 minutes); Hartenstein had 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.\n\n\"When he's out, we just have to move the ball more,\" Hartenstein said. \"I feel like when he's out we especially go a little bit more to the elbow plays where I catch it, guys move off me.\"\n\nThe Knicks shared the ball when Brunson was out, and they kept doing it after he returned, taking advantage of Indiana blitzing him. \"This might be a product of being shorthanded all year,\" Thibodeau said. \"We know that this is our way. Our way is to play really hard all the time and to play together.\" Hart knows that they are far from the only team that prides itself on having a \"next-man-up\" mentality, but the difference is that, when they talk about it, \"we actually truly believe it,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been us, sadly, all f---ing year,\" Hartenstein said. \"Guys being out, guys stepping up. That's just our team.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_herbert@cbssports.com", "name": "James Herbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartenstein,_Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hartenstein, Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartenstein, Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The TNT announcers originally thought that Brunson had taken a shot to the groin, which was why he was gimpy.\n\nBut after Brunson left the game at the 3:32 mark of the first quarter and still didn't return several minutes into the second quarter, speculation abounded that he may have suffered a more concerning injury. Knicks beat writers also noted that Brunson appeared to be holding his hand after the collision.\n\nThe Knicks finally provided an update on Brunson late in the second quarter, revealing that it was none of the above. Instead, Brunson was deemed questionable to return because of a sore right foot.\n\nLater, Knicks beat writers were told that the collision with Nembhard was not actually where Brunson was injured.\n\nThe Knicks were up seven points when Brunson left the game but eventually fell behind 73-63 at halftime without him. Brunson entered the game having posted four straight playoff games of 40 points or more, so needless to say, it was will be a massive loss for the Knicks if Brunson has to miss time.

Without him on the floor, New York badly struggled, particularly on the offensive end.\n\nThe Madison Square Garden crowd, however, roared back to life when Brunson walked back on the court to start the third quarter.

They're up yelling and screaming into the game, so it's really cool to see those guys there.

Brunson carried them to the Eastern Conference semifinals in his first year with the team but lost to the giant-slaying Miami Heat.\n\nThe Knicks are back again in the same round and hold a 2-0 lead over the Indiana Pacers following Wednesday's win. If New York goes on to win the series, it will be the franchise's first conference finals appearance since 2000.\n\nFormer players of the Knicks appreciate what the point guard has done for the team. He has made the Big Apple City franchise a legitimate championship contender along with the roster Tom Thibodeau is guiding. They may not be the favorites but their grit, heart and Brunson's big-game abilities make them a tough out in a seven-game series.\n\nThe New York Knicks legends who showed up in Game 2 lustily egged on this current version of the team.

The Pacers challenged the moving screen call and lost, and Turner expressed dissatisfaction with the call in the locker room after the game.\n\n\"Just in my experience in this league, I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game. I think it's unfortunate that it happened,\" Turner said after the game. \"We reviewed it, and they still called it an illegal screen, but it's the playoffs. I felt like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it and for the most part, you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs.\n\n\"We have to take accountability as well. We knew at the end of the day that we can't get to that position. ... I think the Last Two Minutes, we're all looking forward to that coming out.\"\n\nAll-Star guard Jalen Brunson said his father, Knicks assistant coach Rick Brunson, has been the same encouraging influence in the playoffs as he's been all his life.\n\n\"He's had the same role, since I've met him [birth],\" Brunson joked while speaking about his father after Knicks practice on Tuesday. \"Since forever I guess really. He's always encouraging. He tells me to pick it up. He tells me when to stay confident in myself. It's been the same no matter what the situation is, and I just think it's the playoffs now, so nothing really changes. So he's had the same exact role, and it's helped me a lot.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristian_winfield@nydailynews.com", "name": "Kristian Winfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stress fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Late in the fourth quarter, Aaron Nesmith was called for a kicked ball violation while guarding the Knicks' Jalen Brunson. Replay showed that the ball did not hit the Pacers forward's foot and play should have continued.\n\nAfter the game, referee Zach Zarba admitted as much in the Pool Report, per Ian Begley of SNY:\n\n\"Question: Upon review, was the kicked ball call against Aaron Nesmith deemed to be correct?\n\nZarba: On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation. Post-game review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal.\n\nQuestion: Could the Pacers have been allowed to challenge the kick ball call?\n\nZarba: A kicked ball violation is not reviewable and not subject to the coach's challenge. The three things that teams can challenge are fouls, goaltends, and out of bounds.\"\n\nIt's good to know that Pacers' fans aren't crazy for booing the call, but also unfortunate that the call isn't reviewable. The playoffs are intense, and a lot of different things can happen to put a team in a poor spot.\n\nPacers fall to Knicks in Game 1\n\nThe Knicks pulled out the Game 1 after outscoring the Pacers by nine in the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite the unfortunate outcome, the Pacers have a lot to be happy with. They kept in stride with the Knicks, even leading for much of the second half, and against a noisy Garden crowd.\n\nIt would have helped Indiana set the tone for the series but losing Game 1 isn't the end of the world. Regardless, the Pacers have to feel like they missed a major opportunity.\n\nTyrese Haliburton, leader of the resurgent Pacers this season, only scored six points on 2-6 shooting in 36 minutes while dealing with back spasms before the game. He did have eight assists, but Haliburton needs to be significantly more aggressive if Indiana is going to be able to hang with the Knicks in this series.\n\nSome of Haliburton's passiveness can be attributed to the Knicks' defense. Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo were guarding him tightly for most of the game. New York's defenders worked hard to fight over screens and force the Pacers guard to go downhill. They eliminated his three-point pull-up threat, and Haliburton didn't seem comfortable with his in-between game, causing him to pass up on a few scoring opportunities.\n\nGame 2 between the Pacers and Knicks will take place on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sampson@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Peter Sampson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Special_Decks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Special Decks", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NBA-referees-admits-to-officiating-error-that-doomed-Indiana-vs.-Knicks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Josh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists, playing every single minute of the contest for the fourth time this postseason. He is averaging 46.8 minutes per game in the playoffs, which leads the league.\n\nIndiana was led by All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton - who bounced back from a poor Game 1 - racking up 34 points, nine assists and three steals in the losing effort, while former Knick Obi Toppin added 20 points off the bench.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers upset the Milwaukee Bucks in six games in the first round, though the No. 3 seed played the entire series without two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nThere was a contentious moment late in the fourth quarter when the game was whistled dead and Knicks big man Isaiah Hartenstein appeared to be penalized for a double dribble, though after discussion, the officials ruled that it was an inadvertent whistle and possession was returned to New York.\n\nIndiana head coach Rick Carlisle was infuriated by the decision and was eventually ejected from the game.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,\" he said after the game. \"There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing.\n\n\"Small-market teams deserve an equal shot. They deserve a fair shot no matter where they are playing.\"\n\nThe series heads to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

{"uri": "8117953415", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-08", "time": "19:22:25", "dateTime": "2024-05-08T19:22:25Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-08T19:21:52Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.outkick.com/betting/nba-playoffs-2024-indiana-pacers-at-new-york-knicks-game-2-picks-best-bets", "title": "Bet New York, Bet New York, Bet: The Knicks Aren't Losing Game 2 To the Pacers", "body": "The New York Knicks lost another man in their 121-117 Game 1 Eastern Conference semifinal win against the Indiana Pacers on Monday in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. Oft-injured Knicks big Mitchell Robinson will reportedly miss the next 6-8 weeks with a stress fracture in his ankle. Robinson's absence adds to the pile for New York's injury report, which includes All-Star PF Julius Randle and sharpshooting forward Bojan Bogdanovic.\n\nHowever, the injuries to Randle, Bogdanovic, and Robinson are causing the betting market to overcorrect. Sure, these absences hurt NYK's chances of beating Indy in this series. Also, it almost nixes all hope from the Knicks faithful of upsetting the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, should New York make it. Yet, Game 2 is at Madison Square Garden and the Knicks has the best player in the series.\n\nKnicks All-Star PG Jalen Brunson is averaging an NBA-best 36.6 points per game this postseason. Because of New York's injuries, Brunson has the highest usage rate in these playoffs. In Game 1, Brunson dominated the Pacers. He scored a game-high 43 points on 53.8% shooting and 14 for 14 from the foul line. Plus, Indiana doesn't have anyone long enough or athletic enough to stop Brunson's craftiness.\n\nFurthermore, Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau's coaching method has prepared his team for these grueling playoff slug-fests. Thibodeau's detractors knock him for asking too much from his starters in the regular season and his teams losing steam in the postseason. My counterpoint is the Knicks are tougher and have better stamina due to the regular-season workload.\n\nYou cannot just point to the current injuries and say, \"See Thibs is wearing his guys down\". Again, Robinson is always hurt. Randle dislocated his shoulder Jan. 27 attacking the hoop when Miami Heat forward Jaime Jacquez tried to take a charge. I.e. it's a freak play, not \"durability-related\". Bogdanovic suffered season-ending wrist and ankle injuries after colliding with Philadelphia 76ers SF Kelly Oubre Jr. for a loose ball in the first round of the NBA playoffs.\n\nBack to my \"overcorrection\" point, the market is all over the Pacers for Game 2. According to the Yahoo! Sports app and Pregame.com, roughly two-thirds of the bets are on Indiana's spread as of 1:45 p.m. ET Wednesday. Some of that is the ole \"zig-zag\" handicapping angle for NBA playoff games where you bet the opposite of what happened in the previous game.\n\nAnother aspect of the public betting on the Pacers here is that if it weren't for Brunson's brilliance and poor officiating, Indiana would be up 1-0 in this series. Indy held a 9-point lead in Game 1 and led by five points entering the fourth quarter. But, there's a saying in sports betting: \"Public 'dogs get slaughtered\". It's rare for the public to bet an underdog and casual sports bettors usually lose on this racket.\n\nThe Knicks out-performed the Pacers in three of the \"four factors\" in Game 1. New York only lost the turnover battle. That's not a sustainable way for Indiana to win because Brunson usually protects the ball well and the Pacers don't force many turnovers. The emergence of Knicks SF Josh Hart might give them the best two players in this series. Hart is averaging 17.9 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 5.0 assists in the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nBoth teams have matchups they can exploit offensively, but New York can get stops whereas Indy's can't. The Knicks were seventh in offensive rating and 10th defensively during the regular season. The Pacers were second in offensive efficiency and 24th in defensive rating. Finally, both teams might score a lot of points, but New York will cover the spread with its defense.\n\n_____________________________\n\nThis line is ridiculous, LOL. I mean come on. McConnell isn't out there for his offense. He's one of the better on-ball defenders in the NBA. Indiana's opponents beg McConnell to shoot because his jumper is broken. Granted, he scores 10.7 points per game (PPG) this postseason. That's up from 10.2 PPG in the regular season at 55.6% from the field and 40.9% from behind the arc.\n\nThat 3-point rate is misleading because McConnell only shot 0.6 threes per game. In the playoffs, he is 23.1% from deep. McConnell plays 18.6 minutes and averages 0.9 free throw attempts per game. He scored 20 points in Game 6 vs. the Milwaukee Bucks last round and 18 in Game 1 vs. the Knicks. Yet, he scored 7.0 PPG in Games 1-3 vs. the Bucks and scored less than 11 points in 41 of his 71 regular-season games.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_clark@outkick.com", "name": "Geoff Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151245709-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-27", "textStart": 1767, "textEnd": 1774}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The margins between victory and defeat were small, and the Pacers feel that they can get a win in Game 2.\n\n\"I thought we played hard. There are some lapses we had, some minor mistakes,\" forward Aaron Nesmith said Tuesday after his team practiced. \"But I honestly thought we did a pretty decent job for Game 1. We just fell short in some aspects of the game.\"\n\nCompared to Game 1 of the Pacers first-round series, they made significant progress. There were no jitters, and they had the right intensity level for 48 minutes. Indiana had few lengthy stretches where they couldn't get stops or score. That kept them in the game.\n\nBut they still fell in the end. Tidying up a few little things -- along with one massive thing -- will be the keys for Indiana in Game 2 and beyond.\n\nThe most vital ability from the little things group is rebounding. In the first half, the Pacers did well in this department. They had three more boards than the Knicks, and they all came on the offensive end of the court. They needed every extra possession as they took a six-point lead into halftime.\n\nIn the second half, New York dominated the glass. They had 19 rebounds while the Pacers had eight, and those extra chances added up fast. Despite having six more second-half turnovers, the Knicks took two more shots than the visitors in the final two quarters, and they won the game by four points. They are known for their rebounding and used it in a major way late in Game 1.\n\n\"That got away from us in the second half,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said. He finished the game with just two boards -- most of the blue and gold's rebounds came via their forwards. \"The rebounding really hurt us and gave them extra possessions,\" guard T.J. McConnell added.\n\nDuring the regular season, the Knicks ranked first in rebound percentage while the Pacers ranked 24th. It's no surprise that it became a storyline early in the series, and Indiana needs to be better in that area. Per possession, they know they can be more efficient than New York. But if they give the two seed extra opportunities to score, that doesn't matter much.\n\n\"As a collective, we need to be better rebounding the ball and [on] defense,\" McConnell said. Defense is the next place the Pacers will naturally go when looking at corrections from Game 1.\n\nThey started strong and held the Knicks to 49 first-half points, including just 22 in the second quarter. Their pressure was good, and the Pacers slowed down star guard Jalen Brunson after he scored a quick 10 points.\n\nBut in the second half, that all changed. New York scored 72 points across the final two periods. Brunson had 21 in the fourth quarter alone. Rebounding played a part in these numbers, but the Pacers effectiveness on defense dropped once the third quarter started. They need to find a way to bounce back and play 48 minutes of good basketball on the less glamorous end of the court.\n\n\"Fouls were a problem in the second half,\" head coach Rick Carlisle said of his team's second-half defense. He cited turnovers and rebounding as issues. Turner also pointed at rebounding as a problem on the defensive end in the second half.\n\nSlight tweaks to their effectiveness on the glass and on defense will go a long way for the Pacers. But their biggest area of growth is as big as it gets: their star guard needs to be better.\n\nTyrese Haliburton finished Game 1 with six points, eight assists, four steals, and three turnovers. He took just six shots, including only one in the second half. Similar to the opening battle of Indiana's first-round series, their star didn't have a strong impact to get the best-of-seven set going.\n\n\"I'll be better in Game 2... Just be more aggressive, be myself,\" Haliburton said the following day. He noted that he erred on the side of playmaking, and the NBA's tracking data said he tossed almost 80 passes. That alone isn't a problem, and Indiana scored well enough in this game. But they need Haliburton to look at the rim more.\n\nNesmith said that it's up to Haliburton's teammates to make his life easier. \"We go as he goes,\" he said. Everyone needs to help the two-time All-Star get rolling in Game 2.\n\nIf Haliburton is more effective and Indiana cleans up some mistakes on defense and on the glass, they will put themselves in a good position for Game 2. That is easier said than done, especially against a hard-playing Knicks team. But it could be the difference between winning and losing the series.\n\n\"This is a great experience for our guys. It comes at a cost, it's no fun,\" Carlisle said after Game 1. We're going to have to learn some things for Game 2.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

It largely consists of the Villanova alums Jalen Brunson, Donte DiVincenzo, and Josh Hart. However, there are key pieces that this squad will need to win over the Tyrese Haliburton-led team. One of them is an elite rim protector who can also set solid screens and rebound the ball fairly well. But, it looks like they will miss that archetype of a player due to Mitchell Robinson's injury.\n\nThe Knicks will be without Mitchell Robinson in Game 2 of this Knicks vs. Pacers NBA Playoffs clash, per Stefan Bondy of the New York Post. He has been ruled out due to left ankle injury management. The decision could have been made by Coach Tom Thibodeau and the rest of the Jalen Brunson-led Knicks because they saw how badly the big man struggled to keep up with the Pacers on both sides of the floor.\n\nMitchell Robinson got to play 12 minutes against the Pacers. He hobbled and could not defend on drop coverage against guys like Andrew Nembhard and Tyrese Haliburton. Moreover, Myles Turner also gave him a headache on the floor which prompted Coach Tom Thibodeau to pull him out of the game immediately.\n\nThe Knicks' big man could not produce much numbers in Game 1 of their clash in the second round of the NBA Playoffs. He only totaled two points and dropped a single assist on the offensive end. This was rounded out by his two rebounds which were fairly underwhelming.\n\nHe will now be replaced by Precious Achiuwa. Isaiah Hartenstein might also be called on to play more minutes after this tough injury management call.\n\nKnicks beat out the Pacers\n\nIt was a good start to this NBA Playoffs series. Jalen Brunson once again popped off. The Knicks' superstar guard knocked down 14 out of his 26 field goal attempts and went a perfect 14 for 14 on his free throws. These all totaled to a game-leading 43 points. His ability to pick apart the Pacers' defense was impeccable and not a single defender could stop him from getting to his spot.\n\nJosh Hart was the other big factor in this NBA Playoffs win. Despite playing a whopping 48 minutes, he notched an insane double-double. He finished the game with 24 points alongside 13 rebounds. Only two assists kept him short of a triple-double in this matchup too.\n\nThe last big factor in the Knicks' triumph over the Pacers was Donte DiVincenzo. This elite shooter notched 25 points while playing 44 minutes. He also got three rebounds and an assist.\n\nAll of these individuals will be ready to step up in hopes of getting the Knicks back to the Eastern Conference Finals. Will they be able to do it?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Why-Mitchell-Robinson-is-not-playing-in-Game-2-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Brunson has produced four straight 40-point games, the first since Michael Jordan in 1993. Knicks are shorthanded but still lead 1-0 against the Pacers, while the Mavericks trail Thunder 1-0.\n\nReal recognize real.\n\nThis is something superstars, regardless of sport, do quite often when they see each other go on a scorching stretch of games. This tends to be more frequent when the intensity of games gets raised to a high level, especially during the postseason.\n\nWith the New York Knicks making an inspiring run led by Jalen Brunson, who has eye-popping stat lines as the heart of the team's offense, giving him the credit he deserves is more than expected. This resulted in Dallas Mavericks star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 giving his praise towards Brunson.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 Has High Praise for Brunson Knicks guard stealing the show in New York\n\nBrunson scored 43 points on Monday in the Knicks' 121-117 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1. This marked his fourth-straight 40-point game, the first player to do that in the postseason since Michael Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals, and he is just the fourth player ever to do that.\n\nJerry West holds the all-time record for consecutive 40-point games with six back in 1965. Bernard King, a Hall of Famer who played for the Knicks, also did it four straight times in 1984.\n\nComing off his first All-Star season, Brunson leads all players in postseason scoring with 36.6 points per game. His remarkable stretch of performances prompted Don\u010di\u0107 to compliment him for stepping his game up to an elite level, per Mavericks reporter Mike Curtis.\n\n\"Amazing. He's doing everything for them. I saw the game yesterday. He had a quiet 40. I didn't even know he had 40 until I looked it up. He gets to his spots whenever he wants. That's my guy. I'm really happy for him.\"\n\nWorthy recognition of Brunson by the Mavericks star. On top of his incredible scoring this postseason, he is also getting 8.6 assists and 4.7 rebounds while playing a heavy workload of 43.7 minutes per game.\n\nHe does this while the Knicks are shorthanded, with Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic, and now Mitchell Robinson being out due to injury. With head coach Tom Thibodeau strictly playing a rotation of seven players, the trio of Brunson, Josh Hart, and OG Anunoby are playing over 40 minutes in every game so far.\n\nIt will take a lot for Brunson to keep up these types of performances. However, if the Knicks were to make a run to the NBA Finals, he may just have to continue leading the team the way he is doing right now.\n\nWhat's Next For Both Teams Knicks Lead 1-0 Against Pacers; Mavericks Trail 1-0 Against Thunder\n\nWith the 111-107 victory over Indiana in Game 1, the Knicks have a chance to go up 2-0 in their series.\n\nOn the other side, Dallas suffered a 117-95 blowout on the road against top seed Oklahoma City. They will look to tie up the series in Game 2.\n\nThe Knicks play Indiana on May 8 at 8 p.m. while the Mavericks take on the Thunder on May 9 at 9:30 p.m.\n\nRelated Timberwolves' Mike Conley Loves

Madison Square Garden was in true playoff form after Jalen Brunson knocked down a pull-up 3-pointer, right in Tyrese Haliburton's grill, to put the Knicks up 24-13 with 4:04 left in the first quarter.\n\nBut those positive vibes soon devolved into a state of profound concern. Oh, how quickly things went south for the No. 2 team in the Eastern Conference when Brunson -- who entered the night with four-straight 40-point games in these playoffs -- left the court with 3:32 left in the first quarter.\n\nThe Knicks' 130-121 defeat of Indiana in Game 2 was an emotional roller coaster for everyone involved. Brunson's unsettling injury was just the start.\n\nMany inside the building feared the All-Star guard would not return. Rick Brunson, Jalen's father and a Knicks assistant, was not on the bench and that clearly was not a great sign. And the Knicks were already paper-thin, playing without Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson Wednesday night.\n\nBrunson was hip-checked by Indiana's Andrew Nembhard early in the first quarter, and from that point on, he was seen grabbing at his groin area as he made his way up and down the court. Some assumed that collision is what led to his early exit. However, late in the second quarter, the Knicks announced that Brunson had a sore right foot and was questionable to return.\n\nFans were rightfully petrified. As Brunson goes, so does this Knicks team. This is a guy who has been in the same conversation as Michael Jordan in recent weeks.\n\nHowever, as the halftime festivities began to wind down, there was Brunson, slowly emerging from the tunnel with his chest out and head high. \"MVP\" chants began to reign down from the rafters as the guard began his warmup routine, knocking down one free throw after another, showing everyone inside Madison Square Garden that he was just fine.\n\nRegardless of how severe Brunson's injury actually was, it gave shades of Willis Reed, who was battling a torn right tensor muscle during the 1970 NBA Finals but emerged from the tunnel inside Madison Square Garden just minutes before Game 7. It injected his teammates with confidence and instilled doubt into Wilt Chamberlain and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nFifty-four years later, Brunson's return to the floor had a similar effect.\n\nBrunson's latest display of mental and physical toughness gave the Knicks a 2-0 series lead over the Pacers. Two more and the team will punch its first ticket to the Eastern Conference finals in 24 years.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_langs@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "Conor Langs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/web1_Knicks-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

A moving screen foul sparked debate; the Pacers felt the call was incorrect, but after review, it was upheld. Coach Rick Carlisle expressed displeasure with the officiating, but kept a positive outlook for Game 2.\n\nGame 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals between the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks ended with a couple of interesting foul calls. Both came at the expense of the Pacers, leading to frustration from the team.\n\nWith 52 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, and the game tied at 115 apiece, Jalen Brunson was inbounding the ball when Aaron Nesmith approached him, and the ball came loose from Brunson. It appeared that the ball went out of bounds via a kicking motion from Nesmith, so the referees called the play a kicked ball on the Pacers.\n\nThe play was not able to be challenged, so the Knicks regained possession. After the game, Myles Turner spoke out about the play, expressing frustration as he and the Pacers felt the referees were controlling the game rather than the players.\n\n\"In my experience in this league, I think it's the best when the players decide the outcome of the game...and the kicked ball by Aaron Neesmith was not a kickball. And you clearly see on the replay. So like I said, it's unfortunate, but it's just we can't put ourselves in that position.\" -Myles Turner\n\nMoving Screen Controversy Another controversial call occurred in Game 1, this time on Turner\n\nTurner believed the play was not a kicked ball, but according to the officials, it was. A few minutes later, another controversial call occurred when Turner himself was called for a moving screen foul against Donte DiVincenzo.\n\nThe call came with 12 seconds left in the game and the Knicks up by one. DiVincenzo fell down to the court, and Indiana challenged the call, believing that he had flopped.\n\nHowever, after review, it was determined that the foul was, indeed, correct, and the call was upheld. The Pacers turned the ball over to the Knicks, who would then add three more points with free throws by Jalen Brunson. After the game, Turner also spoke about that call, claiming that DiVincenzo flopped.\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate that it happened. We were viewing it, they still call it the legal screen, but it's the playoffs now. I feel like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it. And for the most part, you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. So we have to take accountability as well...So I think the last two minute report, we're all looking forward to that coming out. I think there was two controversial calls.\" -Myles Turner\n\nCoach Carlisle Speaks Out Pacers coach Rick Carlisle admitted he was not thrilled with the call\n\nNot only were the Pacers players infuriated by the call, but Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was as well. After the game, he echoed the sentiment of his players, expressing his frustration with the officiating but taking the high road.\n\n\"We're not expected to get calls in here. It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. So that's just the way it goes. I mean, we challenged it, they reviewed it, they got a bunch of people in New Jersey that agreed with them. So that's just the way it goes. So we just we gotta learn from that too. That's a timing play. Both guys are involved. So we'll have to execute that better next time.\" -Rick Carlisle\n\nThe all-time playoff series between the Knicks and Pacers is currently tied at three series wins apiece. But one of these teams will break that tie this year, and the Knicks appear to have the edge in that race right now. Game 2 will be in New York on Wednesday night.\n\nRelated Pacers' Rick Carlisle Bluntly Addresses Late Controversial Call vs. Knicks Myles Turner was called for a moving screen foul in Game 1 against the Knicks, and Rick Carlisle wasn't pleased.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/turner-mixcollage-26-apr-2024-09-27-pm-810.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

They entered Game 2 of their second-round series against the Indiana Pacers without Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic or Mitchell Robinson due to injury. Then, in the first quarter, they lost star point guard Jalen Brunson to a sore foot. He eventually returned for the second half, but as soon as one Knick makes it back, another, it seems, goes to the sideline.\n\nIn the third quarter, forward OG Anunoby injured his leg while attempting a layup in transition. The injury came mid-attempt, so it looked as if he just threw the ball blindly off of the backboard. He was eventually ruled out with a sore left hamstring.\n\nAnunoby, like Brunson, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo and Isaiah Hartenstein, has been playing virtually entire games for the depleted Knicks due this postseason. That was a dangerous approach given Anunoby's lengthy injury history, but in Game 2, it seems as though New York's entire team is starting to feel the weight of all of those extra minutes.\n\nWere it not for Anunoby, the Knicks would have fallen out of Game 2 before Brunson could return. He left the game with 28 points on 10-of-19 shooting. He is New York's best perimeter defender, and New York has a 25-5 record in games that he plays in this season. The Knicks are so thin right now that any long-term injury to a starter might be enough to end their season.

His comeback invigorated the depleted Knicks in the second half, fueling their rally and overcoming numerous injuries to defeat the Pacers, 130-121, securing a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference conference semifinals series.\n\nBrunson's involvement, coupled with the Pacers' efforts to trap him, quickly shifted the momentum of the game. In just over the first five minutes of the second half, New York produced a 15-point swing to capture a five-point lead.\n\nWhat happened to Jalen Brunson?\n\nBrunson appeared to limp following an apparent non-contact incident as he shadowed T.J. McConnell across the defensive lane, with roughly 3:45 left in the period.\n\nHe signaled to the Knicks' bench that he needed to come out as he limped down the court. He exited the game with four minutes remaining in the first quarter, and by halftime, the team announced that Brunson was questionable to return because of a sore right foot.\n\nHowever, nursing that sore right foot, Brunson returned to contribute 29 points and five assists. OG Anunoby, after scoring 28 points and grabbing four rebounds, was sidelined in the fourth quarter due to a hamstring injury. Despite the absence of Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic, the team's performance didn't falter.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo delivered 28 points, six rebounds and four assists, making 6-of-12 from 3-point range. Josh Hart also excelled with 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists.\n\nWith each game, Jalen's legacy continues to expand. Averaging 35.31 ppg in April, he has propelled the Knicks, who have been without Julius Randle since late January, to the No. 2 seed.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New York Knicks outlasted a valiant effort from the Indiana Pacers and beat them 121-117 in Game 1 of the two teams' Eastern Conference semifinal series. The game was on a knife's edge until the dying seconds of the fourth quarter, but the Pacers could've been out of the Knicks' sight by then had Tyrese Haliburton not had one of his worst outings of the season.\n\nThe All-Star guard finished with an underwhelming 'triple-single,' scoring six points, dishing eight assists, and grabbing only two rebounds. He shot 2-of-6 from the field, both three-pointers. Haliburton's stunningly poor display severely affected his scoring props for Game 2, as betting site FanDuel set it at 16.5.\n\nThe guard's Game 1 performance has dented betting sites' belief in his scoring ability, but Chandler Parsons still has faith in him. On the Run It Back podcast, the former Memphis Grizzlies star claimed he was betting the over on Haliburton's points total and urged the Pacers guard to prove him right, not for his, but for the Pacers' sake. He said,\n\n\"It's time that Tyrese Haliburton steps up. That fact that his over is 16.5 and we've seen this guy explode for multiple big games. He needs to do this for [the Pacers] to have a chance, he's gotta offset Jalen Brunson's production on the other side.\"\n\nAs Parsons mentioned, Haliburton has to play better for the Pacers to stand a chance because Game 1 showcased that Indiana will likely struggle to contain Jalen Brunson during this series.\n\nThe Knicks guard scored 43 points in the Knicks' narrow 121-117 win and became only the fourth player in NBA history to record four straight 40-point games in the playoffs. With Brunson in burning hot form at the moment, the Pacers cannot contend in this series if Haliburton doesn't step up and replicate his All-Star-level production from the regular season.\n\nTyrese Haliburton was exceptional during the regular season. He led the league in assists and averaged over 20 points per game, earning him a starting spot on the Eastern Conference's All-Star team. However, while he had the time of his life during the regular season, the playoffs have been a different story.\n\nIn his first seven appearances in the 2024 playoffs, Haliburton has averaged only 14.6 points, 9.1 assists, and 5.3 rebounds. The guard's underwhelming form fortunately did not hurt the Pacers in their first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks. But it's worth noting that Giannis Antetokounmpo missed the entire series and Damian Lillard sat out two games, severely dampening their strength.\n\nWhile Haliburton's poor form wasn't an issue against the Bucks, it did hurt the Pacers against the Knicks in Game 1. Following this, he told CBS Sports,\n\n\"I just felt like, even Game 1 of the last series, I wasn't myself. Just lack of aggression, my energy was -- everything was off yesterday... [But] The world ain't ending 'cause we lost one game... I'm not hitting the panic button or alarm or anything... As a competitor, what more could you ask for than playing in the playoffs, playing in Madison Square Garden? There's nothing like it. So I'm embracing all of it and enjoying every second of it.\"\n\nHaliburton lived up to his promise. By the end of the game, he had 34 points on 57.9% from the field, and 63.6% from beyond the arc. However, while his offensive showing was a significantly improved one, it wasn't enough, as the Pacers lost 121-130.\n\nNow down 0-2 in the series against a New York Knicks side that is only growing in confidence at the moment, can Tyrese will his team bring this series level?", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_mahesh_lokegaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Jay Mahesh Lokegaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/f8236ec9-untitled-design-2024-05-09t132858.456.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The way it happened was very reminiscent of Game 2 of the Sixers series (30-21 NYK), where the Knicks were excellent on defense, and got rebounds which put them in transition for threes. The Pacers starters were anemic in the 3rd (4/14- 28.6 percent) (0/4- 0 percent) (0/1- 0 percent). (Andrew) Nembhard had three of the four made shots. And this was coming off the 73-point first half. So what happened???\n\n\"In the first two games, the Knick interior defenders continue to meet the Pacers on several drives about six feet from the basket. There is legit contact -- but it's the playoffs -- and the Knicks are contesting many shots in the paint. Different Pacers are looking to get to the rim and the glass. They get cut off far away, or challenged on a layup that would be a very long layup. These aren't floaters - they're hard drives that are denied.\n\n\"You have to remember that the Pacers were first in paint points during the regular season. They shoot threes at a good clip, but they rely on the paint. With every interior miss, the Knicks were able to get out and push. (Donte) DiVincenzo is great again in the third - he scores 12 points and makes big baskets in the flow. The Knicks get two big blocks; running off a block is almost easier than running off a steal. So they get easy offense in the quarter.\n\nBROWN: \"They combined to shoot 10-for-29 (34.4 percent) and went 0-for-5 from beyond the arc and 0-for-3 from the free-throw line. These subpar combined numbers show the strength of the Knicks' interior defense throughout the game. You have to give some credit to (Precious) Achuiwa for playing the last 15 minutes and guarding Siakam a lot. So, if you are the Knicks, are you saying before the game that we will hold two of their top three scorers to zero threes or made free throws? That you will hold those two players to three free throw attempts? Major effort by the Knicks.\n\n\"Siakam relies on his one-on-one drives in isolations. (OG) Anunoby made him veer from the paint in some of those plays. The help defenders are cutting him off far away. All defenders are keeping him from a straight drive to the rim. Turner was coming off a big Milwaukee series. He plays a lot of pick & pop -- a Knick defensive weakness -- but he is only 2-of-8 from three in these games; he really isn't getting clean looks from three. Four attempts per game isn't a ton.\n\n\"(Tyrese) Haliburton had a good game - Nembhard hit seven of nine attempts; but the Knicks are containing the Pacers' entire front line. And that matters, because the Knicks are making runs against the Pacers' starters, not the Indiana bench. Can the Knicks contain Siakam and Turner in Indiana? We'll see..\n\nBROWN: \"So in Game 1, the Knicks ran about 25 set plays. They tried to set up Brunson in different ways, and it was all pretty good. From the start of Game 2, the Knicks surprisingly played Indiana's tempo; that wasn't great by the time we got to halftime. Knicks were down, 73-63.\n\n\"But when they had possessions in the 'flow' -- not in the fast-break or a halfcourt set -- they moved well without the ball. They ran a ton of high-post split games to free up DiVincenzo and Brunson, even Anunoby - all with (Isaiah) Hartenstein as the passer. He ends up with eight assists and just one turnover, and he made great passes that required precision.\n\n\"When the Knicks acquired Hartenstein, I watched eight of his Clippers games. I also called Jay Larranaga, an assistant with the Clippers (and a former Knicks G League coach). The concept here was that Hartenstein was a plus passer. He played on an excellent bench unit with the Clippers that featured good three-point shooters (such as Luke Kennard). So that was kind of his thing. Set a pick and roll screen, short roll and find the open guy. Some people thought he would be a 3-point shooter -- but he only had 30 3-point attempts that previous year. His passing was certainly a strength. Hartenstein had a little of that going with the bench unit at the end of last year; but the reality of it is that he hasn't been utilized this way enough in general. Last night shows that.\n\n\"And thankfully, this flow offense was very important as they Knicks shot 57 percent overall; all five starters shot 50 percent or better. That's extremely hard to do in any game, let alone in a playoff series.\"\n\nBROWN: \"So McBride was unreal in Game 1 of the Sixers series (21 pts), and played great defense in the fourth quarter of Game 4; both efforts contributed heavily to Knicks wins. But in what is called 'an effective playoff game,' he is now 2-for-8 in the playoffs. The effective playoff game combines individual stats into win shares in total. Ironically, (Immanuel) Quickley was 2 for 8 in last year's playoffs before getting injured. Deuce was a plus 37 in Game 1 against the Sixers; since then, he's been a minus 61. That leaves him at minus 24 overall.\n\n\"His shooting numbers are still decent (44 percent overall and 39 percent from three), but in this series he is struggling to defend (T.J.) McConnell. That was also the case in the regular season. When he played in the second half of Game 2, he was taken off of McConnell -- and matched with (Ben) Sheppard. With the Knicks so severely down on guys, McBride needs to produce on offense and - more importantly - by guarding people.\n\n\"Once again, the Indiana bench was spectacular. After going 21-for-34 (61.7 percent) in Game 1, they registered an 18-for-29 night in Game 2. The points they are putting up is one issue, but the ease with how they are doing it is a bigger issue. As a group, the Indiana bench had 15 assists against just two turnovers in Game 2; McConnell was running free with 12 of those assists. It makes you think that Rick Carlisle should just let the bench play; they have been solid plus-minus guys compared to the Indiana starters ...\n\nBROWN: \"The severity of Anunoby's hamstring injury could determine the rest of the series. After watching all the replays after the game, I kind of think that it's a little more severe than I'd originally thought. Before the game, I talked to an NBA guy about the Knicks' lack of depth and about the biggest problem here would be if one of the starters got hurt, because then what? Well, here we are.\n\n\"From watching the Milwaukee series, I thought there was a significant difference in how the Pacers played at home compared to their play on the road;they had one good game in Milwaukee. They run harder, they shoot better, they have great energy and they can get into those frenzies that create a 12-2 run at home. The younger players are more confident.\n\n\"So the Knicks can win in there, because we have seen the sporadic nature of Indiana's fourth quarter offense. (Last night, it was really the third quarter.) Considering Hart's comments about Indiana, I would expect a loud building to become a possessed building. And this sounds wild, but Caitlin Clark is the most powerful person in sports right now and she was part of their show for Game 3 against the Bucks. My dad (Hubie Brown) called the game and said she creates major electricity for their fans. If the Knicks are without OG, these games could be very difficult.

Indiana were six point underdogs in Game 1 and are 4.5 point underdogs entering Game 2. I'm choosing FanDuel as my NBA betting site for this wager (-110).\n\nThe most notable change entering Game 2 is the Knicks will be without Mitchell Robinson the rest of the postseason. The Knicks' depth had been depleted entering this series as it was, and that takes another hit. Miles McBride is now the Knicks' only reliable bench player.\n\nIf Isaiah Hartenstein gets in foul trouble or needs a breather, an unfavorable choice of inserting Precious Achiuwa in the lineup is the only choice Tom Thibodeaux will have. New York was outscored in bench points 46-3 in Game 1 and McBride didn't even score.\n\nAs big a loss as Robinson is from a depth perspective, his rebounding and size will be missed. After obliterating the 76ers on the glass all series, they still won the rebounding battle in Game 1. It'll be interesting to see how the battles on the boards go without Robinson.\n\nEven with Robinson's injury, it feels safe to say we know what the Knicks will give. Jalen Brunson will flirt with 40 points, Josh Hart will be a rebounding machine and hit clutch shots, and Donte DiVincenzo, OG Anunoby, and Hartenstein will all make great effort plays.\n\nAs for Indiana, their bench will be the biggest advantage they have all series. T.J. McConnell, Isaiah Jackson, Obi Toppin, and Ben Sheppard were outstanding in Game 1. They're a fresher team than the Knicks, and that discrepancy will increase in Indiana's favor each game.\n\nIt's a good thing they have the supporting cast they do, as Tyrese Haliburton's scoring struggles have continued. He scored the fewest points on the team (six) but still contributed eight assists and four steals. He's scored 20 points just once since April 12th.\n\nPascal Siakam and Myles Turner have both taken turns taking over games for the Pacers, whereas everything the Knicks run starts or ends with Brunson. Look for Siakam and Turner to try and draw fouls on Hartenstein quickly each game the rest of the series.\n\n\" READ MORE: Bet on the Oilers' money line in Game 1 of second-round matchup with Canucks\n\nI still think the Knicks can win the series, but this game feels like one Indiana should win. They came incredibly close in Game 1 but some controversial officiating and Brunson's greatness helped the Knicks escape with a victory.\n\nI'm predicting Haliburton picks up his scoring production sooner than later. I think a better scoring game from Haliburton and continued excellence from those around him will help the Pacers at the very least keep this game close.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_goodling@inquirer.com", "name": "Nick Goodling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miles McBride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Jalen Brunson had his fourth consecutive 40-point effort. The Knicks controlled the boards, with a 40-32 advantage on the glass. OG Anunoby played stellar defense. And Donte DiVincenzo made huge shots.\n\nIf you're a Pacers fan, well, you might have seen things differently. Two moments stand out: The kick-ball violation against the Pacers with 52 seconds remaining, which set up a back-breaking 3-pointer from DiVincenzo, and the moving screen on Myles Turner with 12 seconds remaining that effectively ended the game.\n\nAfter the game, the refs admitted they blew the kicked-ball violation. They did not concede the moving screen, though, which was technically a correct call, but not one that normally would be whistled in a one-point playoff game with time winding down.\n\nOh, and DiVincenzo went down as if he'd been shot in the leg. It was a bit over the top.\n\nBroadcaster and former coach Stan Van Gundy declared DiVincenzo's performance worthy of a Tony Award.\n\n\"You never see that call at this point in the game. I mean never. That is a great acting job. Lot of great actors in New York City, see them all the time on Broadway,\" Van Gundy said.\n\nTurner, for one, agreed. The Knicks were ahead at the time, so it's impossible to say that the play cost the Pacers the game, but Indiana never got a final look at a game-winner because of it.\n\nTurner said he was eager to see the dreaded last-two-minutes report from the NBA.\n\n\"We're all looking forward to that coming out,\" Turner said.\n\nHe went on to discuss the moving screen violation (via CBS Sports): \"In my experience in this league, I think it's the best when the players decide the outcome of the game. I think it's unfortunate it happened. We reviewed it and they still called it illegal screen, but it's the playoffs, man. I feel like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it.\"\n\nCredit Turner, too, for recognizing that the Pacers had some letdowns that could have helped them avoid such a tight finish. They allowed the Knicks to shoot 47.8% from the 3-point line in the game, and lost one of their main advantages -- fast-break points -- as the Pacers lost the transition battle, 20-18.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle laid off talking about the referees all together.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating,\" Carlisle said in his postgame press conference. \"We're not expecting to get calls in here. It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't.\"\n\nSimilarly, it would be nice for the Pacers to find an answer for Brunson, who again topped the 40-point mark with a 43-point effort on 16-for-26 shooting. He was 14-for-14 from the free-throw line and added six assists.\n\nThe Pacers can take some comfort in knowing that the Sixers had no answers, either. After starting 16-for-55 in the Knicks' first two playoff games, Brunson has now averaged 42.0 points on 50.0% shooting.\n\nIt would help, though, if Indiana star Tyrese Haliburton (who is dealing with a back injury) could get going. Haliburton had only six points on 2-for-6 shooting, his third-worst output of the season.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_deveney@heavy.com", "name": "Sean Deveney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stan Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Following a timeout once the Knicks went up, 24-13, the Pacers came out and ripped off 11 unanswered points in only 48 seconds to tie things back up.\n\nThe remainder of the period was hilariously back-and-forth. New York could not miss -- it shot 76.2 percent from the field and 50 percent from three in the opening frame -- while Indiana hammered them on the offensive glass, securing six offensive boards for seven second-chance points. With Tyrese Haliburton scoring 13 points and Anunoby scoring 12 in the quarter, the two teams were tied up at 36 each.\n\nThe Pacers were able to take control of things in the second, in large part due to the extended absence of Brunson, who left the game late in the first quarter and went to the locker room, where he was eventually ruled questionable to return with a sore right foot.

While Brunson was in the locker room, his father, Knicks assistant coach Rick Brunson, left the sideline for a few minutes, presumably to check on his son.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Shedding_and_Accumulating", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Shedding and Accumulating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0507%2Fr1329488_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

New York now sits at -5.5 tonight, with Indy likely bringing the heat.\n\nBUY NOW: Get tickets for 2024 NBA Playoffs on StubHub\n\nLet's get right to the best moneyline, spread, over/under, and player prop bets for Tuesday.\n\nDid you see Game 1 of this series!? Did oddsmakers!? The Knicks barely escaped with a four-point win, and our best bets column for Monday covered New York's alternate -2.5 spread by the hairs on our chin. Five-and-a-hook seems like far too many points to give an Indiana squad that's confident, up-tempo and more than likely pissed off.\n\nThe Pacers, appropriately, pushed the pace in Game 1 and forced New York into mistakes while taking care of the basketball. Indy capitalized on the Knicks' miscues with fast-break points and kept the pressure on Brunson throughout the entire game. If not for the crucial moving screen call on Myles Turner, Rick Carlisle's squad might have stolen home-court in this series.\n\nMORE: Breaking down the Myles Turner moving screen call in Game 1\n\nThe Pacers got next-to-nothing from Tyrese Haliburton, while New York got a fourth-straight 40-burger from Jalen Brunson. It stands to reason that Hali is a prime candidate for positive regression, while Brunson has to cool off from this heater at some point.\n\nCarlisle's no slouch -- he's the man who helped Haliburton and Brunson elevate from good to great -- and he should scheme a game plan that at the very least keeps Indiana closer than down five points at the final whistle.\n\nThe Pacers have averaged 61.3 first-half points per game since the start of the 2023-24 season, second to only the No. 1-seeded Celtics. With Indiana reeling from a Game 1 loss after coming so close to the upset, expect Tyrese Haliburton and company to push the pace early and often and get right back into the swing of things.\n\nIndiana scored 55 first-half points against the Knicks in Game 1 and 59 first-half points in the opening-round clincher over the Bucks last week. They scored 60 in the first half of Game 2 in that Bucks series, and 67 in the first halves of both Game 3 and 4. This feels like a modest first-half projection that's just begging for action.\n\nHALFTIME PREDICTION: Pacers 55, Knicks 52 -- Indiana wins the first half (+140) and covers the +2.5 first-half spread (-110), while going OVER its first-half team total of 52.5 (-105).\n\nOne of the main ingredients to New York cooking up Monday's Game 1 win was Josh Hart pushing the ball up the floor in transition. He also rarely shoots the ball from deep, so you can typically bank on him trying to create for others rather than take scoring matters into his own hands.\n\nHart has 15 assists over the Knicks' past two games, both victories. In fact, New York has won five consecutive games in which Hart logs seven or more dimes. He cashed on the rebounding OVER we recommended for Game 1 -- here's betting he will once again cash by recording seven or more assists in Game 2.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/nba-plain--3a12739c-85e8-43e3-87bc-08788e08f629.jpeg?itok=-7E-vHUK", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

But while the matchup may be old school, Jalen Brunson and the Knicks are bracing for an opponent who plays a new-age style.\n\nTyrese Haliburton runs the NBA's highest-scoring offense, with Indiana putting numbers on the scoreboard that make the ones in the past Knicks-Pacers contests look like a different sport, not just a different century.\n\n\"I guess whenever you have the original teams from back then, there's always going to be some type of history,\" Brunson said. \"But you have two good teams who play very, I don't want to say different, but like, they play their own style of basketball. And so it's going to be a grind of who's going to go out there, who's going to want it more who's going to try to go get it.\"\n\nBrunson led the No. 2-seeded Knicks past Philadelphia in the first round, sending the Knicks into the East semifinals in consecutive seasons for the first time since making nine straight trips between 1992 and 2000.\n\nHe scored 40 or more points in the final three games, just the seventh player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games in the playoffs. The league's No. 4 scorer in the regular season tops all players in the postseason with 35.5 per game.\n\nIndiana's big numbers come as a team. The Pacers led the league with 123.3 points per game, sixth highest in league history, and also were tops in field goal percentage and assists. They reached 140 points 11 times, an NBA record.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers haven't slowed down too much in the playoffs. They averaged 113 while knocking off No. 3 Milwaukee and reached at least 120 in all four victories during the six-game series.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met three straight times from 1993-95 -- exchanging Game 7 victories in the latter two -- then again from 1998-2000, with the last two of those in the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana won the most recent meeting, ousting the No. 2-seeded Knicks in the 2013 East semifinals.\n\nNeither team ever reached 120 points in any of the 41 games.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup, that's really the simple truth about it,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller for five or six years and I know in 2013 there was another matchup. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

Are you kidding? There was no sadder place in New York City than Madison Square Garden at just before 9:20 Wednesday night.\n\nDepressed? This was 19,812 people standing in line to get on Dr. Jennifer Melfi's couch. The place had been so electric, so hopeful. The Knicks were up big. Life was good.\n\nThen Jalen Brunson limped off the floor.\n\nHe stayed off the floor for the final 15 minutes and 32 seconds of the first half. The Knicks were up seven when he left. They were down 10 by halftime.\n\nKnicks fans are used to seeing their team play short. One of the endearing elements of this team is how they almost relish that challenge. This was different. This was Brunson.\n\nThis was the season walking off the floor at the Garden.\n\nAnd then, in an instant, the season walked back onto the floor.\n\nThe tunnel through which Willis Reed had trudged exactly 54 years earlier is long gone. But it didn't take long for the folks in the stands to notice that Brunson was plodding back.\n\nIt was a few shouts at first, then a roar, then a wave. It wasn't louder only because about 8,000 people were undoubtedly flooding the bars and beer lines, getting a head start on Thursday morning's hangover, drinking to forget.\n\nBut the word spread. The faithful abandoned their healing Heinekens and their 7&7s. And suddenly it was like someone had attached paddles to the Garden's chest, and someone else had shouted \"Clear!\" The heartbeat was back in sinus rhythm. The night was back. The season was back.\n\n\"I was gonna give it a go,\" Brunson would say.\n\n\"He's a warrior,\" Donte DiVincenzo said. \"There was no doubt in our minds he'd be back.\"\n\nLook, it may be possible that in a week or so we'll look back at this epic, 130-121 Knicks victory as some kind of last stand. Brunson is still hurt, his right foot a problem now. OG Anunoby, the only reason why there was a game left to save when Brunson stepped back on the floor, has a hamstring issue now. The Knicks are only halfway to the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThat's for later. That's for Friday.\n\nFor now, savor this one. Savor the way the Garden turned upside-down at the sight of Brunson, and how the player and the building fed off each other, Brunson dropping 24 of his 29 points in the second half. Savor how those Knicks who were left standing held the pinball-machine Pacers offense to 48 points across the final 24 minutes.\n\nThat's it. Earlier in the day it was revealed Brunson finished fifth in the MVP vote. Nikola Jokic is a worthy winner. But nobody -- not Jokic, not Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, not Luka Doncic, nobody -- is more valuable to his team than Brunson.\n\nThis isn't an abstract notion either. The Knicks were plus-26 with Brunson. They were minus-15 with him in the locker room.\n\nBrunson even makes math easy.\n\n\"A great leader,\" Tom Thibodeau said of his star. Of the rest of his team he added, \"I love the way we responded in the third and the way we finished in the fourth.\"\n\nBrunson's teammates looked like a different group once they saw No. 11. They knew. Hell, much later, it was Josh Hart, of course, who gave voice to what so many Knicks fans were saying as he passed Brunson in the dressing room.\n\n\"All right, Willis,\" Hart said. He's an elite needler. But he was only partly kidding.\n\nIt isn't just the customers who react viscerally to these moments, after all. So there was Anunoby (28 points, 10-for-19 from the floor) and Josh Hart (19/15/7), there was Donte DiVincenzo (28 points, six 3s) and Isaiah Hartenstein 14/12/8). There was Precious Achiuwa, eight huge points in 28 minutes.\n\nYou don't think they were affected seeing Brunson shake off the pain? And look, it may be sacrilegious to point this out but the night Reed hobbled his way into legend, May 8, 1970, he scored just four points and played 27 minutes. Clyde Frazier allowed the Captain's inspiration to carry the day by then carrying the Knicks the rest of the way.\n\nThis time, Brunson did both. Even he didn't know if he'd be able to give it a go.\n\nThere's still a lot of ball to be played, unlike '70. If those Knicks had had to win -- goodness -- 10 more games to win a title the way these Knicks do ... well, they didn't. It's going to be a struggle just to find two more to make the Pacers disappear.\n\nFor now, the Knicks are allowed to savor one of the great nights they've ever had at the Garden, and so are you.

He is currently listed as questionable to return.\n\nIt is unclear when exactly the injury occurred. At one point in the first quarter, it looked as though he had taken either knee-to-knee contact or had been hit in the groin. However, he stayed in the game for a few minutes, and it seemed as though his hand, which is heavily taped, was the part of his body that was in pain.\n\nWith roughly three-and-a-half minutes to go in the first quarter, Brunson, who was not moving well, looked as though he was asking out of the game as Josh Hart committed a transition take foul.\n\nBrunson is not only New York's best player, but he has been one of the best players in the entire postseason. He entered Wednesday's action as the postseason's leading scorer with 256 total points despite the fact that other players have played more games thus far. He ranks fourth in the postseason in assists with 60, and earlier Wednesday, he was announced as the fifth-place finisher for this season's MVP award.\n\nBrunson's presence would be critical to New York under any circumstances, but think about how injured this team already is. Julius Randle has been out for most of the season. Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson both suffered injuries that are expected to be season-ending during the postseason. The Knicks have relied heavily on just seven players lately, and Brunson has been their only consistent generator of shots in the half court.\n\nThe Knicks were ahead by seven when Brunson left the game. Indiana took complete control of the game from there, and led by double digits before halftime. If Brunson can't play at his typical superstar level, the Knicks are likely too depleted to win this game or this series.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Shedding_and_Accumulating", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Shedding and Accumulating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/fa5e003b-6bc0-4b7e-a92a-189aee7f08d0/thumbnail/1200x675/52fd2cd4d09d0f8a127b4ad0838864fa/brunson-getty-3.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Donte DiVincenzo was 5-for-9 on three-pointers and added 25 points while Josh Hart had 24 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook BET $5, GET $150!

New York got three points from its bench in Game 1 and it appears that coach Tom Thibodeau is going to continue to ride his starters for big minutes as long as they can stay healthy and out of foul trouble.\n\nThe Knicks got bad news Tuesday when it was revealed that Mitchell Robinson will be out for six to eight weeks with a leg injury, further depleting an already thin roster. Indiana plays at one of the fastest paces in the league and the Pacers have to believe their style of basketball can eventually wear the Knicks out.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook lists the hosts as 4.5-point favorites with an over/under of 222.5.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the odds and trends:\n\nIndiana Pacers at New York Knicks\n\nTime/TV: 7 p.m. CT (TNT)\n\nSpread (from DraftKings Sportsbook): Knicks -4.5\n\nTotal: 222.5\n\nMoneyline: Knicks -185, Pacers +154\n\nAnalysis: Game 1 dissolved into a shootout in the second half and that was exactly not how the Knicks wanted to play. Expect New York to be much more deliberate on offense, playing more of a half-court game in Game 2. They will also need to be better defensively to keep Indiana from running a transition-heavy offense.\n\nThe Pacers are going to continue to push the pace and keep their foot on the gas knowing that they have a deeper rotation to keep the starters fresh. Expect another close game, but a lower-scoring affair.\n\nPrediction: Knicks 104, Pacers 100 (Under 222.5)\n\nBest bet: Pacers-Knicks UNDER 222.5 points (-110 via DraftKings Sportsbook)", "source":

OG Anunoby was ruled out for the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury but did much of the heavy lifting in the early going with 28 points and four rebounds.\n\nThe team is already without Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107, but it doesn't seem to matter as Donte DiVincenzo (28 points, six rebounds and four assists behind 6-of-12 from three-point range) and Josh Hart (19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists) also dominated.\n\nBrunson and the Knicks drew rave reviews for their efforts:\n\nWhile there was some controversy at the end of Game 1 when the Knicks benefited from an incorrect kicked ball violation call in the final minute, much of the outcome came down to Brunson vastly outplaying Haliburton in a battle of the stars.\n\nThose two were once again under the spotlight in the early going of Wednesday's contest, as Haliburton stuffed the stat sheet while catching fire from three-point range to give the visitors a double-digit halftime lead.\n\nOn the other side, Brunson suffered the injury and spent much of the first half in the locker room. New York's initial lead quickly dissipated, and the focus turned to the bigger picture of Brunson's health.\n\nAfter all, he has carried them throughout the postseason and scored 40 or more points in each of the previous four games. The Knicks' hopes of a long playoff run rest firmly on his shoulders, which is why the crowd roared when Brunson returned for the second half.\n\nHe didn't just return, he brought that crowd to life by helping spearhead a 21-4 run to seize the lead. While Brunson being on the floor provided the emotional lift, it was DiVincenzo and Anunoby doing much of the scoring with Hart doing a little bit of everything.\n\nIt was just a matter of time before Brunson found his footing, though, and he pushed the lead to eight going into the fourth with a scoring spark of his own.\n\nHowever, the Knicks didn't have Anunoby for that fourth quarter, which put even more of the onus on Brunson and others. Naturally, they were up to the challenge with DiVincenzo hitting critical three-pointers and Brunson scoring in crunch time to give New York a 2-0 lead before the series shifts to Indiana for Friday's Game 3.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The star guard erupted for a 43-point performance to help put Indiana away in Game 1. He experienced a foot injury scare during the first half of Game 2 but returned and provided stout production. Brunson ended the night with 29 points, five assists, and two rebounds.\n\nBrunson led New York in scoring on Wednesday night, but he had plenty of help. OG Anunoby and Donte DiVincenzo each amassed 28 points apiece and had serviceable defensive performances. Another thorn in the Pacers' side was Josh Hart, who garnered a 19-point-15-rebound performance.\n\nNew York's combined effort held the Pacers to 51.6 percent from the field, which a not a bad number, but it came up short compared to Indiana's 57.0 percent mark. Nevertheless, one of the most notable culprits of Indiana's defeat was their free-throw shooting.\n\nThe Pacers shot a lowly 58.8 percent from the stripe, while the Knicks nailed 81.8 percent of attempts. In the end, Indiana lost by nine points. Had they made more free throws, they would have had a better chance of overcoming their deficit. Speaking of deficits, Myles Turner did not have his best night on Wednesday.\n\nMyles Turner has to keep producing for the Pacers to be successful\n\nTurner is one of Indiana's biggest X factors. He entered Game 2 fresh off an impressive 23-point performance in Game 1. However, he did not reach those same heights Wednesday night. Turner finished with one of the lowest-scoring performances of the Pacer starters with six points.\n\nIf Indiana wants to overcome New York's gritty offense, they will need Turner to keep his production high.\n\nTurner has shown the ability to score close to 20 points a game consistently. He averaged 17.1 points per contest during the 2023-24 regular season. His ability to stretch the floor is a valued asset that he must continue to take advantage of. The ninth-year center attempted two threes in Game 2 but missed the mark on both.\n\nSurely, Turner will find a way to heat up as the Pacers prepare for Game 3. The star center is not the only one who will have something to prove. Pascal Siakam had a solid showing but left more to be desired.\n\nThe Pacers need Pascal Siakam now more than ever\n\nIndiana traded for Pascal Siakam shortly before the February deadline. His arrival was supposed to help push the Pacers over the top, and for the most part, he has helped the team stay afloat. Yet, he is capable of producing more than he has in the first two games against the Knicks.\n\nIn Game 1, Siakam scored an earnest 19 points and followed the performance up with 14 on Wednesday night. Both of Siakam's scoring displays were below his season average of 21.7 points. The star forward has championship experience and could massively elevate Indiana's offense with an improved showing.\n\nPascal Siakam and Myles Turner are not the only ones looking to improve for Game 3. Aaron Nesmith only amassed six points on Wednesday night. It will take an all-around team effort to rally and combat the Knicks' attack. Nevertheless, the Pacers have what it takes to regain momentum.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The Knicks have been getting the ball to fall more lately as they've increased their point totals each of their last three games.\n\nThe Pacers are out to put a dent in the Knicks' postseason run, something the Pacers tried (and failed) to do on Monday. The Knicks secured a 121-117 W over the Pacers.\n\nThe Knicks' success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but Jalen Brunson led the charge by scoring 43 points along with six assists and six rebounds. That means Brunson has scored a third or more of the Knicks' points for five games straight. The team also got some help courtesy of Josh Hart, who dropped a double-double on 24 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nThe Knicks are winning the series right now, leading the Pacers 1-0.

The Knicks are currently two wins away from the Eastern Conference Finals, and Brunson is the biggest reason why, as his play has taken this team to a new level.\n\nContinuing to break records with his play so far this postseason, Brunson recently made history against the Indiana Pacers, joining Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan as the only other player in NBA history with at least 285 points and 65 assist through 8 playoff games.\n\nIt is this combination of scoring and playmaking that makes Brunson so unique, because while he is certainly making it a point of emphasis to search for his own offense, the star guard also does a good job getting his teammates involved.\n\nIf it ends up being the Boston Celtics vs. New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals, it should be one of the more exciting series this postseason. Two different teams, Boston and New York get it done in their own ways, and should give fans a good battle if it ends up playing out this way.\n\nMany have been surprised by how good the Knicks have been this postseason, and it has been primarily the play of Brunson that has them at this level.

While much of the first half was a slow feeling-out process, once the second half got going, it quickly became a back-and-forth track meet that came down to the wire and included highlight dunks, key defensive plays on both ends, big shots, and last but not least, several questionable calls.\n\nIn the end, much to the delight of Knicks fans, it was New York, and not Indiana, that came away with the ugly win. And regardless of how they won, as Josh Hart said after the game, \"a win's a win\", which is why the Knicks come into tonight's crucial game two with a slight but ever so important 1-0 lead in the series.\n\nBut for more reasons than one, game two should prove to be just as difficult, if not more difficult than game one was. For starters, it's hard to believe that Tyrese Haliburton plays that bad again. On Monday night, the All-Star point guard scored a measly six points on six shots and was, for the most part, a non-factor. Now, Haliburton has struggled since injuring his hamstring earlier this season and is averaging just 16.5PPG since then, but his game one performance was particularly atrocious, even for his post-injury standards. While some of his teammates cool down, it's reasonable to expect Haliburton to be much more aggressive and in turn, a bit more impactful tonight.\n\nAnother reason game two should prove to be challenging is the fact that Mitchell Robinson's recently announced ankle injury leaves the Knicks even more shorthanded than they already were. New York, who limped into the playoffs dealing with All-Star forward, Julius Randle's season-ending surgery, lost key bench player Bojan Bogdanovic during the Sixers series, and will now have to find a way to keep up with the Pacers' frantic pace with even fewer players. This will likely mean the re-insertion of Precious Achiuwa into the rotation full-time and it should also lead to Deuce McBride being relied on even more as well. Regardless, asking an injury-riddled team, that is already putting a lot on its starters' plates, to overcome another injury to a rotation player, is a tough challenge.\n\nReason three is how difficult it could be for the Knicks, and especially the Villanova trio, to sustain the kind of offensive workload they have been asked to carry. Jalen Brunson and Hart's activity on that end of the floor has been incredible for the entirety of the playoffs and Donte DiVincenzo has been extremely crucial over the last two games. All in all, it's been both fun and amusing to watch. But it's also somewhat worrying. Given the Knicks' aforementioned current lack of depth, if any of those three struggle, it could be too much to overcome.\n\nLast but not least, are the refs. The last time the Knicks were the beneficiary of some questionable officiating, was in game two of the first round. And between games two and three, there was a lot of complaining coming from the Sixers organization and its fans, which led to game three being called in Joel Embiid and the Sixers' favor. Granted the Pacers have done much less whining and protesting than the Sixers did, there's a chance that the referees look to try and even some things out, which could make game two a frustrating one for the Knicks and their fans to play in and watch respectively.\n\nBut there are also things to be optimistic about on the Knicks' end. Although Haliburton should play better, it can also be argued that some of his teammates will cool down. The Pacers, who to their credit, do have a lot of depth, got strong performances from Aaron Nesmith, who scored 12 points, T.J. McConnell, who scored 18 points, and Obi Toppin, who scored 12 points. All of those guys could certainly have repeat performances, but they're all capable of laying a dud as well. In the Pacers' two first-round losses, Nesmith averaged just seven points on 5-18 shooting, while McConnell scored more than 10 points in just one of six first-round games, and Toppin scored a combined 13 points between the first two games of the Bucks series. The Knicks will have to be better defensively as well but it's plausible that one or two of those guys has an off game.\n\nThere's also some optimism that the aforementioned Achiuwa could provide the same kind of contagious spark that he provided in game four of the Sixers series. While Robinson was crucial in the second half of Monday night's game, he did struggle to be effective in the first half. Achiuwa isn't a great offensive fit, but he is certainly a lot healthier than Robinson is right now, and his strength as a switchy defender could prove to be very useful in this particular matchup against a screen-heavy Pacers offense.\n\nRegardless of which player cools down, and which player steps up, it should be another closely contested game simply because it's a playoff game that includes the Knicks. All of their games, wins and losses, seem to be incredibly stressful and come down to the wire, and I don't expect any different today. Indiana, led by a motivated Haliburton, will come out and try to land the first punch and steal a game at home so putting them away won't be an easy task. That being said, the Knicks won't fold that easily and as they have all season long, will continue to fight.\n\nI expect Brunson, Hart, and DiVincenzo to continue being the dominant force that they have been. Brunson seems to be having an easier time getting off good looks than he did against the Sixers, while the fast pace seems to play into Hart's coast-to-coast skills, and DiVincenzo has played well against the Pacers for much of the season. And on the other side, I fully expect Haliburton and Pascal Siakam to be more effective, meaning the game will likely come down to the others. How can McBride and Achiuwa, negate, or at least come close to matching the effectiveness of the Pacers' role players?\n\nI believe the Knicks, just like they did in games one and two of the Sixers series, and just like they did on Monday night, to find a way to secure the victory at home. But it will be another nail-biter. The knicks win off of a big bounce-back game from McBride with Achiuwa making multiple high-energy plays to get the crowd going and the defense being better overall. 118-113, Knicks.", "source": {"uri": "postingandtoasting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Posting and Toasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kento_kato@postingandtoasting.com", "name": "Kento Kato", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

To be at your best when your best is needed, even when you may not be feeling your best. That's who (Jalen) is. He's a great leader.\"\n\nBrunson exited late in the first quarter in Game 2 due to his injury before returning to the floor to test his foot at halftime. That sight apparently lit a spark for the second-seeded Knicks, who overcame a 10-point halftime deficit to outlast the Pacers.\n\n\"We're just sticking together no matter what, no matter what the situation is, no matter what's thrown at us, no matter what's at a disadvantage for us, we're just going to stick together and that's the thing we always harp on,\" Brunson said.\n\nBrunson is averaging a robust 35.6 points per game this postseason for injury-riddled New York, which saw OG Anunoby sustain a hamstring injury on a transition play in the third quarter. Anunoby did not return to the contest and finished with a career playoff-high 28 points on Wednesday. His availability for Game 3 was not immediately known.\n\nNow the series shifts to Indianapolis, and Pacers coach Rick Carlisle told reporters that he'd like to see a correction in what he believes is unbalanced officiating.\n\n\"Small-market teams deserve an equal shot. They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing,\" said Carlisle, who received two technical fouls and was ejected on Wednesday.\n\nIndiana's T.J. McConnell praised the fire shown by Carlisle but noted he isn't interested in pointing the finger at the officials.\n\n\"We're not gonna sit here and blame officials. We gotta be better. It's just that simple,\" McConnell said. \"They smashed us on the boards again (in Game 2) and just brought more energy than we did. We gotta fix that.\"\n\nTo McConnell's point, the sixth-seeded Pacers were outrebounded 40-32 in the series opener and 44-34 on Wednesday.\n\nTyrese Haliburton rebounded from a dismal six-point showing in the series opener to score 34 on Wednesday. He made 11 of 19 shots -- including 7 of 11 from 3-point range -- to go along with nine assists and six rebounds.\n\n\"I just felt like we took advantage of what was given,\" Haliburton said. \"Obviously, watching the Game 1 film, it has obviously been sitting with us that we gotta be better of getting downhill and getting more paint attacks.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the Pacers, their frontcourt members were unable to consistently sink their shots -- namely Pascal Siakam (7 of 18), Myles Turner (3 of 11) and Aaron Nesmith (2 of 7). Those struggles didn't help matters against a Knicks team that shot a robust 57.0 percent from the floor and 46.7 percent from 3-point range.\n\n\"We just missed some looks,\" Haliburton said. \"It happens over the course of a series.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@bnd.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Reggie Miller is the poster boy of the vitriol when it comes to these two teams. He hit shot after shot and sent Patrick Ewing's squad in tears a lot of times in the NBA Playoffs. Now, this heated battle entered a new era and it features the clash of Tyrese Haliburton against Jalen Brunson. Despite all these new changes in the league, there was someone who remained constant.\n\nReggie Miller might no longer be an active NBA player but he is still around the game quite a lot. There is no one that supports this resurgence of the Pacers due to Tyrese Haliburton more than the analyst. Some concerns did arise when it was announced that he would be on the NBA Playoffs broadcast for Game 2 of Knicks vs. Pacers. It was especially a big issue since the Knicks had a homecourt advantage. This did not faze him at all, via NBA on TNT.\n\n\"People are like, 'Aren't you worried about going back to New York City and calling a game?' No! I've owned this city. I've owned this building! So why would I be worried about walking on out there?\" Reggie Miller declared.\n\nUCLA and the Pacers are the only teams that Reggie Miller played for. He balled out on a nightly basis for these teams. Throughout 1,389 games, he knocked down 47.1% of his field goals and 39.5% of his three-pointers to average 18.2 points. This notched him five NBA All-Star appearances and a spot in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe ended his career without a championship but the 1999-2000 season was the closest he got. There he sent the Knicks home during the Eastern Conference Finals. Unfortunately, they met Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. They pushed the Western Conference Champions to six games but just could not force a deciding Game 7.\n\nPacers vs. Knicks so far\n\nGame 2 is going as expected. It has all been high-octane offense from the Pacers while the Knicks led by Jalen Brunson are trying to keep up. Tyrese Haliburton is reverting back to his All-Star form once again. He has knocked down seven out of his 12 field goal attempts and has perfectly sank all three of his free throws for 22 points. Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard have also been a huge help in the scoring department. These two have combined for 22 points while Obi Toppin gives them a much-needed boost off the bench with 13 points.\n\nTJ McConnell has also been a huge help for Tyrese Haliburton. The Pacers' backup guard was given the duty to facilitate their offense and it is continually paying off. He has dropped nine assists while also scoring four points. Myles Turner is also contributing by crashing the boards well. He has seven rebounds at the moment.\n\nThere is still a lot of time left on the clock in this NBA Playoffs clash. The Knicks could very well run away with this game but the Pacers have all the firepower to outgun them before the dying seconds start.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Reggie-Miller-fires-savage-jab-at-New-York-ahead-of-Game-2-vs-Knicks-Owned-this-city.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

He went into the locker room for an extended period of time during the first half of Game 2 of the second-round series.\n\nHowever, he returned to start the second half.\n\nNew York is already without Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107, which has left them quite thin in these playoffs.\n\nThe entire bench managed a grand total of three points in Game 1 of the series against Indiana, and that was with Robinson.\n\nThe team can ill-afford any injuries moving forward, let alone one to the player who has been carrying it throughout the postseason. Brunson entered Wednesday's contest having scored 40 or more points in each of the last four games, including 43 in Game 1 of this series.\n\nHe also joined Michael Jordan and LeBron James earlier this postseason as the only players in NBA history to post at least 35 points and five assists in four straight playoff games of the same postseason.\n\nJordan and James is quite the company to keep, which underscores how incredible Brunson has been these playoffs.\n\nAnything short of an Eastern Conference Finals appearance would be considered a disappointment at this point for the Knicks, who are the No. 2 seed in the East and seized a 1-0 lead over Indiana.\n\nHowever, any significant injury to Brunson would drastically alter that reality. The Knicks likely wouldn't have the firepower to keep up with the Pacers over the course of a seven-game series if their star player and leader joined the long list of players who are already sidelined.\n\nThat's why it was such a relief for the team that Brunson returned to start the second half.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Shedding_and_Accumulating", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Shedding and Accumulating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715216532/wif1a3lleivb5pnoxkkh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

But replays showed -- and Nesmith insisted the same -- that he'd gotten his hand on a bounce pass from Jalen Brunson.\n\nIt could have been a steal, and with the game tied 115-115, the Pacers would've had the ball for the chance to take the lead. Instead, the kicked ball call awarded possession to the Knicks, who proceeded to get a key three-pointer from Donte DiVincenzo just 12 seconds later.\n\nNesmith was animated in his insistence he didn't kick the ball. The Pacers couldn't challenge the play; teams can only challenge fouls, goaltends and out of bounds plays, according to league rules.\n\nCrew Chief Zach Zarba acknowledged after the game that the officials blew the call.\n\n\"On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation. Post game review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal,\" Zarba said in the pool report.\n\nEven then, the Pacers fought back. They got within a point of the Knicks, trailing 118-117 with under 20 seconds to play. After forcing a turnover, they had a chance to win.\n\nBut center Myles Turner was whistled for an offensive foul with 12.7 seconds left; officials said he set an illegal screen that leveled DiVincenzo. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle challenged the call, which the referees upheld after a video review.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating,\" Carlisle told reporters in his postgame media availability. \"We're not expecting to get calls in here. It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't, so that's just the way it goes. We challenged it, they reviewed it. They got a bunch of people in New Jersey [the NBA replay center] that agreed with them.\"\n\n\"Just in my experience in this league I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said after the game. \"I think it's unfortunate that it happened. We reviewed it, they still called it an illegal screen. It's the playoffs, man. I think DiVincenzo did a good job selling it. For the most part, you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. So, we have to take accountability as well.\"\n\nAndrew Nembhard then complicated things by fouling Brunson before the ball was inbounded on the ensuing possession, giving the Knicks a free throw and the ball.

No thanks, says New York Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nThere's no denying that Brunson has reached Michael Jordan's hallowed realm, at least by certain statistical metrics: on Monday, for example, Brunson joined Jordan as one of only four players in NBA postseason history to score at least 40 points in four straight games as he guided the Knicks to a 121-117 victory over the Inidana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semifinal opener.\n\nEven in victory, Brunson has never been one to revel in individual accomplishments, his focus centered solely on the main area of the scoreboard. With an icon like Jordan involved, Brunson was taking no chances: when informed during their joint postgame statements that his teammate joined Jordan's company, shooting guard Donte DiVincenzo put up a giddy expression, but was quickly told to \"stop\" by Brunson.\n\nBrunson addressed the goofy controversy as the Knicks prepared for Game 2 set for Wednesday night (8 p.m. ET, TNT).\n\n\"If you know my friends, you should know that they're all a***oles, first of all,\" Brunson said with a smirk in video from SNY. \"The one thing Donte said last night was actually really cool, it actually sounded genuine. But usually, they're all sarcastic. But yeah, I just had to stop him before he kept going.\"\n\nLittle more needs to be said about the Knicks' continued benefits of establishing a Villanova triumvirate of Brunson, DiVincenzo, and Josh Hart, each of whom played major roles in Monday's narrow victory. DiVincenzo had 25 points, the last three coming on the triple that put the Knicks ahead for good in the final minute, while Hart had 24 points and 13 rebounds while playing all 48 minutes.\n\nIn what was perhaps an attempt to shed his explicit label, DiVincenzo was able to get in a few words about Brunson's ultimate impact, as he's more than familiar with what he adds to a championship puzzle: the two played major roles in each of Villanova's last two national championship runs in 2016 and 2018.

In just two seasons, Brunson (591) has already surpassed Anthony's playoff point total (589) from seven seasons with the Knicks, showcasing his scoring prowess and impact on the team's postseason success.\n\nBrunson's recent performance in the playoffs, particularly in the series against the Indiana Pacers, highlights his ability to rise to the occasion when it matters most. Leading the Knicks to a 2-0 lead in the series, Brunson's stellar performance included a 29-point outing, along with 2 rebounds and 5 assists.\n\nHis consistent contributions have been instrumental in the Knicks' playoff success, demonstrating his value as a key player on the team.\n\nIn his playoff career with the Knicks, Brunson has averaged an impressive 31.1 points, 6.7 assists, and 4.7 rebounds per game across 19 playoff appearances. What's even more impressive is his consistency and ability to deliver in crucial moments, evident from his four consecutive games with over 40 points and more than 5 assists, a feat unmatched in NBA history during the playoffs.\n\nComparatively, Carmelo Anthony, despite his individual brilliance, faced challenges with the Knicks, particularly in terms of team success in the playoffs. Anthony averaged 28.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game in 21 playoff appearances with the Knicks. However, the team struggled to make the playoffs consistently during Anthony's tenure, missing the postseason in five out of seven years.\n\nWhat sets Brunson apart is not just his statistical achievements but also his ability to elevate the Knicks' performance in the playoffs and lead them to victories. Despite playing fewer playoff games than Anthony, Brunson's impact and contributions have been substantial, showcasing his potential as a cornerstone player for the Knicks' future success.\n\nAs he continues to excel on the playoff stage, Jalen Brunson's legacy with the Knicks is poised to surpass even the most illustrious names in franchise history.\n\nJalen Brunson's Rise Has Been Unprecedented\n\nJalen Brunson's rise to stardom with the New York Knicks has been nothing short of extraordinary, marking a journey of perseverance, talent, and determination. After playing a supporting role with the Dallas Mavericks during their Western Conference Finals run, Brunson's transition to the Knicks showcased his ability to shine as a primary playmaker and leader.\n\nIn his first season with the Knicks, Brunson wasted no time in making his mark. Averaging an impressive 24.0 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 6.2 assists per game, he quickly established himself as a star in the league.\n\nHis playoff debut was equally impressive, leading the Knicks to their first playoff series win in over a decade with a victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Despite facing formidable opponents like the Miami Heat in the second round, Brunson showcased his resilience and talent with dazzling performances.\n\nThis season, Brunson elevated his game to new heights, propelling the Knicks to contender status in the Eastern Conference. Despite facing setbacks like injuries to key players, Brunson elevated his game to new heights, averaging an impressive 28.7 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 6.7 assists per game.\n\nHis stellar play was instrumental in guiding the Knicks to a 50-win season and securing the second seed in the Eastern Conference, setting the stage for a deep playoff run. His outstanding performance earned him his first-ever All-Star selection, further solidifying his status as one of the league's elite players.\n\nIn the 2024 playoffs, Brunson has been nothing short of sensational. Averaging an astounding 35.6 points, 8.1 assists, and 4.4 rebounds per game in eight playoff appearances, he has been the driving force behind the Knicks' postseason success. With each game, Brunson has demonstrated his ability to carry the team on his shoulders and lead them to victory.\n\nAs the Knicks continue their playoff journey, Brunson's impact and leadership will be crucial in their quest for a championship title. With his exceptional talent and unwavering determination, Brunson has proven himself to be a transformative figure for the Knicks, ushering in a new era of success and excitement for the franchise.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishwesha_kumar@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Vishwesha Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzE2NTE4ODI3MzY5NjQ4/441238114_2643001899202994_3581701263571745677_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Jalen Brunson's 43 points were instrumental, making him the fourth player in NBA history to score 40 or more points in four consecutive playoff games.

Role players Anunoby, Hartenstein, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo are gritty complements. And while we don't want to put too much weight on the In-Season Tournament, the Pacers did shrink with the NBA Cup on the line in Las Vegas.

The Pacers could have come up with the ball for a steal, but referee Sean Wright said Nesmith hit it with his foot, allowing the Knicks to retain possession.\n\nNew York took the lead for good 12 seconds later when DiVincenzo made a 3-pointer and won 121-117 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nAfter the game, crew chief Zach Zarba said the call was incorrect.\n\n\"On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation,\" Zarba said. \"Postgame review did show that it hit the defender\u00b4s hand, which would be legal.\"\n\nZarba added that the Pacers could not have challenged the call, saying those can only be used for fouls, goaltending calls and out-of-bounds calls.\n\nIndiana Pacers' Myles Turner reacts after missing a dunk during the second half of Game 1 in an NBA basketball second-round playoff series against the New York Knicks, Monday, May 6, 2024, in New York. The Knicks won 121-117. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\nThe Pacers felt a subsequent call went against them, when Myles Turner was called for a offensive foul on a pick that knocked DiVincenzo to the court with 12 seconds to play. Indiana did challenge that one, with the call being upheld on review.\n\n\"Just in my experience in this league I think it\u00b4s best when you let the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said. \"I think it\u00b4s unfortunate that it happened ... called it an illegal screen. It\u00b4s the playoffs. I think DiVincenzo did a good job selling it. For the most part you can\u00b4t leave the game to be decided by the refs. We have to take accountability as well. We know at the end of the day we can\u00b4t get to that position.\"\n\nThe Pacers won their other challenge, getting a foul on Tyrese Haliburton overturned with the game tied at 113-all with 1:51 remaining.\n\n\"I think the two controversial calls, we had to use our challenge on one call (on) Tyrese, then the kicked ball on Aaron Nesmith that was not a kickball. You can clearly see that on the replays,\" Turner added. \"So, it\u00b4s unfortunate but we can\u00b4t put ourselves in that position.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/07/05/wire-84543553-1715055383-983_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Just two games away from making the Conference Finals, Jalen Brunson & Co. can take the Knicks to heights they have not reached since 2000, EC Finals. Even Knicks super fan Stephen A. Smith has his home team making the Conference Finals, according to his estimations. So far the ESPN analyst's predictions have all been on point.\n\nBefore the post-season kicked off, Smith took to his show, 'The Stephen A. Smith Show', to proudly back his Knicks, even giving them the upper hand in their then-upcoming contest against 7th seed hopefuls, the Miami Heat and the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThings have turned out exactly like the 56-year-old predicted a month ago. After the Knicks defeated the Pacers in back-to-back games, the veteran journalist had to let the world know that his Knicks were making the Conference Finals. Taking to ESPN's morning talk show, 'First Take', Smith exclaimed,\n\n\"You know they are going to be people who are going to try to steal my joy. They are going to look at me and say, \" Yo! It's just two games, but we are two games away from the conference finals. Just two games...two down, two to go.\"\n\nThe #2-seed will now head to Indianapolis to play against Haliburton and the bunch at Gainbridge Field House. The roaring crowds at MSG will no longer play in favor of the Knicks, and with added home-court advantage, the Pacers will surely look to make a comeback in the series. However, the confident MSG crowd is ready to host the ES finals series.\n\nBefore the arrival of Brunson, the Knicks were no match for the stacked Celtics roster, but this time the situation is different. The combo guard is on his way to sweep the Pacers, and New York City is screaming for more.\n\nAfter the Knicks took Game 2 in Madison Square Garden, fans were spotted shouting \"We Want Boston!\" outside the arena. The fans want the championship favorites, Boston Celtics, in the Conference Finals and Brunson is just two wins away from giving the city what they want.\n\nIf the Knicks manage to make the Conference finals, the list of celebrities flocking up to the courtside will be absurd.

There were a lot of moving screens, unnecessary roughness, and some questionable calls made or not called in this matchup. Jalen Brunson and his squad narrowly escaped the Tyrese Haliburton-led team but it did not come without controversy. Even the league's last two-minute report (NBA L2M report) posits that there were a lot of momentum-swinging mistakes made by the referees.\n\nIssues during Knicks vs. Pacers\n\nThe first mistake made by the referees during crunch time was with Myles Turner. A defensive three-second violation would have been called on the Pacers' big man. There were no members of the Knicks near him in the paint but he stayed longer in that area without having a whistle blown. This was deemed an incorrect non-call in the last two-minute report.\n\nThe second error in this Pacers against Knicks NBA Playoffs clash involved Donte DiVincenzo. An offensive foul that would have caused the Knicks the possession and momentum was not called. Here, the Knicks' shooter set a screen against Aaron Nesmith. While the pick was legal, he prevented the Pacers guard from disengaging by holding on to his arm and disallowed him from navigating through it. This was classified as an incorrect non-call.\n\nAnother crucial miscall involved Aaron Nesmith and it's the third for this NBA Playoffs clash's crunch time. The Pacers guard made contact with the ball during the last 52 seconds of the game. It was initially assessed that he committed a kicked-ball violation. Now, the decision was that it was an incorrect call because it touched his hands and not his foot. No replay was called to re-evaluate this play.\n\nThe last foul that needed re-assessment was the collision between Donte DiVincenzo and Myles Turner. A screen was drawn up by Rick Carlisle but the Pacers big man got there late. He then extended his body to still attempt to block the path of the Knicks player and it worked. Unfortunately, this should have been called an offensive foul. The league has taken their initial decision back and ruled it an incorrect non-call.\n\nMore officiating lapses in the NBA Playoffs\n\nThese four issues in the NBA L2M report that could have swung this Knicks and Pacers series were not the only things that bothered fans. There have been odd calls throughout the NBA Playoffs that left avid spectators scratching their heads. It has gone worse because even officials are admitting that they should have overturned certain calls after the game.\n\nA big example of this was Zach Zarba after Game 1 of the clash between Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson. He admitted that the call on Nesmith should not have been that way but it was out of their hands because they couldn't review it any longer.\n\n\"On the floor, we felt that would be a kicked ball violation. The post-game review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal. A kicked-ball violation is not reviewable and not subject to the coach's challenge. The three things that teams can challenge are fouls, goaltends, and out-of-bounds,\" he said.\n\nWill there be any means for the league to fix these issues? Or, will it remain a constant cycle of admitting mistakes in the NBA L2M report without any changes?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pacers-Knicks-L2M-Report-shows-4-mistakes-in-Game-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

I hate when a basketball game ends with a dozen whistles in the final minute.\n\nThe NBA's Last Two Minute report from Game 1 of the series between the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers is going to be a doozy.\n\nThe Knicks won the game, 121-117, behind another explosive scoring night from Jalen Brunson, who had 43 points to become the first player since Michael Jordan to score at least 40 points in four straight playoff games. But the Knicks also benefited significantly from several questionable officiating decisions down the stretch in a tight game.\n\nThe most crucial and most controversial was the offensive foul call on Pacers center Myles Turner with 12.1 seconds left. The play came immediately after a Knicks turnover gave Indiana new life, with New York leading 118-117 and the Pacers able to hold the ball for the last shot. Tyrese Haliburton brought the ball across halfcourt, guarded by Donte DiVincenzo. Turner came up to set a screen on DiVincenzo and DiVincenzo crumpled to the floor as if he'd been stuck by a cattle prod. Turner was whistled for a moving screen, giving the ball back to the Knicks and effectively ending any hopes of a Pacers comeback. (The Pacers challenged the call but it was upheld on review.)\n\nWere Turner's feet still moving when he set the screen? Sure. Slightly. By the letter of the law, it's a foul. But it's a marginal call at best, and not the type of foul that usually gets called at that stage in a playoff game.\n\n\"I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said after the game. \"I think it's unfortunate that it happened. We reviewed it; they still called it an illegal screen. But it's the playoffs, man. I feel like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it. For the most part you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. So we have to take accountability as well. Of course it's right after the game, I'm a little fresh in my emotions about it, but we know, at the end of the day, we can't get to that position.\n\n\"The Last Two Minute report, we're all looking forward to that coming out. I think there was two controversial calls. We had to use our challenge on one call on Tyrese [Haliburton]. And then the kickball by Aaron Nesmith that was not a kickball -- you can clearly see it on the replay.\"\n\nWhile the moving screen call is debatable, there's no doubt that Turner is right about the missed call on Nesmith. With 52 seconds left to play and the score tied at 115, Brunson tried to sneak a pass to DiVincenzo in transition. Nesmith deflected the pass, but the officials ruled that he did so with his foot, which is illegal, and the Knicks retained possession. In fact, video shows that Nesmith clearly deflected the pass with his hand, but the call was not reviewable.\n\nThe blown call denied the Pacers a fastbreak opportunity in the final minute of a tied game. Instead, immediately after the Knicks got the ball back, DiVincenzo hit a dagger three. Crew chief Zach Zarba told a pool reporter after the game that the call was incorrect.\n\nThe bad calls weren't the only reason the Pacers lost. One other reason was that Haliburton made several questionable decisions in the final minutes (he had three turnovers in the last four minutes of the game). But when playing against a quality opponent in a raucous road environment, it's next to impossible to win when you also have to overcome uneven officiating.\n\nThe other game on Monday night was equally interesting, but not equally competitive. In Game 2 of their series, the Minnesota Timberwolves eviscerated the Denver Nuggets, 106-80, to take a 2-0 lead in the series.\n\nThe result was notable for a few reasons. First of all, Minnesota was playing without center Rudy Gobert, who was away from the team awaiting the birth of his first child. Even without Gobert, the favorite to win his fourth Defensive Player of the Year award, the Timberwolves' defense still held Denver to its fewest points since Game 7 of the 2020 first round against the Jazz (an 80-78 win for the Nuggets).\n\nThe loss also marked just the second time during the Nikola Joki\u0107 era that the Nuggets lost back-to-back home playoff games. The only other time was when the Phoenix Suns finished off a four-game sweep in Denver in the 2021 second round. The Nuggets were nearly unbeatable at home during their championship run last season, losing just one game in Denver (Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat). But the T-Wolves are just that good. Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns were excellent again in Game 2, combining for 54 points on just 32 shots. It'll be an uphill battle for the Nuggets to come back and win the series after squandering home-court advantage so dramatically.\n\n... things I saw last night:", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_gartland@si.com", "name": "Dan Gartland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2585,h_1454,x_0,y_0/v1715094595/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si-temp/01hx9sn69wd3bw8xz1a9.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The comments came shortly after Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle criticized refs following a few questionable calls in Game 2. Carlisle was ejected late in the Pacers' loss over a non-call in favor of the Knicks.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers fell to the New York Knicks once again on Wednesday night, losing 130-121 to drop into a 2-0 deficit in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nAfter taking a 10-point lead into halftime, the Pacers fell apart in the third quarter, getting outscored by the Knicks 36-18, and were unable to make a comeback in the final period.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the game, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton refused to blame the officiating for the outcome of the game. While several key calls went against Indiana, Haliburton argued that his team was positioned to win, but was simply unable to finish.\n\n\"At the end of the day we got outplayed,\" Haliburton said. \"We were right there to win the game. Would I like more consistency [out of the officiating]? Yeah. But let's not pretend that's the reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough.\"\n\nDespite the loss, Haliburton sounded like he was ready to get back to work.\n\n\"It's 2-0. We're going back to Indy. I like us in any matchup. I'm not worried.\"\n\nHaliburton Didn't Want to Blame the Referees, but His Coach Was a Different Story Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle made his stance on the officiating of Wednesday night's game extremely clear.\n\nOne call in particular highlighted the Pacers' frustrations, and ultimately resulted in the ejection of head coach Rick Carlisle. With just over a minute left to play and Indiana attempting to come back from trailing 124-118, it appeared that the Pacers had stolen a possession after Knicks big man Isaiah Hartenstein was called for a double-dribble.\n\nWhile it didn't look like Hartenstein committed the infraction, even those who strictly abide by the rule book would need to be stingy to call him for a carry on the play. The whistle was blown, and the call was signaled. But after the referees conferred for a moment, the play was ruled an inadvertent whistle, and the Knicks retained possession.\n\nThe TNT crew calling the game was befuddled by the decision. The whistle might have been incorrect, but it certainly wasn't inadvertent. Carlisle argued much of the same right in the face of the referee.\n\nCarlisle was ejected seconds later after further arguing his point. After the game, he made the case that his team wasn't getting calls against the big-market Knicks.\n\nIt wasn't the first time in the series that Carlisle had raised issues with the officiating.\n\nGame 3 is set to tip off on Friday night in Indiana.\n\nRelated Pacers' Rick Carlisle Unloads on Refs After Game 2: 'We Deserve a Fair Shot' Rick Carlisle did not hold back in expressing his frustration over the officiating so far in their second-round series against the Knicks.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-07-may-2024-01-40-pm-1802.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Officials admitted after the game that they got one of them wrong.\n\nWith the game tied at 115-115 in the final minute, Knicks guard Jalen Brunson dribbled the ball over halfcourt. He then delivered an errant pass that bounced off the hand of Pacers guard Aaron Nesmith and into the hands of Indiana teammate Andrew Nembhard for an apparent turnover.\n\nBut officials whistled a kick ball on Nesmith, and the Knicks retained possession. Nesmith, who didn't kick the ball, protested the call.\n\nTwelve seconds later, Donte DiVincenzo hit a 3-pointer to give the Knicks a 118-115 lead.\n\nLate moving screen hurts Pacers\n\nThen, with the clock ticking under 20 seconds, the Pacers had possession and a chance to take the lead while trailing, 118-117. Tyrese Haliburton dribbled over halfcourt, and Myles Tuner set a screen on his defender DiVincenzo.\n\nDiVincenzo fell to the floor, and officials whistled Turner for a moving screen. This drew the immediate ire of TNT analyst Stan Van Gundy.\n\n\"That is shocking,\" Van Gundy said. \"You never see that call at this point in the game. I mean, never.\n\n\"That is a great acting job. Lot of great actors here in New York City. You seen them on Broadway all the time. That's as good of an acting job as you'll see. He technically was moving a little bit. Indiana's gonna challenge. I do not think that they'll win the challenge.\"\n\nVan Gundy was right. The Pacers didn't win the challenge, and the Knicks took over possession.\n\nJoel Embiid weighs in\n\nAt this point, Joel Embiid had seen enough. His Philadelphia 76ers were just eliminated by the Knicks in the first round and were likewise on the wrong end of some late controversial calls in Madison Square Garden. He chimed in with his sentiments on social media.\n\nOfficials admit they got kick-ball call wrong\n\nWhile there's plenty of gray area around the moving screen, there was no justification for the phantom kicked ball that set up New York's go-ahead 3.

What adds to those feelings could be the erroneous calls made by the officials too. Coach Rick Carlisle strongly feels this way during his Indiana Pacers' series against the Jalen Brunson-led New York Knicks. The head honcho had his temper flare up all the way to the top of his head and he could not contain his emotions at all, via NBA TV.\n\nRick Carlisle blasts the officiating\n\n\"I'm always to talking to our guys about not making it about the officials. But, we deserve a fair shot. There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing. Give New York credit for the physicality that they are playing with. But, their physicality is rewarded and ours is penalized time after time. I'm just really disappointed,\" the Pacers head honcho said.\n\nThis is not the first time members of the Pacers faithful outlined their dismay at the way the NBA Playoffs are being officiated. The last two-minute report in Game 1 had four crucial errors which could have swung the momentum of the series towards the Pacers if they were called correctly. Now, the same story might unfold in Game 2 against Jalen Brunson's Knicks given how tight the clash between both teams was during crunch time.\n\nOverall, the Pacers were given 17 fouls throughout the course of this NBA Playoffs game. The disparity is not that large to the Knicks' 14 but the timing of when they were called clearly cut off some momentum from the Tyrese Haliburton-led squad.\n\nThe difference in calls was mostly the same when compared to Game 1. The Pacers got 22 fouls assessed on them. Some were deemed incorrect non-calls and others were labeled as incorrect calls at the end of the clash. On the other hand, the Knicks only got 19 fouls called against them.\n\nPacers blow a significant lead\n\nPace and space is the name of the game in the modern NBA. No matter how insurmountable the lead is heading into halftime any team is capable of shooting and running themselves back into a game. This is exactly what the Pacers had to learn, albeit in the hard way. They were up 10 points before the third quarter started and everything crumbled. The Knicks led by Jalen Brunson managed to find a lot of holes in their defense. They scored 36 points in just 12 minutes off of these lapses. Meanwhile, the Pacers could not get anything going and were stuck at 18 points.\n\nThis amount of offensive production was clearly not enough to win the NBA Playoffs clash. Furthermore, Coach Rick Carlisle's squad really needs another 20-point per-game scorer. While Obi Toppin and Tyrese Haliburton combined for 54 points, no one else managed to score 20 points for their squad. There were six Pacers who got double-digit scoring numbers but that clearly was not going to cut it.\n\nThe Pacers are going to play the Knicks on their home floor next. Hopefully, the time before the clash and the crowd make it so that they get a win in this NBA Playoffs series. If they get one, the momentum might start to shift in their favor.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rick-Carlisle-goes-scorched-earth-on-officiating-after-Game-2-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

CBS Sports will provide daily picks for the duration of the postseason. Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals.\n\nNew York Knicks vs. Indiana Pacers\n\nThere's been quite a bit of consternation about the officiating in Game 1. I'm not prepared to say there will be so many controversial endgame fouls throughout the series... but remember, the Pacers led the NBA in fouls committed while the Knicks ranked 25th. Aaron Nesmith has played against the Knicks four times and committed at least four fouls in all four of those games. Andrew Nembhard has committed 14 fouls in those four Knicks games. Indiana built a game plan around trying to defend Jalen Brunson one-on-one. They can't do that without fouling because, frankly, this is a very weak group of point-of-attack defenders. They started to show a bit of help at points late in the game, but the Knicks solved that defensive approach in the Philadelphia series. Ultimately, I just don't see a consistent way this group of Pacers can defend the Knicks, whereas Indiana's offense is relatively streaky and dependent on 3-pointers and fast-breaks. The Pick: Knicks -4.5\n\nWe've covered the fouling issues in this series. Another important pro-offense note here is how fast these teams were willing to play in Game 1. The Knicks and Pacers played at a 98-possession pace in Game 1. That's slow by regular-season standards, but faster than any team has averaged this postseason. There were 38 total fast-break points in the game. For reference, no team averaged more than 18.7 in the regular season. The Pacers want to play fast. They were the NBA's second-fastest regular-season team. The Knicks just played a full series at Philadelphia's glacial pace and now appear eager to stretch their legs a bit. The Pick: Over 222.5\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein's rebounding prop sounds tempting on paper. With Mitchell Robinson injured, he has to play a ton of minutes... right? Well, he played 36 minutes in Game 1 and pulled in only six rebounds. He hasn't reached double digits once this postseason. That doesn't mean he hasn't been valuable on the glass in the playoffs. Only OG Anunoby has more box outs in the playoffs, according to NBA.com tracking data. But when it comes to actually pulling down the board, that has been Josh Hart's department. There are just so many ways Hartenstein can come in below this number. Foul trouble. His Achilles injury acting up. Indiana aggressively boxing him out, clearing the way for other Knicks.

There were a number of silly passes made, including a few by Hart and one by Brunson being caught in the air.\n\nThe most egregious came via inbounds passes -- the Knicks had three turnovers related to inbounds plays, inexcusably shoddy execution. New York should look a lot better in Game 2 if they can cut down on simple mistakes like these.\n\nYou wouldn't think the Knicks almost lost Game 1 defensively, with Tyrese Haliburton only scoring six points and Siakam 19.

New York may be willing to live with that, but they shouldn't live with some of the shots he was getting.\n\nNew York showed a few coverages on Turner pick-and-rolls, depending on the ball-handler, but slipped up enough to allow him lots of strong looks. One way they can limit those is not giving up the Brunson switch on Turner as easily.\n\nThe Knicks purposefully switched Haliburton pick-and-rolls, but other times even while playing a drop, Brunson would end up on Turner right at the rim. He'll need to fight over screens better and his centers should lean towards Turner more, forcing non-Haliburton guards to score from mid-range or at the rim.\n\nOn most pick-and-pops, Turner actually swung free, and while he only converted 2-6 threes, the Knicks need to rotate out to him since he's one of Indiana's most reliable shooters. Those are better switching opportunities where he can't punish a guard as easily, or the Knicks can put Anunoby on him and a center on Siakam, if they decide to get more drastic.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGame 1 between the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden was a highly entertaining nail-biter. The home team narrowly won to take a 1-0 lead in the series. The Pacers will now look to focus on taking a road game before the series heads to Indiana for Games 3 and 4. However, they could have to do it without their All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nThe 24-year-old has been added to the NBA's latest injury report for Game 2 tonight at MSG. He has been listed as 'questionable' due to his lower back spasms, which has been a recurring issue for him this year.\n\nFrom past instances, it can be adjudged that the two-time All-Star will probably suit up for the contest even if his minutes are restricted. The two teams were separated by one point with 12.1 seconds left in Game 1, but the Knicks' sturdy defense and Jalen Brunson's clutch conversions from the free-throw line in the dying seconds helped New York start the series off on the right foot.\n\nTherefore, Haliburton will try to show up to work in Game 2 and set the tone for the Pacers' homestand. Because the series promises to be a dogfight, and a very closely contested affair.\n\nWhile it's unlikely that the Pacers would withhold Haliburton in Game 2, they'll take necessary precautions before fielding him against the Knicks, who've built a reputation for playing physical, hard-nosed defense. Losing Game 2 won't be as detrimental as losing the All-Star guard for an extended period.\n\nLosing Tyrese Haliburton for Game 2 against the Knicks would be a massive blow to the Pacers. The All-Star guard holds the keys to Indiana's offense and at times, their entire game plan revolves around his excellent playmaking. However, the Pacers have had a decent amount of practice of playing without their point guard.\n\nHaliburton missed 13 games during the regular season, the Pacers won seven and lost six in those. However, only three of their seven wins were against playoff teams. On the other hand, all six losses were against teams in top spots of the two Conferences. They haven't fared well when they've gone up against good teams without Haliburton.\n\nThe Pacers desperately need their All-Star guard to stay healthy and play well to stand a chance of upstaging the Knicks and booking their berth in the Eastern Conference Finals. This roster has already ended the franchise's 10-year wait for a playoff series win.\n\nCoincidentally, the last time the Pacers won a playoff series, they made it to the Conference championship series, where they were beaten in six games by LeBron James and the Heat. Haliburton and co. have the opportunity to end the Pacers' decade-long wait for an Eastern Conference Finals appearance, but it all hinges on their star guard's health.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_mahesh_lokegaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Jay Mahesh Lokegaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/7816cc67-nba-2024-05-08t181242.702.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Suffering two defeats in heartbreaking fashion is even more suboptimal. This is exactly what the Indiana Pacers experienced after they lost two very winnable games to start off their second-round matchup against the New York Knicks. In Game 2, the Pacers blew a double-digit first-half lead, letting a golden opportunity to steal homecourt advantage slip as the Knicks came storming back to finish with a 130-121 victory.\n\nBut the worst thing the Pacers could do now is to lose the mental game. It might be frustrating to lose two close games, especially when the opportunity to send the fans at Madison Square Garden home sad was right in their fingertips, but they absolutely cannot lose their composure. The good thing is that they remain focused on the job at hand, with Tyrese Haliburton staying confident in his team's ability to bounce back, especially with the series heading to Indianapolis.\n\n\"At the end of the day it's 2-0, we're going back to Indy and I like us in any matchup. I'm not worried,\" Haliburton said in his postgame presser, per the official NBA TV Twitter (X) account.\n\nThe Pacers are undefeated so far in the playoffs at home, and the crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse is always fired up come playoff time. There are plenty of reasons for Tyrese Haliburton and company to be confident, and they'll surely have all the incentive in the world to give it their all in Game 3 as they try to avoid going down 3-0 -- a death sentence -- in their matchup against the Knicks.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle was consumed by frustrations to end Game 2, with his last straw being the officials' decision to overturn what would have been a crucial double dribble call on Knicks center Isaiah Hartenstein. Carlisle was irate on the sidelines, and he racked up two technical fouls in quick succession shortly thereafter.\n\nBut Carlisle was not done yet; the Pacers head coach expressed his dismay over the officiating during his postgame presser, even pointing out a specific instance where Josh Hart blatantly shoved Tyrese Haliburton and got away with it in the third quarter.\n\nWhen the officiating doesn't go your way in crucial moments, it can be triggering. But the Pacers lost their way even before some of the calls purportedly went against them. The Pacers led by 10 at halftime of Game 2, and yet they ended the third quarter of the same game down by eight to the Knicks -- an 18-point turnaround in the third quarter alone.\n\nThe Pacers lost their rhythm offensively, and the Knicks, in addition to being very efficient from the field, crashed the glass with reckless abandon. New York, simply put, outplayed Indiana in the second half. Even Tyrese Haliburton admitted this.\n\n\"At the end of the day we got outplayed. We were right there to win the game. Would I like more consistency [from officials]? Yeah. But let's not pretend that's the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough. ... They outplayed us. Let's not pretend like the refs are the reason we lost. We just got to be better.\" Haliburton said.\n\nOne of the main stories coming out of Game 1 was that Tyrese Haliburton has to take more initiative in hunting his own shot. Haliburton finished with just six points on six shot attempts in the first game of the series, and his lackluster play was made all the more frustrating by the fact that the Pacers only lost by four.\n\nIn Game 2, Haliburton came out of the gates firing; he finished with 22 first-half points as he looked to be more aggressive, and the Pacers benefitted from it. He was on fire from beyond the arc, and Indiana went out and built a double-digit lead thanks in large part to his efforts.\n\nOf course, the second half was a different story. Haliburton was mostly invisible as the Knicks came roaring back with a 36-18 third quarter. Defending became a struggle for the Pacers as they were caught in a feedback loop, allowing plenty of opportunities for the Knicks to attack a defense that wasn't quite set as Indiana went ice cold from the field.\n\nHaliburton still finished with 34 points to lead all scorers, and this newfound aggression only bodes well for the Pacers moving forward. In front of a raucous Gainbridge Fieldhouse crowd, Haliburton now has to sustain this level of play, or even elevate it even further, as Indiana looks to avoid falling into an insurmountable series deficit on Friday night.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pacers-Tyrese-Haliburton-shares-eye-opening-claim-that-will-hype-up-fans-despite-2-0-deficit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

After a check-up in the locker room, Brunson went to the court for warmups and wound up playing the second half for New York.\n\nThe official injury report revealed that Brunson dealt with a foot injury, but there were also some pains in his groin.\n\nIn the postgame interview, Brunson spoke on his availability for Game 3 and he said \"Trying to be,\" when commenting on whether he'll play or not.\n\nThis would be a major blow for the Knicks, but they hold a comfortable lead heading into Indiana.\n\nRelated: Josh Hart Helped Deliver Knicks Fans' Vulgar Message To Reggie Miller In Game 2\n\nRelated: Knicks Fans Deliver Blunt Three-Word Chant To Reggie Miller During Knicks-Pacers", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/b8/9b8a303d-c077-5c93-b01c-a2104260b8b3/663c480f8669d.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

A controversial kickball call that favored the Knicks with just under a minute left in regulation helped break the back of Indiana, which suffered a 121-117 loss to Jalen Brunson and company.\n\nWith the game tied at 115-115, Brunson tried to make a pass to Donte DiVincenzo but the ball was knocked off its course by Pacers small forward Aaron Nesmith, who was called for a kickball even though replays showed that it did not hit him in the foot. The call went unchallenged and with the Knicks retaining possession, DiVincenzo scored a huge 3-pointer that put New York ahead -- for good.\n\nFor the record, such a violation is not reviewable. Only fouls, goaltends, and out of bounds calls are allowed by the NBA to be challenged.\n\nIt got worse for the Pacers when center Myles Turner was slapped with an offensive foul after setting a screen for Tyrese Haliburton. Indiana challenged that foul but the call stood.\n\nPacers' Rick Carlisle, Myles Turner sound off on officiating\n\nCarlisle kept his emotions in check when he offered his thoughts on the officiating in the contest.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating. We're not expecting to get calls here. It would be nice if they (Tyler Ford) laid off that one (Turner's offensive foul) but they didn't so that's just the way it goes,\" Carlisle said after the game.\n\nTurner also voiced out his frustrations about how the refs handled the officiating ((via Tony East of All Pacers on SI)).\n\n\"In my experience in this league, I think it's best when players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said . He added that the Pacers can't leave the game to be decided by the refs, though he added he's looking forwad to the Last 2 Minutes report coming out.\n\nThe pool report about the kickball call will also not make Carlisle and the Pacers feel any better.\n\n\"On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation. Post game review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal,\" crew chief Zach Zarba said when asked about whether the call on Nesmith was the correct one.\n\nSocial media reactions to officiating in Game 1\n\n\"Refs called this a kick ball and the Pacers lost out on a fast break layup..... What is going on???? @OfficialNBARefs,\" said @AidanLaPorta69.\n\n\"Pacers got robbed of a transition opportunity on the Haliburton steal, robbed of another steal because of the kicked ball call, and then the incredibly soft moving screen. I'm really really not a blame the refs guy, but that was brutal,\" posted @RohanNadkarni.\n\n\"NO WAY!!! Refs called this an offensive foul on the Pacers. Pacers challenge the call but how is this called with 12 seconds left?,\" shared @Rate_the_Refs.\n\nFrom @PacersStatsMuse: \"The whole world just saw the refs rig a game for the Knicks on the biggest stage.

The Knicks never trailed for the remaining time and went on to win Game 1; final score 121-117.\n\n\"A kicked ball violation is not reviewable and not subject to the coach's challenge,\" Zabra said. \"The three things that teams can challenge are fouls, goaltends and out of bounds.\"\n\nAfter making that 3-pointer, DiVo completed another -- perhaps even more important -- action, this time on defense.\n\nTyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner planned to run a play with the latter big boy screening the latter but DiVincenzo crashed into Turner, fell to the hardwood, and refs called MT for an offensive foul on the Knicks guard with just 12 seconds left.\n\nThere is no doubt that was a moving screen, however, and although it was a close call it was the right one, and not enough evidence was found to overturn the ruling on the court. The Pacers tried to swing the refs' opinion on it, but not even going through an endless amount of replays convinced the officials.\n\nSpeaking after Game 1, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle acknowledge they \"were not expecting to get calls in here,\" after saying he \"doesn't want to talk about the officiating.\"\n\nSaid Carlisle: \"It would be nice if they laid off [the illegal screen], but that's just the way it goes. We challenged it, they reviewed it. They've got a bunch of people in New Jersey that agreed with it, that's just the way it goes. We gotta learn from that, too. That's a timing play, both guys are involved. We'll have to execute that better next time.\"\n\nThe offender in the play, Myles Turner, said he'd rather play under streetball rules than NBA's.\n\n\"I think it's best when players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said in his postgame press conference. \"I think it's unfortunate that it happened. We reviewed it; they still called it an illegal screen.\n\n\"But it's the playoffs, man. I feel like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it.\"\n\nPacers guard T.J. McConnell, who dropped \u00ba8 points off the pine in 22 minutes and was better than most -- if not all -- of his teammates, had something closer to reality to say after the game regarding the final minute of play.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" he said about whether or not a different pair of calls would have changed the game's outcome. \"There were plays that we could have made that it doesn't even come down to that. Unfortunate, but we got to move on and fix things that we didn't do well.\"\n\nAll of the above, the whole 650+ words, were going to be a separate article published here on P&T today, along with the customary Recap and the Bulletin.\n\nI decided to bunch this L2M report and the Recap into a single piece because well, it's the thing that everybody is going to talk about today and before Game 2 takes place on Wednesday.

The mob watching him had awaited his arrival for long enough that Madison Square Garden was tense.\n\nBrunson departed Wednesday's game near the end of the first quarter because of a foot injury. The building immediately lost its verve. The Knicks' top player, the man who had just finished fifth in MVP voting earlier that evening, had mysteriously vanished, questionable to return with an ambiguous injury: right foot soreness.\n\nIn one moment, the gusto came back. If you could not see Brunson's emergence from the tunnel, you would have heard it.\n\nHe jogged out unperturbed with minutes to go until the start of the third quarter and walked onto the court as the crowd offered a standing ovation, which he did not acknowledge. He strolled to the free-throw line, where Josh Hart greeted him for a second, then let him be. Brunson had work to do.\n\nFrom then on, Brunson was by himself. He tested out free throws, then stepbacks in the mid-range, then 3s off the dribble, then drives, then back to 3s. Chants of \"MVP!\" roared from the stands. Brunson, as he often carries himself, appeared unaffected.\n\n\"It was really cool to hear,\" Brunson said. \"But I just knew I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half.\"\n\nUntil that moment, it wasn't clear if Brunson would play again. The All-Star guard had asked out of the game with three and a half minutes to go in the first quarter, an out-of-character move. He said he's not sure on which play the injury occurred. But he must have been in pain.\n\n\"Once I went on the court I was going to give it a go, no matter what,\" Brunson said.\n\nWith each jumper that he rehearsed, an even more extreme sentiment became obvious. Not only would Brunson play, but there was no chance he would exit again.\n\nBrunson ran for the entire second half on an injured foot, going for 24 points just in the third and fourth quarters, and leading the Knicks to a 130-121 victory in Game 2 of New York's second-round playoff series against Indianapolis. It now leads the series 2-0.\n\n\"He's a warrior,\" Hart said. \"We know he wants to be out there. It was great for him to be out there, great for him to finish the game. Hopefully, he's not too sore tomorrow. But this team has fight. That's what we're built off of.\"\n\nThis is the identity of the Knicks. They are filled with Kool-Aid men -- players who burst through walls and are built to take a punch.\n\nThey lose Mitchell Robinson for the postseason, as the team announced Tuesday night, and Precious Achiuwa steps in. OG Anunoby hurts a hamstring, as he did on Wednesday, an injury that occurred during his arguably best game since coming to New York more than four months ago, and Hart or Donte DiVincenzo fill the void.\n\nHart never sits. He's the first player to go two consecutive playoff games without subbing out since Jimmy Butler in 2013, a situation without any obvious common denominators.\n\nMost importantly, they climbed on the back of Brunson, who finished with 29 points and five assists.\n\n\"When he's out there, there's a level of calmness,\" DiVincenzo said. \"We'll get the right shot every single time. There's a level of confidence from everybody that we have him on the court with us. Everybody can settle down and play their own game.\"\n\nIt shows.\n\nThe Knicks could have lost this game and shrugged their shoulders afterward.\n\nBrunson missed more than a quarter, as did Anunoby. They didn't receive much from the bench. Achiuwa improved his defensive performance in the fourth quarter but struggled early. Miles \"Deuce\" McBride took over as the primary facilitator with Brunson out but could not get the offense going.\n\nBut this is what separates a merely solid team from one that places itself only two wins away from the Eastern Conference finals. Sometimes, you have to win the games you're not supposed to win.\n\nSometimes, Brunson goes down, but Anunoby takes over in his stead. The 26-year-old had throttled to 28 points before limping to the locker room in the third quarter, holding his left hamstring. Head coach Tom Thibodeau said after the game that he did not have an update on the forward's status.\n\nSometimes, a defense traps Brunson, as the Pacers did in the second half, even when it wasn't clear if Brunson could move at 100 percent capabilities, and the point guard gives up the ball for others to make plays. That's when Isaiah Hartenstein -- who finished with 14 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists -- whipped passes to shooters and cutters. It's when DiVincenzo -- who finished with 28 points, six rebounds and four assists on 6-of-12 3-point shooting -- drained jumpers because Indiana's defenders strayed from him on the arc.\n\nSometimes, a team has Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 and Robinson out for the postseason, then fights through a game where Brunson and Anunoby both miss significant time. In those moments, bench help isn't as important because Hart -- who finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists -- needs to go to the nearest hospital so doctors can study how a human being acquires limitless energy.\n\nSometimes, the basketball gods, even as they rip apart a team with injury after injury, also sprinkle in a blessing. Brunson's return came on the 54th anniversary of Willis Reed's.\n\nBrunson just scored 40-plus points in four consecutive playoff games. The night the streak snapped was one when he pulled his own Reed.\n\nSometimes, if it goes on for long enough, a run becomes special.\n\n\"There was no doubt in our minds that he'd be back,\" DiVincenzo said. \"All season long no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_katz@theathletic.com", "name": "Fred Katz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Indiana recorded a 52.3% shooting accuracy, hit 10 3-pointers and committed just eight turnovers.\n\nOver seven playoff games, the team has averaged 113.6 points per game, the second highest in the postseason. The Pacers have a shooting percentage of 48.5% from the field and 34.8% from beyond the arc, with an average of 13.4 3-pointers and 13 free throws per game in the postseason.\n\nDefensively, Indiana had difficulties containing the Knicks and were also outrebounded, contributing to the narrow margin. The Pacers have averaged 42.1 rebounds during the playoffs, while their opponents have averaged slightly more at 42.3 per game.\n\nIndiana's defense has allowed opponents to score an average of 111.7 points per game and shoot 48.2% from the field, while it has averaged 5.1 steals and 4.6 blocks per game. Additionally, the Pacers' average of 8.7 turnovers per game is the lowest in the postseason.\n\nMyles Turner spearheaded the offense with a team-high 23 points, shooting 8 for 16 from the field. However, the center managed only two rebounds. Tyrese Haliburton, entering the series with an average of 16.0 points per game in the playoffs, scored just six points in Game 1. Despite the low scoring, he led the team with eight assists and four steals.\n\nWhat happened to Tyrese Haliburton?\n\nTyrese Haliburton sustained a hamstring strain with 3:10 left in the second quarter of the 133-131 win against the Boston Celtics on Jan. 8.\n\nThe injury occurred when he tried to move past Derrick White, but an unexpected defensive shift by Kristaps Porzingis forced Haliburton to abruptly stop, causing him to split. Unable to support himself on his legs, Haliburton required assistance to leave the court and was subsequently declared out for the rest of the game.\n\nHow to watch Indiana Pacers vs New York Knicks?\n\nThe marquee Game 2 between the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks will tipoff at 8 p.m. EDT at Madison Square Garden.

The Knicks' star point guard has been labeled questionable to return.\n\nAs the Knicks' primary men continue to vanish Thanos snap-style, Anunoby is turning himself into a Swiss Army Knick: with Mitchell Robinson out, Anunoby got things started in the interior and then went to work on the outside. The Knicks could obviously use some help on the defensive front, but there's no denying that Anunoby's scoring is keeping New York in the game this time around.\n\nHas Brunson's injury ... helped the Knicks? It might be if their ragtag group of remainders has anything to say about it: with Burnson out until further notice, Tyrese Haliburton firing on all cylinders, and holding a double-figure lead at halftime, the potential comeback has all the makings of a backbreaker before the series shifts venues. Indiana is also completing one of the essential tasks: winning the rebounding battle. The Knicks are 4-13 in the rare cases they've lost the board blows and they're currently at minus-three 24 minutes in.\n\nThere's no denying it anymore: it's time for the Knicks to end Alec Burks' exile, especially if Brunson is unable to carry on. It's quite clear that this one will be decided from deep and that was one of the reasons why a Burks reunion was deemed so necessary at deadline season. No one's going to argue that Burks is putting the ultimate \"V\" in MVP, but expanding the rotation immediately could be the best way to give the Knicks a fighting chance.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The win gives the Knicks a 2-0 lead in the series as they head to Indianapolis for Friday's Game 3.\n\n\"Just a lot of toughness. We all know his makeup,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said of Brunson. \"The mental toughness is so important. It's about being the best when the best is needed, even when you aren't feeling well.\"\n\nIt was yet another remarkable chapter in what has been a remarkable playoff series for the Knicks All-Star guard.\n\nMuch too do had been made before the game about the fact Brunson could pass Michael Jordan and become just the second NBA player ever to score 40 points in five consecutive games. While that did not come to pass, what he did buy rejoining his team was even more legendary.\n\nNo player has been more important to his team this postseason than Brunson, who entered Wednesday night's game at Madison Square Garden having scored 43, 41, 40 and 47 in his last four games. The only other players to have scored 40 or more points in four consecutive playoff games are Jerry West, who had a six-game streak, Michael Jordan (four) and Bernard King (four).\n\nThat's why you could almost hear a collective gasp go up in the Garden when Brunson asked out of the game after appearing to suffer a noncontact injury. When he didn't come back for the entire second quarter, an air of panic seemed to settle in.\n\nThe Knicks have survived the loss of Julius Randle this season and are surviving the loss of Mitchell Robinson. Brunson, however, is the one payer they cannot do without.\n\nDespite the fact that Brunson entered the game having the best postseason of any player in the league, averaging a league best 36.6 points in seven games against the 76ers and the Pacers, he did not get a single first place vote in the MVP voting that was announced half an hour before the game.\n\nNikola Jokic was a runaway winner with 926 votes. He was followed by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brunson, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, Domantas Sabonis and Kevin Durant.\n\nThe Denver big man had once again dominated the regular season on the way to earning the MVP award for the third time in his nine-year career.\n\nStill, would Jokic be a repeat winner if media members voted the day after the NBA Finals instead of the day after the last day of the season? Considering that Jokic's Nuggets team is 0-2 against Minnesota in their second-round playoff series, one has to wonder.\n\nJokic was a runaway winner with 926 votes. He was followed by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brunson, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, Domantas Sabonis and Kevin Durant.\n\nIn his pregame news conference before the voting was announced, Thibodeau said he thinks it makes sense to wait to after the postseason to take the vote.\n\n\"What is it?

He saw that some \"kid named Donte DiVincenzo from Delaware\" had committed to Villanova and that he was a guard like him. So, he decided to go to YouTube and check the guy out.\n\n\"I went and watched, and I was like, well, alright. I guess I'm not going to Villanova,\" Brunson remembered after the Knicks practice Tuesday. \"And then we actually played against each other that summer (in AAU) and he said, \"come to 'Nova with me.' And I said 'hell, no.'\"\n\nOf course, not only did Brunson join DiVincenzo at Villanova and win two national championships with him there, he returned the favor by helping to recruit DiVincenzo to the Knicks this season where he is playing a critical role in their postseason.\n\nIn fact, as much as Brunson is the MVP and leader of this team, an argument can be made that it's the play of DiVincenzo, especially late in the game, that has often determined whether the Knicks win or lose.\n\nBrunson became just the fourth NBA player ever to score 40 or more points in four consecutive playoff games Monday, but it was DiVincenzo who made the two plays on both sides of the ball that clinched the Knicks' 121-117 win in Game 1 of their second-round series against the Pacers.\n\nFirst, DiVincenzo buried a clutch three on a pass from Brunson that gave the Knicks the lead for good with 40 seconds left. Then, with 12.1 seconds left, he drew a controversial offensive foul by running into an illegal screen by Miles Turner when he was guarding Tyrese Haliburton and the Pacers trailed by a point.\n\nThe Pacers challenged the call. So did a number of pundits, including Stan Van Gundy on TNT, who called it \"a great acting job\" by DiVincenzo. Officials, however, upheld the call and so did the league's Last 2-Minute Reportwhen released on Tuesday.\n\nOf course, it was not the first time in the playoffs that DiVincenzo had come up with a huge shot in the final seconds. His three-pointer at the end of Game 2 against Philadelphia at Madison Square Garden capped a crazy sequence that allowed the Knicks to basically steal the win.\n\nDiVincenzo is the first player since Ray Allen in 2009 to make multiple go-ahead threes in the final minute of a fourth quarter. Dating to 1997, only four others have done it -- Rashard Lewis (2009), Michael Finley (2006), Robert Horry (2002) and John Stockton (1997). Not bad company to be in.\n\nThere have also been stretches in the postseason where DiVincenzo has struggled. After hitting the game-winner in Game 2 against the 76ers, he totaled 22 points while shooting 8-for-28 over the next three games. The Knicks were 1-2 in those games.\n\n\"I believe every shot that I shoot is going in,\" DiVincenzo said when asked how he comes back when he has been struggling.\n\nThis is something that Tom Thibodeau loves about him.\n\n\"Donte is very confident when he shoots. He's surprised if he misses,\" the Knicks coach said. \"So, the next one is going up, you know . . . But it's not a false bravado, because he puts an incredible amount of work into the game.\"\n\nDiVincenzo's contributions are even more impressive when you consider that he is often given one of the tougher defensive assignments on the floor. After guarding Tyrese Maxey in Game 6 against the 76ers, DiVincenzo was assigned to be the primary defender on Haliburton, the Pacers' All-Star guard, on Monday. Haliburton, who has been suffering from lower back pain, dished out eight assists and grabbed three steals but was held to six points and took just six shots.\n\nBrunson couldn't be happier to have DiVincenzo stepping up in the playoffs, especially since he once thought they would never play together.\n\n\"Obviously, it's pretty cool seeing a guy who you thought you probably wouldn't be teammates with, let alone friends with, is now one of your best friends, and he's hitting a clutch shot,\" Brunson said. \"It's a real cool sight to see, but knowing him and his mindset, he forgot about it once he woke up this morning. He's just ready to move on.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type":

Jalen Brunson injured his foot and missed the entire second quarter. Many thought he was done for the night before JB returned in the second half and erupted for 24 points to clinch the crucial victory.\n\nOG Anunoby was also injured in Game 2. He did not return and adds to the mounting list of ailments for New York. It will not be easy finishing off the Pacers, and it only gets tougher from here. Some will be quick to write the Knicks off, but Brunson reaching a new level makes them a threat.\n\nJB's Willis Reed moment cemented his status as a superstar. He is one of the best players in the league and lifts his team to new heights. There is no questioning Brunson's greatness, and this is only the beginning.\n\nHe has exceeded expectations his entire life. Brunson was barely a top 20 player coming out of high school but won two NCAA championships and National Player of the Year at Villanova. NBA scouts questioned his size and role during the draft process. It caused him to slip into the second round where the Mavericks were happy to pounce. Brunson went from reserve to starter to their second-best player in Dallas before signing with the Knicks in 2022.\n\nMany thought Brunson's four-year $104 million deal was an overpay, but nobody is saying that now. Jay Williams declared he thinks JB can be the number one on a title team on May 9.\n\nBrunson is averaging 35.6 points, 8.1 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 0.9 steals in 42.4 minutes per game during these playoffs. He has been the NBA's top postseason scorer and just went for 29 on 11 of 18 shooting with an injured foot for the majority of the game.\n\nBrunson is a superstar because he is an unstoppable offensive force. He will weave his way into the paint and find a way to score. Some are quick to dismiss him because JB does not fit the prototype, but keep doubting him. Brunson thrives on it. Yes, he is undersized and not the most explosive athlete. He just finished fifth in MVP voting and will earn his first All-NBA honors. Brunson has arrived and is showing zeros signs of slowing down.\n\nJalen Brunson has outplayed Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, Tyrese Haliburton, and nearly every player in the league in these playoffs. Fans can make a case for him being the top point guard in the league. JB always shines when the lights are brightest, and it is not stopping now. He has the Knicks feeling like legit title contenders, and the 27-year-old is just entering his prime.\n\nJalen Brunson has become a superstar on the New York Knicks, and the best is still yet to come.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIndiana Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle on Monday was in no mood to discuss the officiating after his team's series-opening loss to the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Pacers fell to the Knicks 121-117 in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal matchup at Madison Square Garden in New York City, N.Y.\n\nIndiana held a lead for the majority of the fourth quarter but could not hold on until the final buzzer. One controversial call loomed large on the final result.\n\nWith less than 20 seconds left in the contest, the Pacers had possession while trailing 118-117. But before Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton could make a move, Myles Turner was whistled for an offensive foul on a moving screen.\n\nDuring his postgame press conference, Carlisle was asked about the call. The Pacers coach said that he's not surprised the Knicks got a favorable whistle.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating. We're not expecting to get calls in here,\" said Carlisle.\n\n\"It would've been nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. That's just the way it goes.\"\n\nThe Pacers also got burned by a kicked ball call a few possessions earlier.

I hate when a basketball game ends with a dozen whistles in the final minute.\n\nIn today's SI:AM:\n\n\ud83e\udd93 Was this a foul?\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u2642\ufe0f What was Jamal Murray thinking?\n\n\ud83d\ude1e What happened to center fielders?\n\nThe NBA's Last Two Minute report from Game 1 of the series between the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers is going to be a doozy.\n\nThe Knicks won the game, 121-117, behind another explosive scoring night from Jalen Brunson, who had 43 points to become the first player since Michael Jordan to score at least 40 points in four straight playoff games. But the Knicks also benefited significantly from several questionable officiating decisions down the stretch in a tight game.\n\nThe most crucial and most controversial was the offensive foul call on Pacers center Myles Turner with 12.1 seconds left. The play came immediately after a Knicks turnover gave Indiana new life, with New York leading 118-117 and the Pacers able to hold the ball for the last shot. Tyrese Haliburton brought the ball across halfcourt, guarded by Donte DiVincenzo. Turner came up to set a screen on DiVincenzo and DiVincenzo crumpled to the floor as if he'd been stuck by a cattle prod. Turner was whistled for a moving screen, giving the ball back to the Knicks and effectively ending any hopes of a Pacers comeback. (The Pacers challenged the call but it was upheld on review.)\n\nWere Turner's feet still moving when he set the screen? Sure. Slightly. By the letter of the law, it's a foul. But it's a marginal call at best, and not the type of foul that usually gets called at that stage in a playoff game.\n\n\"I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said after the game. \"I think it's unfortunate that it happened. We reviewed it; they still called it an illegal screen. But it's the playoffs, man. I feel like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it. For the most part you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. So we have to take accountability as well. Of course it's right after the game, I'm a little fresh in my emotions about it, but we know, at the end of the day, we can't get to that position.\n\n\"The Last Two Minute report, we're all looking forward to that coming out. I think there was two controversial calls. We had to use our challenge on one call on Tyrese [Haliburton]. And then the kickball by Aaron Nesmith that was not a kickball -- you can clearly see it on the replay.\"\n\nWhile the moving screen call is debatable, there's no doubt that Turner is right about the missed call on Nesmith. With 52 seconds left to play and the score tied at 115, Brunson tried to sneak a pass to DiVincenzo in transition. Nesmith deflected the pass, but the officials ruled that he did so with his foot, which is illegal, and the Knicks retained possession. In fact, video shows that Nesmith clearly deflected the pass with his hand, but the call was not reviewable.\n\nThe blown call denied the Pacers a fastbreak opportunity in the final minute of a tied game. Instead, immediately after the Knicks got the ball back, DiVincenzo hit a dagger three. Crew chief Zach Zarba told a pool reporter after the game that the call was incorrect.\n\nThe bad calls weren't the only reason the Pacers lost. One other reason was that Haliburton made several questionable decisions in the final minutes (he had three turnovers in the last four minutes of the game). But when playing against a quality opponent in a raucous road environment, it's next to impossible to win when you also have to overcome uneven officiating.\n\nThe other game on Monday night was equally interesting, but not equally competitive. In Game 2 of their series, the Minnesota Timberwolves eviscerated the Denver Nuggets, 106-80, to take a 2-0 lead in the series.\n\nThe result was notable for a few reasons. First of all, Minnesota was playing without center Rudy Gobert, who was away from the team awaiting the birth of his first child. Even without Gobert, the favorite to win his fourth Defensive Player of the Year award, the Timberwolves' defense still held Denver to its fewest points since Game 7 of the 2020 first round against the Jazz (an 80-78 win for the Nuggets).\n\nThe loss also marked just the second time during the Nikola Joki\u0107 era that the Nuggets lost back-to-back home playoff games. The only other time was when the Phoenix Suns finished off a four-game sweep in Denver in the 2021 second round. The Nuggets were nearly unbeatable at home during their championship run last season, losing just one game in Denver (Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat). But the T-Wolves are just that good. Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns were excellent again in Game 2, combining for 54 points on just 32 shots. It'll be an uphill battle for the Nuggets to come back and win the series after squandering home-court advantage so dramatically.\n\n... things I saw last night:\n\n5.Joel Embiid's tweet after the moving screen call on Myles Turner.\n\n4.Shohei Ohtani's 441-foot blast for his MLB-leading 11th homer of the season.

Julius Randle dislocated his shoulder in January (and eventually had surgery), Bojan Bogdanovic hurt his foot in round one and had surgery, and Mitchell Robinson suffered a \"stress injury\" in his ankle in the Knicks' Game 1 semifinals win against the Pacers. Keep in mind that Robinson missed more than three months earlier in the season after he had ankle surgery.\n\nThe one player New York can't afford to lose is Jalen Brunson. Guess what happened in Game 2? In the first quarter, it appeared that Brunson hurt his hand. He didn't start the second quarter because he was in the locker room. Knicks fans anxiously awaited an update, only to learn that the point guard was questionable to return with a sore right foot.\n\nHere's the play in which it seems Brunson injured his foot:\n\nBrunson and the Knicks are used to playing through pain, so it's telling that he immediately asked for a sub.\n\nBrunson was 2-for-2 from the field for five points in eight minutes before he exited the game. He's on a four-game streak of scoring 40+ points, which will most likely end on Wednesday, given he missed the end of the first quarter and the entire second quarter.\n\nThe good news is that OG Anunoby put up 22 points in the first half on 8-of-15 shooting. He's been attacking the paint, a tactic that's worked well. Outside of Anunoby, Josh Hart is the only other Knick who has scored in double digits at the half with 10 points on 4-of-4 shooting. New York needs Deuce McBride, who has four points on 1-of-4 shooting, to come alive in the second half.\n\nBrunson's injury led to Alec Burks checking into the game with less than a minute left in the second quarter. He hasn't played since April 12, if that tells you how desperate the Knicks are.\n\nLuckily, Brunson was back on the court for the start of the second half. His foot is still bothering him, but it's obviously a good sign that he returned. Hopefully, the injury isn't serious, and he'll be fine for the rest of the series.", "source": {"uri": "dailyknicks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Knicks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4712,h_2650,x_0,y_82/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/27/01hxde3kvmrf9veq4n2t.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-12", "textStart": 1765, "textEnd": 1773}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

And there's Spike Lee, taunting him yet again! And oh wow, there's John Starks on the baseline, next to Stephon Marbury! And over there, Bernard King! And Latrell Sprewell! And Clyde Frazier! And is that [rubs eyes] Willis Reed, limping back to save the day yet again?\n\nIt might sound like the fever dream of a delirious New Yorker who's ingested too many $6 slices and $15 beers but that was, more or less, the scene Wednesday night at the Garden, as the Knicks fought off another round of injuries and another furious charge by the Indiana Pacers to take a 130-121 victory and a 2-0 lead in their second-round playoff series.\n\nTo be clear, yes that was Reggie Miller (calling the game for TNT), and that was Spike Lee (who arrived with two framed tabloids invoking the 1990s rivalry), and all those former Knicks were indeed scattered around the court, infusing the evening with a thick layer of nostalgia -- continuing a recently adopted Garden tradition that has included playoff cameos by Bill Bradley, Carmelo Anthony, Patrick Ewing, and Larry Johnson.\n\nBut no, there was no temporal rift at 33rd Street and 7th Avenue. And no, that was not actually Willis Reed limping back onto the court to save the day again. Just Jalen Brunson, the Knicks' unflappable, indefatigable, indestructible 6-foot-2 guard, defying the odds and the pain once more to lead the Knicks to victory, despite missing the entire second quarter with an unspecified foot injury.\n\nBrunson scored 29 points -- 24 in the second half on that troublesome foot -- adding another riveting chapter to his rapidly expanding legend.\n\n\"He's a warrior,\" his teammate Donte DiVincenzo said, and even he seemed almost in awe, despite having seen Brunson repeat this pattern all season. \"There was no doubt in our minds [during the first half] that he'll be back. All season long, no matter what is thrown at him, no injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back.\"\n\n\"Bouncing back\" would be an apt slogan for the Knicks' 2023-24 season, if the \"bouncing\" part didn't sound so risky, given all the sprains and strains and dislocations they've sustained -- and are still enduring.\n\nThey lost Julius Randle, their All-NBA forward, months ago. They lost Bojan Bogdanovic, their primary backup, a few weeks ago. They lost center Mitchell Robinson a few days ago. None will be returning this season. On Wednesday they lost Brunson for a period, and after he returned they lost OG Anunoby, to a hamstring injury that looked potentially serious. Before going down, Anunoby had put up a career playoff-high 28 points, helping the Knicks survive Brunson's absence. Meanwhile, Josh Hart played all 48 minutes for the second straight game, bringing his postseason average to a staggering 46.8 minutes over eight games. Coach Tom Thibodeau's rotation is down to seven players -- and that's not counting a potential absence from Anunoby.\n\nThe Knicks are rapidly running out of spare parts, and yet they somehow stand just two wins away from their first Eastern Conference finals appearance since 2000, when Ewing, Sprewell, and Johnson were still playing, Thibodeau was a Knicks assistant, and Rick Brunson (Jalen's dad) was a reserve guard. That group, of course, fell in the conference finals to Miller's Pacers -- the third straight spring those teams would clash in the playoffs.\n\nMost of the current Knicks have no ties to that rivalry, but it didn't stop Hart from approaching Miller and playfully telling him that fans were chanting , \"Fuck you!\" at him during the fourth quarter. Just like old times.\n\nTo call this current Knicks team injury-riddled would be an understatement. To call them resilient would seem utterly insufficient. To call them tough or determined or scrappy now borders on clich\u00e9, but those adjectives are all as unavoidable as they are accurate. It all starts with Brunson, the second-round pick, who became the surprising $104 million free agent, who became the even more surprising All-Star, and who on Wednesday finished fifth in the MVP balloting.\n\n\"We know that's his makeup,\" Thibodeau said, \"but that's also the makeup of our team. ... The mental toughness piece is so important. The ability to get through things, to be at your best when your best is needed, even when you may not be feeling your best. That's who he is. And a great leader.\"\n\nWith so many Knicks alumni in the crowd and so much nostalgia in the air, the historical references became irresistible. Sure enough, Wednesday was the 54th anniversary of Reed's legendary Game 7 appearance in the 1970 Finals, when he hobbled out to the Garden floor, despite a torn muscle in his right thigh, igniting the crowd and inspiring his teammates. The Knicks beat the Lakers to win the title that day, and Willis Reed was instantly enshrined as the patron saint of athletes pushing through injury.\n\nBut it's rare that a player having his \"Willis Reed moment\" actually does so just yards away from the tunnel where Willis Reed himself once famously emerged. (The tunnel itself is gone, buried under the seating the Garden installed as part of a $1 billion renovation completed in 2013.) Even the current Knicks, all of whom were born in the 1990s or later, couldn't resist the comparisons.\n\n\"Aight, Willis,\" Hart said to Brunson in the postgame locker room (per SNY's Ian Begley). Of course, Reed's moment inspired a championship. Brunson's, a mere Game 2 victory in the second round. Then again, Reed just hit a pair of jump shots and let Frazier do the rest. Brunson, as he has all season, carried the Knicks every minute he was on the court.\n\nTypical of Brunson -- who is both unfailingly modest and guarded -- he would not describe the injury (\"Just felt a little discomfort\"), nor offer any real insight into what happened, what he thought in the moment or how he managed to return for the third quarter. The results said everything. So did the response from the Garden crowd.\n\nThe mere sight of Brunson taking the court, with about 5 minutes left of halftime, triggered a mighty roar, followed by \"MVP\" chants and \"Jaaa-len Brunnn-son\" chants.\n\n\"This place has been nothing but special for me, so I appreciate everything they do,\" said Brunson, whose father Rick is now an assistant coach. He called the chants \"really cool to hear,\" adding, \"But I just knew I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half.\"\n\nThe Pacers showed their own brand of resilience, with star guard Tyrese Haliburton erupting for 34 points and nine assists after a shockingly quiet Game 1 performance. Five other Pacers scored in double figures. They led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter. None of it was enough.\n\nThe Knicks keep losing bodies.

New York, get ready, you're going to see them,\" Carlisle said. \"We deserve a fair shot... there's not a consistent balance, that's disappointing.\"\n\nThe Knicks are a physical team, which Carlisle pointed out. He also said Indiana's physicality is getting punished with whistles far more often than New York's in this series.\n\nStill, the Knicks' 22-17 free-throw advantage in Game 2 wasn't exactly a particularly significant one. Plus, Indiana had a double-digit lead and failed to capitalize even though the home team was without OG Anunoby for the fourth quarter after he was ruled out with a hamstring injury.\n\nThen there was Jalen Brunson, who spent much of the first half in the locker room with a sore right foot. Even with those injuries, the Pacers lost by nine points with a final deficit that suggests the outcome didn't come down to one or two calls.\n\nYet this may be lingering frustration from Game 1, which was determined in part by poor officiating.\n\nThe NBA's last-two-minute report from that contest revealed the officials mistakenly whistled Aaron Nesmith for a kicked ball violation in the final minute with the game tied.

The Pacers filed protests against 49 calls in Game 2, which they felt were incorrect and gave the Knicks an advantage. This comes in addition to protesting 29 calls in Game 1.\n\nThe question of fair officiating vs. big market bias been a long-term talking point among NBA fans, toeing the line of being a conspiracy theory. It's difficult to make a determination on whether Indiana has a point or not without seeing the calls in question -- but fans have noticed extremely uneven officiating in the series.\n\n\"Knicks refs\" was a trending topic on Twitter Wednesday night, with fans questioning why an incorrect double dribble call on Donte DiVincenzo was overturned in crunch time on Wednesday, but refs didn't consider reviewing an incorrect kicked ball foul on the Pacers in Game 1.\n\nThe nature of how both games unfolded is part of the discussion here. Twice in a row the Pacers have come out strong, only to see their leads evaporate in the second half amid a Knicks comeback. In total the officiating gives a slight edge to New York in fouls, with 39 being called against the Pacers to 33 for the Knicks -- but Tyrese Haliburton isn't willing to use the officiating as an excuse for his team's struggles.\n\nRick Carlisle's gripes with officiating aren't dissimilar to those of Daryl Morey during the 2018 Playoffs when his (then) Rockets faced the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. In that series Morey similarly protested numerous calls that went Golden State's way, though it didn't end up amounting to anything.\n\nIt's extremely unlikely the league office will admit that their officials made any significant mistakes in the series. If anything the Pacers will hope it might check the perceived bias the referees have for the remaining games in this series. That said, it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that Indiana don't have an answer for Jalen Brunson in this series, while uneven play from Myles Turner and Aaron Nesmith has allowed the Knicks to dominate the front court.\n\nIndiana needs to find an answer, and appealing to the NBA about bad reffing ain't it.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dator@sbnation.com", "name": "James Dator", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xh0JKGwylA_jsZj2Zw_bVAlhp4s=/0x0:2630x1315/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440121/usa_today_23224756.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Pacers forward Aaron Nesmith was whistled for a kicked ball violation that negated a steal for his team and allowed the Knicks to maintain possession before Donte DiVincenzo hit a go-ahead three-pointer.\n\nIt turns out, Indiana should have had the ball:\n\nUnfortunately for the visitors, a kicked ball violation is not reviewable.\n\n\"A kicked ball is not reviewable and not subject to a coach's challenge,\" Zarba said. \"The three things that teams can challenge are fouls, goaltends and out of bounds.\"\n\nWhile it was a game- and potentially series-altering mistake by the officials, Indiana still had an opportunity to win. It trimmed the deficit to one with a Pascal Siakam basket and then forced a turnover.\n\nHowever, Myles Turner was called for an offensive foul while setting a screen with 12 seconds remaining. The next time the Pacers got the ball, they were facing a four-point deficit thanks to three free throws from Jalen Brunson.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating,\" Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle told reporters after the loss. \"We're not expecting to get calls in here. It'd be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. So, that's just the way it goes.\"\n\nAt least Indiana was allowed to challenge the Turner foul, although the effort was deemed unsuccessful.\n\nThe Pacers could look at this with a glass-half-full approach and recognize they were a questionable call or two away from stealing a game on the road even when Brunson went off for 43 points, six rebounds and six assists.\n\nPerhaps Brunson will be slightly less effective in future games. Or perhaps the officiating won't be as big of a storyline.\n\nIndiana didn't look outmatched and can still make this a competitive series, but it will surely be thinking about some of the calls until it can take the floor again in Wednesday's Game 2.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715051879/dwe7frq2yfqwm1iuosvh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

They won Game 2 of their first-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers because the officials incorrectly chose not to call a foul on Josh Hart as he stole the ball from Tyrese Maxey during a critical game-saving possession. That injustice was balanced in Game 5, when the Knicks lost in large part because Maxey was not called for a travel that the league later determined he committed as he made a game-changing 3-pointer.\n\nBut so far in New York's second-round series against the Indiana Pacers, just about every controversial call has been in favor of the Knicks. Game 1 was littered with them. There was a kicked ball violation that saved a Knicks possession even though the ball was shown not to have been kicked upon replay. As kicked balls are not reviewable, there was nothing the officials could do to rectify that mistake. Then, with 12.7 seconds remaining, the Pacers had a chance to win with the ball down one. However, Myles Turner was called for an illegal screen that cost Indiana that chance. Review showed that it was indeed an illegal screen, but those calls are rarely made at the end of close playoff games.\n\nThis time, however, the whistle did not swing in Indiana's direction. The Pacers were similarly incensed by the officiating in Game 2. In fact, head coach Rick Carlisle even got ejected for complaining with 33.2 seconds remaining. After the loss, which gave the Knicks a 2-0 series lead, Carlisle unloaded on the officiating and implied the referees have a bias against a small-market team like Indiana.\n\nTo begin, though, Carlisle claimed that the officials missed 29 calls in Game 1.\n\n\"We always go through the film in games where it felt like the whistles weren't balanced, and we pull the clips, and there's a way you can submit them to the NBA office,\" Carlisle explained. \"In the playoffs when you submit things, the other team sees what you submit. And so, there were 29 plays in Game 1 that we thought were clearly called the wrong way. I decided not to submit them because I just felt like, you know, we'd get a more balanced whistle tonight. It didn't feel that way.\"\n\nSuch reports are a somewhat common part of the postseason. The 76ers, for instance, submitted one after Game 2 of their series against the Knicks. Whether they actually affect officiating in future games is hard to gauge, but Carlisle came into his postgame press conference on Wednesday with examples of what he believed were missed calls.\n\n\"A couple of examples. With 5:08 in the third, the whole world knows that [Tyrese] Haliburton's got a bad back. And Hart comes up and shoves him in the back. It's all over Twitter right now because a few people have showed it to me. JB DeRosa is looking right at it, you can see, he's got vision of the play and he shoves Tyrese into the corner, and there's no whistle. Right in the back. That was shocking, and there were many others. I can promise you that we're gonna submit these tonight. New York can get ready, they'll see them too,\" Carlisle said.\n\nHere is the play in question:\n\nHart does not get whistled for a foul on the play. In the fourth quarter, there was another moment that Carlisle cited in his press conference. With 1:19 remaining, Isaiah Hartenstein got called for a double dribble as he attempted to bring the ball up court. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau expressed frustration at the call, and the officials eventually determined that it was an inadvertent whistle. The Knicks were allowed to retain possession.\n\n\"One guy just said he didn't double-dribble. But it looked to me like, you know, Thibs went out and argued it and they changed it. That's what it looked like. I can only go by what I see, what I saw, and, you know, that's small beans compared to everything else. Small-market teams deserve an equal shot. They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing,\" Carlisle said in his most scathing quote of the night.\n\nFor the series, the Knicks have attempted 12 more free throws than the Pacers. During the regular season, the Knicks averaged 1.3 more free-throw attempts per game than the Pacers did. However, the Pacers committed 3.8 more total fouls per game than the Knicks did. All in all, you'd expect a free-throw advantage for New York in this series, though perhaps not as stark as it has been.\n\nThe totality of the calls are one thing. The specific, controversial moments are another. Both Game 1 and Game 2 have included several questionable calls in critical moments. Whether or not those calls ultimately determined the outcome is subjective, but Carlisle is doing everything in his power to prevent officiating decisions from defining the rest of the series.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/32e955dd-739c-4ac2-b3c0-de253fc2e857/thumbnail/1200x675/d5b70cabc4a449f867754505d85d0d7a/rick-carlisle-getty-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Plus, what does Nikola Jokic's third MVP mean?", "body": "It's weird we only had one game last night, but that'll be the best we can do pretty soon!\n\nKnicks go superNOVA in Game 2 win\n\nNew York reuniting as many Villanova teammates as possible has made life very easy for the Knicks and their fans. In Game 2 against the Pacers, New York got 76 combined points from Jalen Brunson, Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart in its 130-121 home win. Hart had a good first half (10 points, eight rebounds, three assists and a steal) before fellow former Wildcats DiVincenzo (20 points, four 3s) and Brunson (24 points, four assists) added big second-half performances to give the Knicks a 2-0 semifinals lead. This trio - along with OG Anunoby's 28 points in 28 minutes before he left with a hamstring injury - has created ginormous matchup and effort issues for Indy.\n\nWhile Pacers coach Rick Carlisle believes his only recourse is blaming officiating and filing Daryl Morey-esque grievances, Indiana's true problem is staying even with the Villanova guys, let alone getting ahead. The same goes for Anunoby and Isaiah Hartenstein, who have been respectively spectacular. Second-half defense and late-game execution have been brutal problems for the Pacers. Brunson has scored 35 points in this series ... in the fourth quarters alone! He had 21 points in the final period of Game 1 and added 14 to cap Game 2 - on a bum foot, to boot.\n\nWe'll see how the Pacers, upon returning home, respond in Game 3 on Friday.\n\n1) Will Anunoby (hamstring) and Brunson (foot) be healthy? Brunson left for a big chunk of the first half but thankfully returned for a great second half and finished the game. But that foot will be sore, so we'll have to see its effects on him. Anunoby leaving Game 2 without returning is definitely concerning. He was so good in the first half (22 points one shy of career high for any half) and makes life hard for the Pacers. The Knicks will need both guys in Indy.\n\n2) Is it time for the Pacers to start T.J. McConnell? It's pretty clear McConnell gives them a boost, is one of the few Pacers who plays good defense and has a major impact on the game. He's scoring and passing, which helped him be pretty good in the first two games. It's clear Andrew Nembhard has zero chance of defending Brunson. Sure, maybe McConnell won't impact the course of a full game. I understand they like him off the bench better, but something needs to change.\n\n3) Can Haliburton use this game to ignite his play? Tyrese Haliburton finished with 34 points, nine assists, six rebounds, three steals and just two turnovers. After shooting only six times in Game 1, he went 11 of 19 overall and 7 of 11 from deep in Game 2. Haliburton had 10 in the fourth quarter, as well. This has to be his standard for every game the rest of the series. Otherwise, they're done.\n\nOverreaction Prediction Recalibration: I'm worried about the Knicks' injuries, so I'll push this back to Knicks in six.\n\nA police spokesperson told Mike Vorkunov and me that detectives are working with Gainbridge Fieldhouse to review video footage and plan to speak with those involved. The result of the investigation will be presented to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office, which will decide whether to bring charges. The NBA also has been looking into the matter.\n\nElsewhere, Thanasis Antetokounmpo tore his Achilles during a workout this week, league sources say. The NBA veteran, who has spent the past five years playing with his brother Giannis on the Bucks, will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason. The injury and subsequent surgery will keep the 31-year-old Thanasis from competing for a spot on Greece's national team for the Paris Olympics.\n\nThird good and bad(?) historically\n\nFor the third time in four years, Nikola Joki\u0107 is the overwhelming pick for the Most Valuable Player award. Every time he's won it, there's been a massive distance between his first-place votes and the field's. In 2021, Joki\u0107 received 91 first-place votes. In 2022, he received 65 first-place votes compared to Joel Embiid's 26 first-place nods. This year, he received 79 of them, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander coming in second in overall voting points and first-place votes (15).\n\nJoki\u0107 has reached some rarified air, becoming the ninth player in NBA history to win at least three MVP awards. Moses Malone, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird also have three. Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James took home four. Michael Jordan and Bill Russell each totaled five as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six eclipses everyone else. Though Joki\u0107 joins Russell, Chamberlain, Kareem, Bird, Magic and LeBron to win three MVPs within a four-year window, he's also potentially in some less fortunate company with this MVP.\n\nIt's no secret the Nuggets are surprisingly down 0-2 to the Timberwolves, as Minnesota dominated them in Denver. Since the NBA/ABA Merger in 1976, 14 of the league's 47 MVPs failed to reach the conference finals. The last four MVP winners (including both of Joki\u0107's prior wins) didn't advance past the second round. So, as John Hollinger rightfully wonders when we put Joki\u0107 into the GOAT conversation (we've wondered the same thing), he and the Nuggets must figure out how to get back in their semifinals series within the next two games in Minneapolis.\n\nAdmittedly, I got a little worried today when I read Andrew Marchand's article about the future of TNT as a broadcast partner with the NBA. As the league renegotiates with broadcasting partners, there is a potential bluff to be called with Warner Bros. Discovery. Months ago, Discovery CEO David Zaslav said \"TNT doesn't need the NBA.\" Now, though, as it looks like the NBA will add Amazon Prime as a partner, and the final portion could go to TNT or NBC, if not both, we have a potential future in which TNT isn't broadcasting NBA games anymore.\n\nNormally, I wouldn't care which platform airs games. I watch hoops no matter where games are to be found. League Pass is fired up every night in the regular season, and nationally televised games are routinely consumed. But what about \"Inside the NBA\" going away if TNT doesn't have league rights? It's reported that Charles Barkley can leave for another platform if TNT loses rights, but \"Inside the NBA\" has been a staple of NBA coverage for decades. It is the best basketball show on TV, and it's not even close. The quartet of Chuck, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal is essential to any basketball week. I want to dive into this a little bit in the next week of newsletters, so I have a request for you, the Bounce reader. \ud83e\udef5\n\nWe want to hear from you! We've made a trusty little Google Form with seven questions about \"Inside the NBA,\" its future, its importance and much more.

Knicks, like the Celtics then, have a whole bunch of gritty role players around their little lefty who play with a chip on their shoulder and think they can beat anyone. They probably have a ceiling, but mannnnn have they been all sorts of fun so far. And they're somehow doing it while falling apart physically.\"\n\nIf King's comparison fully manifests, the Knicks are due for a swift elimination in the Eastern Conference Finals. Thomas didn't make it to Game 3, 4, or 5, injuring his hip after Game 2. Brunson is still healthy, but the Knicks lost their version of Jae Crowder, OG Anunoby, with a hamstring issue and he may not return for the rest of the postseason.\n\nBleacher Report's Dan Favale believed the Celtics' biggest threat was the Knicks because of Anunoby. Without OG, one has to wonder if NY has the talent to contain Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown over a seven-game series.\n\nWith the Knicks hobbling into the Eastern Conference Finals, if they can even get past the Pacers two more times, and the Denver Nuggets seemingly struggling to make it to the Western Conference Finals, it appears as though the previously held narratives about the Celtics' path to Banner 18 are obsolete.\n\nDon't sleep on the OKC Thunder or Minnesota Timberwolves.

Donte DiVincenzo wiggled free for a vital three-point shot to give the Knicks a late lead, and Tyrese Haliburton had a crushing turnover on Indiana's final possession. Andrew Nembhard missed a shot and committed an away-from-the-play foul in the final minute or so. The blue and gold had a chance to win Game 1 -- the score was tied with 41 seconds remaining -- but came up short.\n\nYet many of the questions fielded by Pacers players after the game were related to the officiating. In the final minute of action, Aaron Nesmith was called for a kicked ball violation on defense and Myles Turner was whistled for a moving screen, and there was another review less than a minute before that.\n\nTo the Pacers, some of those whistles felt incorrect. \"It wasn't a kicked ball. You can clearly see it,\" Nesmith said after the game.\n\nA kicked ball call is not reviewable, something the Pacers knew in real time during the game. They couldn't stop things and have that play looked at, and Crew Chief Zach Zarba explained after the game that a kicked ball violation can't be reviewed. The ball hit Nesmith's hand, but the call on the court is what mattered.\n\nThe Knicks retained possession, and DiVincenzo wiggled free for the aforementioned three-point shot. \"On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation. Post game review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal,\" Zarba said in his pool report. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said he wasn't given an explanation for that call.\n\nIndiana kept fighting. They scored and got a stop, meaning they had the ball down by one in the final 20 seconds of action. That's when Turner was whistled for an illegal screen. He was shifting his weight as DiVincenzo tried to get around him, and the officials deemed it an offensive foul.\n\nIt gave the Knicks possession, and they used it to balloon their lead to four and put the game away. \"In my experience in this league, I think it's best when players decide the outcome of a game,\" Turner said after the game, noting that DiVincenzo sold the contact well.\n\nThose two plays were noticeably frustrating to Pacers players during the game. Turner said during his press conference after the outing that he's looking forward to the Last Two Minutes report that will be released on Tuesday.\n\nWhile those two moments in particular led to emotional responses after the battle, the Pacers know that it's a 48 minute game. It isn't decided in two possessions. They need to play better, especially defensively and on the glass, if they are going to bounce back in this series.\n\n\"You can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. We have to take accountability as well,\" Turner said. He finished with 23 points in the loss, a team-high number. \"You can't rely on the refs, especially in this building,\"\n\nEssentially everyone else agreed. \"We can't worry about the officiating. They're just trying to do their job,\" point guard T.J. McConnell said. \"There are many plays that we could have made where it didn't even come down to that. That's the stuff we've got to focus on.\" McConnell had his second-straight terrific playoff game, finishing with 18 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating. We're not expecting to get calls in here. It'd be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. That's just the way it goes,\" Carlisle said, specifically referring to the moving screen call on Turner. That call was challenged and upheld.\n\nIndiana lost the first game of their first-round series as well, and they bounced back in Game 2 with a key road victory. That is their only win away from Indianapolis throughout the playoffs so far, and it proved to be vital. The Pacers have done well all season to recover from low points, and they'll look to do it again on Wednesday night.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_east@si.com", "name": "Tony East", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

With the Knicks leading the series 1-0, the Pacers look to bounce back and even the series.\n\nIn Game 1, the Knicks' collective effort led them to a 121-117 victory over the Pacers. Jalen Brunson's 43 points were instrumental, making him the fourth player in NBA history to score 40 or more points in four consecutive playoff games. Josh Hart also played a crucial role, contributing to New York's success with a career-high of 24 points, 13 rebounds, and eight assists.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers will play against the New York Knicks on Wednesday, May 8 at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nUpdated NBA playoff bracket: Results, schedule, and full NBA postseason picture\n\nSteve Aschburner writes: \"New York is more likely to set the pace for this series, which will thwart Indiana's biggest strength, that faster preferred style. Brunson has been irrepressible, averaging 31 points since the All-Star break with a usage rating (35.5) that would match Luka Doncic's season-long mark. Role players Anunoby, Hartenstein, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo are gritty complements. And while we don't want to put too much weight on the In-Season Tournament, the Pacers did shrink with the NBA Cup on the line in Las Vegas. This stage is even bigger.\"\n\nKurt Helin writes: \"If Haliburton can find his pre-injury form -- even just for a couple of games -- then this quickly becomes a six or seven-game series. Peak Indiana and peak Haliburton can play with New York, but he hasn't consistently been the same since his hamstring injury. New York is playing too well right now, and this is just not a great matchup for the Pacers.\"\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

I'll be fine.\"\n\nHaliburton started experiencing lower back spasms before Game 4 of the Pacers' opening-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks. He was listed as questionable for the final three games of that series, which the Pacers won in six, but played at least 32 minutes and scored at least 16 points in each.\n\nPrimarily guarded in Monday's loss by the Knicks' Donte DiVincenzo, Haliburton vowed Tuesday to be more aggressive in Wednesday night's Game 2 at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"They're a good defensive team, but honestly, I look at it more as a Tyrese issue than a Knicks issue,\" Haliburton said of his low scoring output. \"I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nHaliburton, a two-time All-Star, averaged 20.1 points and 10.9 assists per game in the regular season, though his numbers dipped after he returned from a hamstring strain in January.\n\nThrough seven playoff games, Haliburton is averaging 14.6 points and 9.1 rebounds. His eight assists on Monday led the Pacers, though he was the only starter on either team who didn't score in double-figures.\n\n\"I've got to do a better job of getting him more shots,\" Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said Tuesday. \"I'll give you that. Look, he's playing through some stuff. He'll be on the injury report as questionable [for Game 2] with the back thing. I'm confident he'll play, but he's playing through some stuff there, too. This is the second round of the playoffs, and this is hard. You've got to embrace the difficulty of the whole thing.\"\n\nHaliburton attempted only one shot and scored only two points in the second half of Monday's loss. Five Pacers took more shots than Haliburton, while two others matched his six.\n\n\"He's the engine of the team,\" Indiana forward Pascal Siakim said. \"He gets everyone in their spots. Things that make him great are not just scoring. He can do a lot of other things, and when he is at his pace and playing fast, he doesn't have to be scoring. He leads our team in that way, and he's been doing that all year.\"\n\nMagnifying Haliburton's lack of scoring was that the Knicks' star point guard, Jalen Brunson, exploded for 43 points -- his fourth consecutive playoff game with at least 40.\n\nCarlisle declined to consider whether Haliburton would be playing through the back issue if this were the regular season.\n\n\"This time of year, everybody's got something going,\" Carlisle said. \"He's working at it, doing everything he can to keep himself feeling as good as possible. It's a factor, but he'll play. I'm confident he'll play, but it's a concern.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@nydailynews.com", "name": "Peter Sblendorio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysart_et_al,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dysart et al, Ontario"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24128027796287_e73ffe.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Daryl Morey's front office officially filed a grievance (but not a protest) with the league office. And now they're not alone.\n\nAs Joel Embiid put it, when his teammate Tyrese Maxey was fouled more than once on the pivotal play of Game 2 of round one: \"That's fucking unacceptable, to lose a game like that, especially in the playoffs.\"\n\nAnd now, according to one of ESPN's top NBA Insider's, Brian Windhorst, the Indiana Pacers feel similarly disadvantaged after two games at \"The Mecca.\"\n\nSo now the NBA has -- I'm guessing a video link -- from two teams taking at least four (and counting?) heartbreaking L's at the Garden.\n\nWindy expounded on his official report via ESPN radio, Thursday a.m.:\n\n\"Game 1, I do think it would have been appropriate for the Pacers to flip out. They didn't. But let me tell ya how they flipped out after Game 2. So you heard [Wednesday night] that [Pacers head coach] Ric Carlisle said that they found 29 calls from Game 1 that they thought went against them that shouldn't have. And they put that together and edited and then they were gonna send that to the league and then didn't. Well, from what I understand, speaking to people this morning, the Pacers were up all night, and they found 49, [pauses for emphasis] 49 calls from last night's game that they felt were inappropriately against them....\n\nSo overnight the Pacers filed the 49 clips [from Game 2] and for good measure the 29 from Game 1. So when people get into work at the league office today they're gonna find 78 clips having been submitted from the Pacers to the league office about how they feel this series is being officiated.\"\n\nDuring Game 1 of Pacers-Knicks, after a pivotal blown call advantaging New York, Joel Embiid fired off an \"LOL\" tweet. It was characteristically vague, and if asked he'd probably trollingly joke he was just watching Peppa Pig with his son, but fans didn't have much trouble decoding Troel's intent based on the timing.\n\nThe subsequent official Last Two Minute report confirmed that the Pacers should have had a couple of live-ball turnovers to work with in transition late. Instead, one was a sideline out, and the other led to a Donte DiVincenzo triple.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nEven Knicks' diehard Stephen A. Smith and LeBron James didn't understand the officiating in Game 2 of Sixers-Knicks, after a blown call leading to a DDV triple.\n\nWhile many Sixers fans are still not over that Game 2 loss seeing Indiana go through the same process might provide a bit of solace. And for other Philly fans who don't find solace, there might appear to be a maddening pattern in New York.\n\nI find myself in both of those buckets: solace we're not alone, maddened by an apparent pattern. We weren't totally insane (sighs deeply). What's going on over at MSG? (Shakes fist towards The Mecca).\n\nSixers fans and Pacers fans should all be able to agree that their favorite Tyrese isn't getting all of the same marginal contact calls that Brunson is getting.\n\nLike the Sixers, the Pacers probably will most likely not benefit from their official complaint.\n\nThey're still down 2-0. More likely, they'll benefit from a couple key injuries the Knicks sustained (Jalen Brunson tweaked his foot before returning and OG Anunoby appears set to miss time with hamstring soreness).\n\nAnd like the Sixers, Indy may wind up seeing some of the exact same NBA officials they were frustrated by, later in this very series.\n\nBut are there any bigger implications here?\n\nThe Willis Reed-esque legend of Jalen Brunson continues to grow, as the Knicks, squarely in the NBA's biggest market, set their sights on a Conference Finals run that has so far eluded Joel Embiid and co.\n\nYou'll remember a similarly reported theme one year ago, with a chance to make a Conference Finals on the line:\n\nBrunson, who just finished fifth in MVP voting this year (deservedly so) is quickly becoming larger than life around the Big Apple, the way Patrick Ewing once was. Embiid is once again being discussed on the networks as a guy who just can't stay healthy enough to get over the hump. Tyrese Maxey's stellar season, flu-game-shoulda-been heroics, and Maxey Miracle at MSG are becoming footnotes outside of Philly. Stop whining, go fishing.\n\nWhen maybe a few key calls going the other way could flip the narratives being written considerably.\n\nAnd with Boston's superteam looming as the Knicks most likely ultimate fate, I cannot help but wonder if Knicks President Leon Rose might not be able to sell a key free agent or disgruntled star on his Mecca.\n\nWe're only one piece away, in the best, most basketball-obsessed city in the country. You're that missing piece!\n\nWould Daryl Morey or Pacers' Prez Kevin Pritchard prefer their offseason pitch to the likes of PG, Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, or even dare I say, Kevin Durant, if they'd made (or could make) an East Finals berth?\n\nWe're now only a month away from official slop season where the Sixers may well be competing with the Knicks once again. Not for their playoff lives, but for offseason acquisitions.\n\nBut for now, we'll see if the league pays a bit more attention to a massive, growing collection of calls, now that a second team is getting in on the action.", "source": {"uri": "libertyballers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Ballers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_early@libertyballers.com", "name": "David Early", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Windhorst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Windhorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Carlisle received two technical fouls between the call and the end of the game.\n\nThe problem is, the refs ultimately made the right call, as Hartenstein didn't double-dribble.\n\nAfter the game, Carlisle went off on the officiating. While he claimed that the double-dribble controversy wasn't that big of a deal in his mind, he simply thinks that the Pacers aren't getting calls because they're a small-market team.\n\nTo his defense, the Pacers did get absolutely jobbed at the end of Monday's game 1 on a costly incorrect kick ball call that led to the Knicks' go-ahead three-pointer in the final minute.\n\nThat's a bad call, and he has every right to be mad about it. But, Wednesday's game two seemed to be officiated pretty evenly. Foul shots were even until the Pacers were forced to foul in the game's final minute.\n\nAnd, the small market thing really doesn't hold much weight when you look at the evidence. If the league was interested in helping big-market teams win, the New York Knicks the 2nd-most valuable franchise in the sport in the league's biggest market, would've been a lot more successful over the past 25 years. Instead, half of the NBA titles won since 2023 have been won by teams in San Antonio, Oakland, and Miami. Those aren't exactly the league's marquee markets.\n\nUltimately, it seems like sour grapes. The Pacers are facing a Knicks team that's without Julius Randle, Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107, and Mitchell Robinson. They're likely to be without OG Anunoby too, who looked like he pulled his hamstring in the second half of game two.\n\nAt this point, if the Pacers can't beat a severely depleted Knicks team that has starters playing all 48 minutes in some cases, that says more about the Pacers than it does the referees.\n\nThe series goes to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_carr@brobible.com", "name": "Garrett Carr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogdan_Bogdanovi\u0107_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107 (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-215212011611.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

And narrow margins bring increased scrutiny on the officiating.\n\nControversial endings in Game 1 vs. the Pacers and Game 2 vs. the 76ers went in favor of the Knicks. But the 76ers picked up an advantage in on a missed call in Game 5 of the first-round series.\n\nReferees created another controversy during Game 2 of the Knicks-Pacers series, albeit not on a make-or-break call.\n\nNew York's Isaiah Hartenstein was called for a double dribble in the backcourt as the Knicks led 124-118 with just over a minute to play. Immediately following the whistle, though, the officiating crew discussed the play and overturned it without replay review.\n\nPacers head coach Rick Carlisle took issue with the series of events, which helped lead to his ejection in the final minute.\n\nKnicks injury updates: Jalen Brunson | OG Anunoby | Mitchell Robinson\n\nOfficiating crews can -- and often do -- discuss calls with each other to get different perspectives on the same play. That seemed to be the case in Madison Square Garden for the supposed double dribble.\n\nThe referees changed the call without replay review because referees aren't allowed to check the monitor for violations, which includes double dribbles. And neither coach could trigger a review as less than two minutes remained in the game.\n\nThe referees overturned the original call, dubbing it an inadvertent whistle. The Knicks received an inbounds play with 19 seconds remaining the shot clock.\n\nAlthough the overturned call ruffled feathers and helped lead to Rick Carlisle's ejection, it seemed to be the correct one based on video of the play. The NBA's Last Two Minute Report will offer a final verdict.\n\nCarlisle was furious with the overturned call. If the double dribble call stood, the Pacers would have had the opportunity to cut the Knicks' lead to three or four points with more than a minute remaining.\n\nThe 64-year-old coach let his temper flare too much in the final minute. He picked up two technical fouls on separate occasions. Brunson was awarded free throws each time, giving him the chance to increase the Knicks lead.\n\nAfter Indiana's loss, Carlisle questioned the officiating in Game 2, saying his \"small-market\" team deserved \"a fair shot.\" He also felt there were \"29 plays in Game 1 that we thought were clearly called the wrong way.\"\n\nCarlisle plans to file complaints about the calls to the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dribble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double dribble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_replay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instant replay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Turner got called for an offensive foul instantly, which prompted the Pacers to challenge the call.\n\nThe Pacers were unsuccessful with the challenge, and the league's report stood by that ruling Tuesday.\n\nStill, there were a total of four missed calls in the final two minutes, according to the league's report: Turner should have been whistled for a separate illegal screen on DiVincenzo in the backcourt with about 10 seconds remaining; there was an errant kicked ball violation called on Aaron Nesmith with 53 seconds left; and prior to those, officials missed calling a defensive three seconds violation on Turner with 1:19 left.\n\nAfter the Game 1 defeat, Turner said, \"In my experience in this league, I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game,\" while adding that he looked forward to the release of the Last Two Minute Report.\n\nFollowing the call on Turner, the Knicks sank three free throws to put the game away.

Brunson actually left this game in the first half with a sore foot and was forced to miss the entirety of the second quarter; however, the former Villanova Wildcat would eventually return for the second half and make several crucial plays down the stretch to give the Knicks an impressive 4-1 record at home so far in these playoffs.\n\nImmediately after the game, TNT's coverage switched over from their broadcast crew in the arena to the Inside the NBA crew back in Atlanta, and right away, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal began taking shots at the Knicks and the city of New York as a whole, for no apparent reason.\n\n\"I would love to see them get their a** stomped, that'd be great,\" said Barkley, via Awful Announcing on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter. \"...The New Yorkers, y'all deserve it. Y'all think y'all the greatest thing since sliced bread.\"\n\nOne person who wasn't thrilled with the bizarre disrespect was occasional Knicks fan and sports media personality Stephen A. Smith, who took to ESPN's First Take to give his response.\n\n\"Chuck needs to shut the hell up,\" said Smith. \"...the only time his behind shows up in New York City is when he was doing the show with Gayle King for CNN or when he's doing the NCAA Tournament. Other than that, he ain't interested in New York City. And by the way, if you paid attention, we're actually the opposite. We know we're not all that. That's part of our problem... we're not delusional.

Smith might not be the best spokesman for the Knicks fanbase considering he has proven himself to be not all that familiar with the roster itself, it remains true that Barkley's comments were bizarre, to say the least.\n\nHow far can the Knicks go?\n\nThe Knicks are now within two games of clinching their first Eastern Conference Finals birth in over two decades, and if they do so, they will more than likely match up with the Boston Celtics, who have been the NBA's best team over the entirety of the season.\n\nIf New York is able to complete a sweep of the Pacers this weekend in Games 3 and 4, then Knicks fans won't have to hear another word from Barkley's mouth this season, as both Friday's game and Sunday's game are on ESPN networks, and the conference finals this year are set to take place exclusively on ESPN.\n\nIn any case, Friday evening's game is slated to take place at 7:00 PM ET from the Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indiana on ESPN.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Not this, these.\n\nThat's because Josh Hart played 48 minutes for the second game in a row and the second time in three days.\n\n\"My Lord works in mysterious ways,\" is the only explanation Hart could find for his body holding up through 96 grueling minutes of playoff basketball.\n\n\"I had a decision to make and I made a decision,\" Brunson said after coming back in time to get a bunch of reps through halftime warmups before slashing the Pacers for the second time this week.\n\nEven Thibs went left when everybody was thinking right and played Alec Burks on this unforgettable evening.\n\nOf course, this being the New York Knicks, you knew something bad had to happen, didn't you?\n\nEnter OG's hammy getting funny.\n\nOf course, this being the New York Knicks, you knew it had to happen while OG was having the absolute best postseason game he's ever played -- yes, I said it, that's including both Knicks and Raptors threads.\n\nOgugua was on the court for a bit under 28 minutes but he still found a way to dump 28 points on the day. To go with 4 boards, 3 dimes, 1 block, and no turnovers at all. Plus/minus? +10, what did you expect?\n\nWhat you could expect, however, is OG hitting the shelves for at least one, two, or a few more games. Hammies are no joke, and it's better to rest them nicely instead of putting them under stress and daring them to fire back at you.\n\nBut hey, this being the Knicks...\n\nAs ridiculous as it sounds and looks, the Knicks are one of only two teams across the whole freaking League with 6 playoff wins entering Friday (games played be damned).\n\nThe Knicks are closer to making the conference finals than the reigning NBA champions. They are closer than the No. 1 team in the East, one they will presumptively and eventually meet. They are closer than the No. 1 seed in the West, and tied with a bunch of wolves led by the second coming of Michael Jordan (no, seriously).\n\nVibes, immaculate, even though y'all Basketball Gods up there making it hella tough for this bunch of resilient mofos to keep pushing forward and trouncing hapless hopefuls.", "source": {"uri": "postingandtoasting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Posting and Toasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "antonio_losada@postingandtoasting.com", "name": "Antonio Losada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ice hockey at the Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FpXK0vY-6PGxMwiAG82u5QX72cc=/0x0:4245x2123/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25439893/2152120681.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe New York Knicks escaped with a Game 1 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night, 121-117, and it came with some controversy over a questionable call late in the game.\n\nWith about 12 seconds left in the game and Indiana down one point, Tyrese Haliburton was about to make a move on Donte DiVincenzo as Myles Turner set a screen. However, DiVincenzo fell down as he ran into the Turner screen and sold it as though he had been hit hard.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe referees called a foul on Turner, and the ball went back to the Knicks.\n\n\"Just in my experience in this league I think it's best when you let the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said after the game. \"\"I think it's unfortunate that it happened ... called it an illegal screen. It's the playoffs. I think DiVincenzo did a good job selling it. For the most part, you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. We have to take accountability as well. We know at the end of the day we can't get to that position.\"\n\nIndiana challenged the play, but the call was upheld. The call drew plenty of reaction.\n\n\"That is shocking,\" Stan Van Gundy said on the broadcast. \"You never see that call at this point in the game. I mean, never. ... That is a great acting job. Lot of great actors here in New York City; you see 'em on Broadway all the time. That's as good an acting job as you'll see.\"\n\nVIEW THE MOMENT ON X\n\n\"Entourage\" star Jerry Ferrara wrote on X, \"The NBA wants the Knicks to win. My favorite take. Well if that's true then it's about time. Tough call in that situation but if you think that decided the game go watch something else.\"\n\nHEAT'S PAT RILEY HAS STERN MESSAGE FOR JIMMY BUTLER AFTER KNICKS SWIPE: 'YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT'\n\n\"LOL,\" Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid added.\n\nESPN's Don Van Natta Jr. wrote, \"I've been a Knicks fan since 1973 and the referees just fleeced the Pacers at MSG. Ruined a fantastic series opener.\"\n\nThe referees did admit they incorrectly called a late kicked ball violation against the Packers, who by rule could not challenge the play. It happened with 52 seconds left. Aaron Nesmith appeared to knock the ball from Jalen Brunson, but it was determined Nesmith kicked it.\n\nTwelve seconds later, DiVincenzo hit another clutch 3-pointer.\n\nBrunson scored 43 points in the win and became the fourth player to score at least 40 points in four consecutive postseason games since Michael Jordan in the 1993 NBA Finals.\n\n\"The little things can go a long way,\" Brunson said. \"So yeah, the 40 points are cool and all, but it's the little things that help us win games like that.

In the mind of New York's starting point guard, as 22.1 seconds remained during the Knicks' opening-game win of the second round against the Pacers, Brunson had dribbled quite obviously off Andrew Nembhard's left sneaker. So when the officials agreed with Indiana's bench, all pointing in the direction of the Pacers' possession, Brunson did what any player in his position is now wont to do: He twirled his finger, imploring New York's coaches to challenge the call.\n\nThe Knicks had already won a challenge earlier in the contest, midway through the third quarter, when Brunson was dinged for whacking Pacers center Myles Turner under the basket. Seated in the second row of New York's bench, player development assistant Scott King consulted with the iPad in his lap. The tape looked unequivocal. Brunson had picked Turner clean. And with a nod from King, head coach Tom Thibodeau clapped his hands in the shape of a \"T,\" calling timeout and demanding the referees to review the matter. New York won that first challenge. The foul was overturned, and the Knicks received possession since OG Anunoby immediately corralled the ball following Brunson's block. The Knicks were then awarded their second challenge, which New York later used to overturn the late call off Nembhard's foot.\n\nAnother pair of successful challenges only added to the Knicks' striking edge so far this postseason when it comes to twirling their index fingers in search of greater justice. The Knicks' two effective reviews in Game 1 versus Indiana came after New York already led the league in total challenges (8) and successful challenges (6) during the first round of the NBA playoffs. For their troubles, the Knicks saved an estimated 7.88 points over six games against Philadelphia. That might seem like a small number over so many matchups. Yet considering the Knicks outlasted the Sixers by a grand total of one point over the course of the series, 650-649, those challenges may have provided an added margin for New York to claw out of that dogfight against Philadelphia. Any small tilt in one direction can swing the playoffs' unforgiving scale.\n\nThe Knicks have been more aggressive utilizing challenges early in games dating back to the midway point of the regular season, this being the first full campaign that NBA teams have been awarded an additional challenge, if their first is proven correct. \"In certain situations, we feel there's an advantage to knowing that you're 100% certain, that you're still gonna have one,\" Thibodeau said. King, according to Thibodeau, has been researching challenge trends across the league. \"And we've actually been very successful with it.\"\n\nNew York's not alone. According to officiating data obtained by Yahoo Sports, only 9.8% of regular-season challenges across the NBA came in the first quarter of games, whereas 17.2% of challenges during the first round of the playoffs came during the opening 12 minutes of games. For the entire first half, challenges are up a full 10% in the postseason compared to the regular season. The Knicks, for example, would look for opportunities on fouls Joel Embiid drew, even if Philadelphia was to retain possession, just to combat the Sixers center's guile for getting to the line and prevent Embiid from finding a rhythm during those freebies. If an opponent gets to keep the ball after a challenge reverses a foul in the challenging team's favor, offenses are often left with minimal time on the shot clock, which can likely lead to a rushed shot and a defensive stop. Teams are trying to eliminate emotion driving the decision to object a particular out of bounds, foul or goaltend.\n\nOklahoma City has led the charge in signaling for reviews early and often. The Thunder paced the NBA in total challenges (64) during the regular season as well as successful challenges (41), giving OKC a 64.1% success rate. In a four-game sweep of New Orleans in the first round, the Thunder ranked 14th, tied for last, with just two total challenges, but tied for first with 100% accuracy.\n\n\"We're looking for high-leverage situations where we can try and shave points off. Two points in the first quarter is equal to us as two points in the fourth quarter,\" Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault said. \"And so it's all about the likelihood of winning the challenge, and then the impact of the play itself. That's the calculus that we're trying to get done.\"\n\nOKC's streak of postseason challenge success did come to an end Tuesday. Daigneault protested a call with 4:51 to play in the second quarter of Game 1 against Dallas, as the Thunder were whistled for tripping Kyrie Irving. A correct challenge would have saved defensive stalwart Luguentz Dort from drawing his third foul of the opening half, but Oklahoma City lost the call and an additional opportunity to overturn a whistle.\n\n\"Thought maybe an illegal screen and a combination of the third foul -- it was really the third foul,\" Daigneault said. \"If it wasn't the third foul, we probably wouldn't have done it. But I thought the value of trying to swing it around was worth it at that point, but you're not gonna hit 1.000.\"\n\nThat is the razor's edge of this battle in the trenches, taking place on video tablets behind NBA team benches. Where possessions are a decreasing commodity, and one crucial call, like the Pacers felt with Myles Turner's crunchtime moving screen, could leave the door open wide enough for an opponent to sneak through -- and win.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Daigneault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Daigneault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luguentz_Dort", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luguentz Dort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_shaving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point shaving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shot clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/Laser_Challenge", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/Laser Challenge", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6vVimScsHrZ6ntHTnShamw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/28038163c947f64a9589286d334bf759", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The Knicks won 130-121.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said Wednesday that \"small-market teams deserve an equal shot\" during a complaint about the officiating in his team's loss to the New York Knicks.\n\nCarlisle was called for two technical fouls and ejected late as his Pacers fell 130-121, putting them in a 2-0 hole in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nHe said the Pacers found 29 calls they felt were incorrect in their Game 1 loss, but he didn't submit them to the NBA. He vowed he would be sending them this time.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials and, but, we deserve a fair shot,\" Carlisle said.\n\n\"There's not a consistent balance. It's disappointing.\"\n\nOfficials acknowledged an incorrectly called kicked ball violation late in Game 1, but the Pacers believed there were plenty other instances of wrong whistles.\n\n\"In the playoffs, when you submit things, the other team can see what you submit. And so, there were 29 plays in Game 1 that we thought were clearly called the wrong way. I decided not to submit them because I just felt like we'd get a more balanced whistle tonight,\" Carlisle said. \"It didn't feel that way.\"\n\nHe cited a play in the third quarter where he felt the Knicks' Josh Hart shoved All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton -- who has been battling back spasms -- in the back.\n\n\"It's all over Twitter right now because a few people have showed it to me and JB DeRosa is looking right at it,\" Carlisle said. \"You can see he has vision of the play and he shoves Tyrese into the corner and there is no whistle. Right in the back. That was shocking and there were many others. But I can promise you that we are going to submit these tonight. New York can get ready. They can see them, too.\"\n\nHaliburton said the Pacers needed to blame themselves, not the officials.\n\n\"At the end of the day we got outplayed. We were right there in the game,\" Haliburton said. \"But I like consistency, yeah. But let's not pretend, like, that's the only reason we lost. We just didn't play good enough. But at the end of the day it's 2-0.\"\n\nBut Carlisle, who felt Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau's yelling at the officials got a late double dribble violation against center Isaiah Hartenstein changed to an inadvertent whistle that allowed New York to keep the ball, wants things to change when the series moves to Indiana for Game 3 on Friday.\n\n\"Small-market teams deserve an equal shot,\" he said. \"They deserve a fair shot no matter where they are playing.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_mahoney@eagletribune.com", "name": "Brian Mahoney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/77/7777a810-9d3d-58b0-8b29-1429cbf29716/663c3f1b8d9b4.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Since arriving in New York, Brunson has quickly ascended to become a pivotal figure, mirroring the influence of some of the greatest point guards in Knicks history.\n\nThis article delves into the top ten point guards who have donned the Knicks uniform, analyzing their contributions and the indelible marks they have left on the franchise. From Walt Frazier's championship heroics to Jalen Brunson's current leadership in propelling the Knicks through the playoffs, we explore the stories of these players who have not only defined eras but have also shaped the legacy of one of the NBA's storied franchises.\n\nBest Playoff Results: 1970 NBA Finals (Won 4-3 against the Lakers), 1973 NBA Finals (Won 4-1 against the Lakers)\n\nWalt Frazier was instrumental in the New York Knicks' most successful era, highlighted by two NBA Championships in 1970 and 1973. Known for his remarkable skill set, Frazier averaged 18.9 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game during his Knicks career, showcasing his ability to influence the game in multiple facets. His defensive skills were also elite, with an average of 1.9 steals per game, illustrating his role as a top perimeter defender.\n\nFrazier's accolades include seven All-Star selections, reflecting his status as one of the premier point guards of his time. He was also named to the All-NBA First Team four times and earned seven selections to the NBA All-Defensive First Team, underscoring his prowess on both ends of the court. His playoff performances were particularly noteworthy; in the 1970 NBA Finals, his legendary Game 7 included a 36-point, 19-assist masterpiece that is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA Finals history.\n\nThroughout his career, Frazier was not just a stats leader but a critical clutch player whose performances in key games were vital to his team's success. His leadership and poise under pressure were integral to the Knicks' championship runs, solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest point guards in NBA history, and the greatest ever for the Knicks.\n\nBest Playoff Results: 1973 NBA Finals (Won 4-1 against the Lakers)\n\nEarl \"The Pearl\" Monroe is another legendary figure in the history of the New York Knicks, renowned for his flamboyant playing style and clutch scoring ability. Joining the Knicks in 1971, Monroe quickly became a key component of a team that was a perennial contender in the NBA during the early 70s. Over his nine seasons with the Knicks, Monroe averaged 16.2 points per game, using his unique, spinning moves and an array of shots to dazzle opponents and fans alike.\n\nMonroe's contributions were pivotal in helping the Knicks capture the NBA Championship in 1973, his performance throughout the playoffs epitomizing his ability to elevate his game when it mattered most. Alongside Walt Frazier, he formed one of the most formidable backcourts in NBA history, known for their defensive and offensive synergy.\n\nMonroe was selected to the NBA All-Star team four times during his career, illustrating his status among the elite guards of his era. His style of play not only contributed significantly on the court but also left a lasting impact on the culture of basketball, influencing generations of players with his creativity and flair.\n\nDespite facing stiff competition and often being overshadowed by other stars on the team, Monroe's knack for scoring in clutch situations and his smooth ball-handling skills made him a fan favorite and a crucial part of the Knicks' success during his tenure.\n\nBest Playoff Results: 1989 Eastern Conference Semifinals (lost 4-2 to the Bulls), 1990 Eastern Conference Semifinals (lost 4-1 to the Pistons)\n\nStats: 11.1 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 8.0 APG, 1.6 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nHonors with the Knicks: 1988 Rookie of the Year, 1x All-Star (1989)\n\nMark Jackson, known for his sharp court vision and superb passing skills, played a crucial role during his time with the New York Knicks. Originally drafted by the Knicks in 1987, Jackson made an immediate impact, earning NBA Rookie of the Year honors. Over his two stints with the team, he averaged 11.1 points and 8.0 assists per game, demonstrating his ability to control the game's pace and set up his teammates effectively.\n\nAlthough the Knicks did not reach the NBA Finals during Jackson's tenure, he was instrumental in leading the team to several playoff appearances. His playoff performances were marked by his clutch playmaking and ability to make big plays in crucial moments, notably during the 1989 and 1990 Eastern Conference Semifinals against tough opponents like the Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons.\n\nJackson was renowned for his basketball IQ, which allowed him to outsmart opponents and make plays that few other point guards could. His 8.0 assists per game average with the Knicks reflects his passing prowess, and his 1.6 steals per game demonstrate his defensive capabilities as well.\n\nJackson's leadership on the floor was a vital asset for the Knicks during his years with the team. His ability to run the offense and his unselfish style of play were key factors in the Knicks' successes during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though his time with the Knicks did not culminate in an NBA championship, Mark Jackson's impact on the team and his contribution to its competitive spirit during his tenure are fondly remembered by fans.\n\nBest Playoff Results: 2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals (lost 4-2 to the Heat), Currently Knicks lead 2-0 against Pacers in 2024 Eastern Conference Semifinals\n\nJalen Brunson has quickly established himself as a pivotal figure for the New York Knicks since joining the team in 2022.

His impressive performance earned him a spot in the 2024 NBA All-Star game, underscoring his status as the leader of the Knicks.\n\nBrunson's tenure with the Knicks has been characterized by his ability to carry the offensive load and his clutch performances, particularly in high-pressure situations. His leadership was evident during the 2023 NBA playoffs, where he led the Knicks to the Eastern Conference Semifinals, although they were ultimately defeated by the Miami Heat.

The Knicks made only one playoff appearance during his tenure, in 2004, where they were swept in the first round by the New Jersey Nets. This period was also characterized by frequent coaching changes and turmoil within the team, which often overshadowed his on-court contributions.\n\nMarbury's Knicks career highlighted his basketball talents but also the challenges of leading a team in a high-pressure market like New York.

His veteran leadership and high basketball IQ were crucial in stabilizing the Knicks' lineup, complementing their tough, defensive-oriented playing style.

He was celebrated for his ability to take over games with his scoring bursts and was particularly renowned for his crossover dribble, which became a signature move that baffled defenders and excited fans.\n\nCrawford's impact on the Knicks was significant in terms of offensive production. He had multiple high-scoring games, including a memorable 52-point performance where he demonstrated his incredible shooting range and scoring versatility.

While known more for his defense and game management, Rivers also provided important offensive contributions and clutch play during critical moments of games.\n\nBeyond the numbers, Rivers' impact was felt in his leadership and poise under pressure, which resonated with his teammates and helped forge a gritty, determined Knicks squad.

Sharpe stated that Brunson is playing unbelievably well.\n\nMolly Qerim: Who has been more impressive this postseason, Jalen Brunson or Ant-Man?\n\nShannon Sharpe: They've both been very, very impressive, but what Jalen Brunson is doing is unbelievable. To get the shots he is getting, scoring from the lane, when they absolutely have to have a bucket, he goes and gets it. That is not to say that Anthony Edwards has not been impressive. He has been extremely impressive, especially having the lead on the defending champ. What is Jalen Brunson doing game in and game out when they have to have it? Karl-Anthony Towns will get your 60 points in a ballgame, so they have another guy who can go get 50 points in the game. It's Jalen Brunson or bust.\n\nAlso Read: Jalen Brunson Enters NBA History Books With 41-Point Performance in Series-Clinching Win\n\nOn Monday, the New York Knicks pulled off a surprise victory over the Indiana Pacers, winning 121-117 in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series. Jalen Brunson was the show's star, scoring an impressive 43 points to lead his team to victory. He received support from Donte DiVincenzo, who scored 25 points, and Josh Hart, who scored 24 points.\n\nBrunson also contributed with six assists and six rebounds. Despite facing bigger and more physically imposing opponents, Brunson scored some amazing shots. This season, Brunson has averaged 28.7 points, 6.7 assists, and 3.6 rebounds in 77 games.\n\nFans are eagerly anticipating Game 2 of the playoff series, which is scheduled to take place tomorrow at Madison Square Garden.

The Knicks are the exception to the rule. Charles Barkley posits that he does not like the Jalen Brunson and Tom Thibodeau-led team, via NBA on TNT.\n\n\"I don't care who wins. But, I will tell you, I would love to see their a** stomped by the Celtics. That would be great. Whoever wins this series is going to get stomped by the Celtics. Because you're New York and you all deserve it. You think you're the greatest thing since sliced bread. Come on, you ain't that good in New York. Y'all overrated. Just because you make good pizza and good bagels?\" the former Most Valuable Player said.\n\nThe Knicks may be too much for Charles Barkley but they surely carried themselves well in this game. They were down by 10 after halftime and it looked like their rotation was going thin, What did Coach Tom Thibodeau do? He employed schemes while his players executed them flawlessly to score 36 points in the third quarter. The most beautiful part of this victory was that they limited the Tyrese Haliburton-led Pacers to just 18 points in those 12 minutes after the half.\n\nThere may be a lot of individuals who do not like the Knicks, including Charles Barkley. But, their undeniable resilience amid big leads and injured players is insane.\n\nKnicks come back to mollywhop the Pacers\n\nWhen Jalen Brunson went down, it looked like this NBA Playoffs series was going to take a swing in momentum. Coach Tom Thibodeau did not allow that to happen. Then, OG Anunoby was the next player to head out towards the locker room. That also was not an excuse for them to give a mediocre performance at home. This very high standard led them to dominate their opponents quite well.\n\nThe Knicks knocked down 57% of all their shots from the three levels of scoring to win 130 to 121. More impressively, they also did well in attacking the perimeter. This netted them an insane 46.7% three-point percentage too. The other aspect that the Knicks dominated was the glass. They had 44 total rebounds with 32 of them coming from the defensive end. It was a great display of closing out possessions and making the Pacers pay for not executing well on offense.\n\nAny time that the Tyrese Haliburton-led squad tried to create momentum to get back into the game, their ball handlers were hounded. The Knicks stole the ball five times in this NBA Playoffs matchup while also generating three blocks.

That's why the Manhattanites hosted a bunch of Hoosiers on Wednesday for Game 2 of the second-round series between Indiana and New York and beat them on one leg.\n\nNot everything was rosy for the Knicks, mind you, as Jalen Brunson missed ample time because making his Willis Reedian return to lift New York, and OG Anunoby will probably miss one or two or more games following his hamstring injury.\n\nAnyway, it's time to celebrate the Knicks as they lead the Pacers 2-0 entering Game 3. Here's all you need to know, straight from the raw sources.\n\nOn Jalen Brunson's approach to the game...\n\n\"The thing that's impressive, it's always within the context of winning and his teammates and that's always the most important thing to him. And I love his mentality because his mentality is that he's not satisfied.\"\n\n\"He's a great leader, so I think the players all have respect for that, when a guy goes out and is willing to give whatever he has, and so that says a lot about him.\"\n\nOn Precious Achiuwa's contributions in Game 2 getting 28 minutes of playing time off the pine...\n\n\"Yeah, it was huge. I thought he played very well in the fourth quarter. We need that from him.\"\n\nOn OG Anunoby's best postseason game to date and his injury status...\n\n\"I thought he was super-aggressive. He played really, really well, I thought at the end of Game 1 with his defensive activity. And he picked up right where he left off, and I thought that was huge for us and I thought that's what got us off to a good start.\"\n\n\"It was huge. Huge. The way he got [his points], too, it was a little bit of everything. He made a nice play to Isaiah, a dribble handoff, we got a dunk I think off that. He ran the floor, hit threes, he was good in transition, he put in on the floor, he attacked the rim, he was decisive. All positive things.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure [his status]. I haven't talked to medical yet.\"\n\nOn playing 48 minutes in back-to-back games without the need of a break...\n\n\"Thibs always asks me if I need one, and I always tell him no. As a competitor, you want to play, you want to play every second. So that's something that I want to do.\"\n\nOn what made it possible for the Knicks to win Game 2...\n\n\"I think shot-making and just sharing the ball. I don't think we really took bad shots.\"\n\nOn how he helped Reggie Miller understand MSG's chants...\n\n\"I just wanted to make sure he heard what the fans were chanting.\"\n\n\"I think they said f-k you. I didn't know if you heard them though.\"\n\nOn his and the Knicks' confidence in beating the Pacers and advancing to the ECF...\n\n\"Just win. Nothing else. All of our games last series were close. This is a really tough team and I anticipate it being a really tough series with close games. We just have to build off that and can't be happy with getting one win. I think we're all confident in our abilities. But we can't rely on that.\"\n\nOn his return to Game 2 after getting to the locker room early with an injury...\n\n\"I had a decision to make and I made a decision.\"\n\nOn the MSG reaction after returning to the floor for warmups ahead of the third quarter...\n\n\"It was really cool to hear, but I just knew that I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half.\"\n\nOn how they are approaching the second-round series against the Pacers...\n\n\"We just find a way. No matter what it is, we just give each other confidence to make sure we can get the job done. So it's nothing in particular. It's just the group of guys we have, we give each other confidence and move forward together.\"\n\n\"You develop it over your career, so it becomes instinctual. So it's just having the force and the confidence to know that you're going to continue to play. Just try and do the right things. No matter what the situation is, we know we're going into it with a fair mind. Just try to play basketball the right way and win games.\"\n\nOn getting mentioned along with some true legends of the game amid his postseason exploits...\n\n\"I understand what's going on, so it's definitely obviously pretty cool, and it makes it better to know that it comes off a win most importantly, but honestly no matter what the situation was, whether it was positive or negative, I have to come back and be better.\"\n\nOn Brunson somehow returning to Game 2 with an injured foot and fighting through the second half willing the Knicks to victory...\n\n\"He's a warrior. That's all I got. There was no doubt in my mind that he'll be back. All season long, no matter what is thrown at him, injury bug or whatever, he always bounces back. And we knew the severity of the game and everything, so we knew, everybody had confidence he was coming back.\"\n\nOn Brunson's MVP-caliber season...\n\n\"He knows what he's doing but he doesn't address it. He's just trying to get better every single day. Not being him and looking on the outside, I love it. I sure as hell love it. I will celebrate every day of the week. That's who he is as a person, not just a basketball player.\"\n\n\"I'm so proud of him, just knowing what type of person he is. He doesn't take praise and accolades and all that stuff. He doesn't take it well. He always knows there's going to be more doubters, more things to improve on. That's his beauty as a person.\"\n\nOn what makes Brunson great...\n\n\"I say this all year, Jalen ends up with 40-something points, but he makes the right play. The right play [at the end of Game 1] was they're coming to double and he kicks it.\"\n\n\"He's not a guy that says I've got 40, I've got to will this team and I have to do it solely with just my points. He knows his opportunities, when to be aggressive and take over, and he also knows the situation when 'OK, they're sending bodies at me. Somebody is open and this is the right play.' He lives with the results.\"\n\n\"Look at Game 6 (against the 76ers), what he did with Josh. They sent two at him and he trusts Josh to make that shot. It's something that I've heard. I watched. I wasn't in the locker room last year. That really stuck with him and you can see it all season long.\"\n\n\"He just makes the right play over and over again.\"\n\nOn how he managed to stay ready to slide into the rotation midway through the playoffs...\n\n\"I want to give my teammates credit, they do a great job. We play pickup sometimes, that helps me a lot, stay in game shape, stay in rhythm, stuff like that. A lot of credit to my teammates for backing me with that.\"\n\nOn the Knicks mantra...\n\n\"I don't know what the situation is [with Anunoby] as of right now. That's between him and the medical and the team. But there's always a next-man up mentality on this team. We have a bunch of winners who are going to come in and contribute in any way they can.\"\n\nOn New York's depth helping the team lead the second-round series 2-0 even with a bunch of players out injured...\n\n\"It just goes to show you it's a bunch of dogs on the team.\"\n\n\"Guys were locked in, ready to come in and play their parts for the most part. There's a lot of guys that love to win on the team, so you can't ask for nothing more than that. Once you have a bunch of guys that enjoy winning, and are willing to do whatever it takes to win a basketball game, you can go far with that.\"\n\nOn how he's approaching the playoffs and accepting his role in the team...\n\n\"I just think it's next man up. My thing, I got to continue to go out there and play the right way, play winning basketball. We've shown that in the past. Just got to continue to go out there and do what we need to win basketball games.\"\n\nOn one of many calls reversed by the officials in a Game 2 that surely was cooked by the NBA so the big-market Knicks could get the win...\n\n\"One [referee] just said he didn't double dribble, but it looked like [Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau] went out there and argued and they changed it. That's what it looked like. I can only go by what I saw. That's small beans compared to everything else.\"\n\n\"Small market teams deserve an equal shot. They deserve a fair shot no matter where they're playing.\"\n\nOn not complaining about the officiating but inadvertently doing so...\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials. But we deserve a fair shot. There's not a consistent balance and that's disappointing.\"\n\nOn Josh Hart's rebounding prowess...\n\n\"We just got to match [his energy] and I think that's the biggest thing. Obviously, you've got to rebound and he's probably one of the best rebounding wings in the league, if not the best rebounding wing in the league.\"\n\nOn Josh Hart never running out of gas...\n\n\"He's full effort for 48 minutes. We gotta find where he's at. We gotta be able to box him out. We gotta keep him out of transition. We just gotta do a better job on him as a whole.\"\n\nOn Josh Hart's winning mentality...\n\n\"He's a dog. He does everything he needs to do for that team. But what we need to do is lock into everything Coach has been telling us what to do to stop those guys who are impacting the game.\"\n\nOn the Knicks outlook for the remainder of the playoffs...\n\n\"People think we care who wins. If the Knicks win that'll be good. I don't care who wins. but I'll tell you what: I would love to see they ass get stomped by the Celtics, that'd be great. I'm just saying, whoever wins this series gonna get stomped by the Celtics.\"\n\nOn what makes New York City great...\n\n\"New Yorkers y'all deserve it.

Shortly before fans tuned in to see if Jalen Brunson could pass Michael Jordan and become just the second NBA player ever to score 40-plus points in five consecutive playoff games, it was announced that Nikola Jokic had won the league's MVP award.\n\nThis, of course, was no big surprise. The Denver big man had once again dominated the regular season on the way to earning the MVP award for the third time in his nine-year career.\n\nStill, would Jokic be a repeat winner if media members voted the day after the NBA Finals instead of the day after the last day of the regular season. Considering that Jokic's Nuggets team is 0-2 against Minnesota in their second-round series, one has to wonder.\n\nJokic was a runaway winner with 926 votes. He was followed by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brunson, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Edwards, Domantas Sabonis and Kevin Durant.\n\nIn his pregame news conference Wednesday before the voting was announced, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said he thinks it makes sense to wait until after the postseason to take the vote.\n\n\"What is it? Is it the MVP for the entire season or regular season?\" Thibodeau said. \"There's a number of deserving candidates and certainly we feel Jalen is very deserving as well .\u2002.\u2002. You hate to leave anyone off, that's the reality of it. I prefer to wait until everything is done so you can look at everything.\"\n\nNo player has been more important to his team this postseason than Brunson, who entered Wednesday night's game at Madison Square Garden having scored 47, 40, 41 and 43 in his last four games. The only other players ever to have scored 40 or more points in four consecutive playoff games are Jerry West, who had a six-game streak, Jordan (four) and Bernard King (four).\n\nThat's some pretty heady company, as Brunson's closest friends are only too happy to needle him about. After Brunson scored 43 points Monday to give the Knicks a 1-0 lead in their series with the Pacers, he and fellow Villanova alum Donte DiVincenzo were next to one another at a news conference when a reporter rattled off the list of Hall of Famers who also had four consecutive 40-plus games.\n\nVincenzo, who at Villanova was once nicknamed \"The Michael Jordan of Delaware\" by coach Jay Wright, lit up at the mention of the Bulls great.\n\nBrunson later explained that his close friends \"are all sarcastic,\" so he had to cut DiVincenzo off when he could.\n\nAll joking aside, it's incredible what Brunson has been able to do so far in the playoffs, averaging a league-best 36.6 points in seven games against the 76ers and the Pacers heading into Wednesday night. Brunson is the first player in league history with at least 40 points and five assists in four consecutive playoff games.\n\nBrunson has said he doesn't want to think about it in the middle of a series, that he's just trying to do what he has to do to get his team to win games.\n\n\"I understand what's going on, so it's definitely obviously pretty cool, and it makes it better to know that it comes off a win most importantly, but honestly no matter what the situation was, whether it was positive or negative, I have to come back and be better,\" Brunson said.\n\n\"Last series [against Philadelphia], the first two games I was awful, and for me, I do have to be better, so I have to put that in the back of my mind. This is the same thing.\"\n\nOne reason DiVincenzo and Josh Hart, the third Villanova Knick, like giving Brunson a hard time is that he has never been all that comfortable talking about individual honors.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him, just knowing what type of person he is,\" DiVincenzo said of Brunson. \"He doesn't take praise and accolades and all that stuff. He doesn't take it well. He's always trying to get better. He always knows there's going to be more doubters.\"\n\nAfter this postseason, the bet is there won't be that many.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_King", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernard King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domantas_Sabonis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domantas Sabonis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Wright (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:YTg3MTBlNjMtMGZiNy00:Y2Y1NGZl/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Neither scored over 20 points in Game 1 and Haliburton even finished with more assists than shot attempts. The Knicks defense is talented, but to shut down the league's assist leader like that is a terrible look for both the Pacers and Haliburton moving forward.\n\nWithout their star point guard's normal production, Indiana has little to no chance of staying afloat this series, especially since Haliburton is the buoyancy that usually keeps the Pacers' ship balanced. If that won't be the case, New York is going to let Turner and McConnell try and beat them with Indiana's only real hope being the bench scoring near 50 points again Game 2.\n\nSleeper offers some of the best and easiest-to-win NBA DFS games in the industry. Sleeper DFS works just like regular player prop betting -- there are no large-field tournaments in which to get lost. You're not playing against other people; you're just playing against the projections. Here are some of our favorite NBA prop picks for Wednesday's game.\n\nIf the Pacers bench is taking on a more demanding role to make up for the starters, Ben Sheppard's spacing is going to continue to get him the attempts we need. He played less than 20 minutes Game 1, but shooting four three's and scoring eight points in a loss is a great sign for someone hoping to capitalize on a 3.5 point over bet. Playing behind both Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard creates an obvious limit, but Indiana needs scoring and Sheppard is the lone quick-trigger on the Pacer's bench.\n\nThat alone is going to get him 15 minutes and enough attempts to hit the over, he just needs to actually hit the shots. With the limited minutes that's a justifiable concern, but McConnell scoring 18 points on 15 shots is precisely what the Knicks defense wants and it led to New York stealing Game 1. That type of efficiency from a bench player is arguably game-changing and with Sheppard already showing positive signs, don't be surprised if they look his way more often.\n\nThe Pacers have been carried by Myles Turner this postseason and surprisingly it's been through his shooting. Normally, defense is the staple that drives his impact, but outside Games 5 & 6 of the Pacers last series versus the Bucks, Turner has been the focal point of the offense. He scored over 20 points three games in a row, forcing Milwaukee to lock him down first and foremost, leading to other Pacers picking up the slack and ultimately cruising into the second round. This offense has no choice but to ride until the wheels fall off and that is solely dependent on the spacing Turner offers each night.\n\nSo far, it's hard to say it's not working since the blame for losing Game 1 lies solely on the shoulders of the Pacer's two highest paid players, Pascal Siakam and Tyrese Haliburton, not the one player who actually scored that game. Turner knows his role and that's not going to change this late in the season. He'll keep fading on those pick-and-roll and until he's seriously cooled off, unders below 20 points are in serious jeopardy with how well and how much he is shooting.\n\nThere had to be one Knick featured in this article and of course it's going to be none other than Jalen Brunson. Josh Hart combination overs look great across the board now that he's not settling for bad shots, and O.G. Anunoby's assist and rebound prop lines are considerably low given the fact he's hit this over on rebounds alone in three of his last four games. However, the one guy that makes it all possible is Jalen Brunson. The best part about taking the over is that it doesn't matter what happens in the first three quarters because the fourth is Brunson's.\n\nHow much time can you spend trying to hype up someone that time and time again speaks for themselves. Brunson's last game was just another notch in the ever-growing belt of one of the league's best players. If that's not clear, how many more times does he need to prove it?

Big picture, there was the...ahem...interesting disparity in what qualified as a foul when Jalen Brunson went to the basket vs. when Tyrese Maxey did. As more of a snapshot, the end of Game 2 will haunt the franchise for quite some time, as the refs both didn't grant a timeout to Nick Nurse and deemed the equivalent of Maxey being mauled by a pack of hyenas as marginal contact.\n\nThey say misery loves company, so in watching the end of Monday night's Game 1 between the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers, there was a lot of what I might term relief for Sixers fans at what transpired. 'There, you see! We're not crazy! They're the ones who are crazy!'\n\nIn the third quarter, this play was originally called a foul on Jalen Brunson, but the Knicks challenged and it was OVERTURNED. I mean, how?\n\nIn the words of Jacobim Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!\n\nWe'll zoom ahead and, naturally, a game involving the Knicks came down to the final minute. Just like against the Sixers, multiple calls seemed to objectively go against the Pacers in favor of the Knicks.\n\nWith the game tied and under a minute left, the refs called this pass that hit off Aaron Nesmith's hand a kicked ball.\n\nIndiana should have had a man advantage going the other way in transition. Instead, New York retained the ball and would then hit a three-pointer on the possession. The postgame pool report confirmed it was the incorrect call.\n\nYou could have also called that play a moving screen on Donte DiVincenzo, by the way.\n\nThis is an important note, because later in the final minute we have the coup de grace. With Indiana down by one and having the ball for what could be the final possession, Myles Turner is called for a moving screen on this play.\n\nOther angles make it look like a clear flop by DiVincenzo.\n\nThe Knicks would go on to win, 121-117, and Joel Embiid had thoughts on the matter.\n\nThe conspiracy theorists were out in full force, and here's how a lot of Sixers fans were thinking about things.\n\nSour grapes?

But the Celtics were even more efficient from the outside, connecting on 18 of 46 from beyond the arc for the game.\n\nIt helped Boston carry a 15-point lead into the fourth quarter. The Celtics then started the final period on a 10-2 run to increase their lead to 102-79.\n\nDonovan Mitchell had 33 points and six assists for the Cavaliers. He is the fourth player in league history to score 30 or more points in six straight playoff series openers, joining Michael Jordan (three times), Kobe Bryant and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nDarius Garland added 14 points.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night in Boston.\n\nWhite picked up where he left off after scoring 38 and 25 points in the final two games against the Miami Heat in the first round.\n\nWith the Cavaliers hot from the 3-point line early, White led the Celtics attack. It was his third time this postseason with at least six 3s.\n\nBoth teams played without their starting centers. Cleveland's Jarrett Allen missed his fourth straight game with a bruised rib injury he sustained in the first round against Orlando. Boston's Kristaps Porzingis was sidelined for the second consecutive game with a strained right calf.\n\nThe top-seeded Celtics got an extended break after making quick work of the Heat in the first round. They looked like a rested team, jumping out to a 12-2 lead, with nine of those points coming from Brown.\n\nMitchell was just as aggressive for Cleveland, scoring eight points during a 21-9 spurt by the Cavaliers to nudge back in front.\n\nBut Boston settled down, closing the opening period on a 19-11 run to take a 40-34 edge into the second.\n\nThe 74 combined points in the opening period were the most in a Celtics' playoff game since 1990 and third-most in franchise history.\n\nThe Celtics took a 59-49 lead into halftime.\n\nReferees acknowledge incorrectly called kicked ball on Pacers late in loss to Knicks\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Referees said they incorrectly called a late kicked ball violation Monday night against the Indiana Pacers, who by rule couldn't challenge the play.\n\nThe Pacers and New York Knicks were tied at 115 with 52 seconds remaining when Aaron Nesmith appeared to knock away a pass Jalen Brunson was attempting to throw to Donte DiVincenzo. The Pacers could have come up with the ball for a steal, but referee Sean Wright said Nesmith hit it with his foot, allowing the Knicks to retain possession.\n\nNew York took the lead for good 12 seconds later when DiVincenzo made a 3-pointer and won 121-117 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nAfter the game, crew chief Zach Zarba said the call was incorrect.\n\n\"On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation,\" Zarba said. \"Postgame review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal.\"\n\nZarba added that the Pacers could not have challenged the call, saying those can only be used for fouls, goaltending calls and out-of-bounds calls.\n\nThe Pacers felt a subsequent call went against them, when Myles Turner was called for a offensive foul on a pick that knocked DiVincenzo to the court with 12 seconds to play. Indiana did challenge that one, with the call being upheld on review.\n\n\"Just in my experience in this league I think it's best when you let the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said. \"I think it's unfortunate that it happened ... called it an illegal screen. It's the playoffs. I think DiVincenzo did a good job selling it. For the most part you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs. We have to take accountability as well. We know at the end of the day we can't get to that position.\"\n\nThe Pacers won their other challenge, getting a foul on Tyrese Haliburton overturned with the game tied at 113-all with 1:51 remaining.\n\n\"I think the two controversial calls, we had to use our challenge on one call (on) Tyrese, then the kicked ball on Aaron Nesmith that was not a kickball. You can clearly see that on the replays,\" Turner added. \"So, it's unfortunate but we can't put ourselves in that position.\"", "source": {"uri": "bradfordera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Turner turns into Donte DiVincenzo's path and does not give him time and distance to change direction prior to the illegal contact,\" the Last 2 Minute report said.\n\nTurner ripped the officiating after their loss.\n\n\"We're all looking forward to that coming out,\" Turner said of the Last 2 Minute Report. \"In my experience in this league, I think it's the best when the players decide the outcome of the game. I think it's unfortunate it happened. We reviewed it and they still called it illegal screen, but it's the playoffs, man. I feel like [Donte] DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it.\"\n\nBut Turner was correct on the other controversial late-game call -- a kickball violation on his Pacers teammate Aaron Nesmith which preceded before DiVincenzo's go-ahead 3-pointer.\n\n\"That was not a kick ball,\" Turner said. \"You can clearly see on the replay.\"\n\nThe Last 2 Minute Report agreed with Turner.\n\n\"Nesmith makes contact to the ball with his hand, not his foot,\" the Last 2 Minute report said.\n\nHowever, it added there is no replay trigger to review a kicked ball call.\n\nCrew chief Zach Zarba acknowledged their mistake after the game in the pool report.\n\n\"Postgame review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal,\" Zarba told pool reporter Fred Katz of The Athletic.\n\nThere were a total of four missed calls inside the last two minutes of the tightly contested Game 1.\n\nTwo of them went Turner and the Pacers' way.\n\nThe referees missed a defensive three seconds violation on Turner with 1:19 left. They also did not see the separate Turner illegal screen on DiVincenzo in the backcourt with about 10 seconds remaining.\n\nTurner, who scored 23 points but only pulled down two rebounds, will have one less headache in Game 2.\n\nKnicks center Mitchell Robinson has been ruled out for Tuesday's Game 2 due to a left ankle injury management.\n\nRobinson played only 12 minutes off the bench in Game 1, scoring on an alley-oop dunk -- the lone field goal made by the Knicks' second unit.\n\nWithout Robinson, Thibodeau is left with no choice but to use the smaller Precious Achiuwa extensively as Isaiah Hartenstein's backup.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Achiuwa only saw action for four minutes in Game 1, scoring a free throw and pulling down one rebound. He also barely saw playing time in their first-round win against the Philadelphia 76ers, appearing in only two games.\n\nBut Achiuwa played solid in the regular season especially during Robinson's lengthy absence while recovering from his ankle surgery. The 6-foot-8 Achiuwa averaged 8.4 points, 7.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 26.1 minutes across 40 games without Robinson since the Knicks acquired him as part of the OG Anunoby trade.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

You never see that call at this point in the game. I mean, never,\" Van Gundy said. \"That is a great acting job. Lotta great actors here in New York City; you see 'em on Broadway all the time. That's as good an acting job as you'll see. He technically was moving a little bit. Wow, did Donte DiVincenzo act on that one.\"\n\nIndiana challenged the call but it was not overturned, and the Knicks scored the final three points to ice the game.\n\nThe NBA's Last Two Minute Report will provide more details on the call, but experts seemed to have two main issues with the call.\n\nThe first is simply that, well, you don't call that foul in that spot.\n\nIt seemed most agreed that even if Turner was slightly moving in that spot, like offensive holding in the NFL, you could call that foul on each play in the game.\n\nA similar call ruined Iowa's Final Four win over UConn and earned condemnation.\n\n\"You don't make that call at this stage of the game. HORRIBLE!\" ESPN's Jay Williams tweeted.\n\nYahoo's Tom Haberstroh mentioned how the referees overruled an earlier call on Jalen Brunson with plenty of contact but then ruled Turner crossed a line.\n\n\"How was that Brunson block not a foul on review but that moving screen is a foul,\" Haberstroh posted. \"Don't answer that.\"\n\nSome also seemed to think that DiVincenzo flopped.\n\n\"That is a horrific call,\" Doug Gottlieb posted. \"I love everything about Nova guys, except how much they flop.\"\n\nThe general consensus among analysts seemed to be that the referees just needed to swallow their whistle in that spot and let the teams decide the outcome.\n\n\"Knicks probably win that game w/o the bad calls. But you can't call that illegal screen and not expect it to be the story of the game,\" Andrew Perloff tweeted. \"Officials screwed everyone.\"\n\nAdded Knicks fan Rob Perez, known as WorldWideWob on X: \"I don't feel like we got away with one, and you can't convince me otherwise. I hate that the conversation from this awesome game will revolve around the officiating in the final minute.

This came after he showed frustration when a double-dribble was initially called against the Knicks but then overturned.\n\nWith just 34 seconds remaining, Carlisle received a second technical foul and was subsequently ejected from the game.\n\nJalen Brunson capitalized on the situation by sinking both technical free throws.\n\nThere have been controversial calls left and right in the series, and after the game, Carlisle said the calls mostly affected the Pacers adversely and he had to let the officials know about it.\n\n\"The two technicals, you know, you gotta make a stand for your guys. You gotta stand up for what's right and what's not right, and that was it. So, we need to get home, we need to play better,\" he said.\n\nThe series has been filled with controversial calls, and following the game, Carlisle expressed that most of these calls had a negative impact on the Pacers. He said he felt compelled to have the officials hear all about it.\n\nIn terms of free throws, the Pacers attempted 17 and made 10, while the Knicks went 18 for 22 from the charity stripe.\n\nRick Carlisle calls out officiating in Knicks-Pacers\n\nAfter the game, Rick Carlisle mentioned that the Pacers were supposed to submit video clips to the NBA office to protest certain calls but decided against it, expecting improved officiating in Game 2. However, Carlisle expressed disappointment as it turned out that this was not the case.\n\n\"When you submit things, the other team sees what you submit. There were 29 plays in Game 1 that we thought were clearly called the wrong way. I decided not to submit them because I just felt like, you know, we'd get a more balanced whistle tonight. It didn't feel that way,\" he said.\n\nOne instance Carlisle cited was when Haliburton was pushed during a fastbreak in the third quarter.\n\nCarlisle said the Pacers would be submitting clips of Game 2 to the league.\n\n\"I'm always talking to our guys about not making it about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot, you know? There's not a consistent balance, and that's disappointing,\" he said.\n\n\"Give New York credit for the physicality that they're playing with, but their physicality is rewarded, and ours is penalized time after time. So, you know, it's just, I'm just really disappointed. It's really disappointing.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_ezekiel_hirro@sportskeeda.com", "name": "John Ezekiel Hirro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23224751-1715225694.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

It won the game. None of that is disputed.\n\nBut there are a three other names who also played an indisputable role in determining the outcome of this game: Zach Zarba. Sean Wright and Tyler Ford. These were the officials for Game 1, and without singling anyone out, they were, collectively, atrocious down the stretch of this game, particularly in the final minute, and they very well might've cost Indiana the game.\n\nLet's not even get into the \"marginal contact\" overturn in the first half when Brunson clearly body-checked Myles Turner, which allowed Tom Thibodeau to retain a challenge for later in the game, which came in quite handy when he needed what was originally ruled a Brunson turnover (correctly) reversed with 22 seconds left in a one-point game.\n\nThe officials were screwing up calls left and right down the stretch, including one that went in Indiana's favor when Tyrese Haliburton had his foul correctly overturned with 1:51 to play in a tie game when he clearly hit nothing but ball on his swipe.\n\nThese were game-swinging calls, bad ones, and having the opportunity to go the replay monitor to have these officials correct their mistake(s) was vital. The problem was, Indiana didn't have that replay opportunity with 52 seconds to play in a tie game when Aaron Nesmith was whistled for a kicked ball when he clearly hit the ball with his hand.\n\nAfter the game, crew chief Zach Zarba admitted that the call was botched, and more importantly, that a kicked-ball violation is not reviewable, which is absurd. What could be easier, and quicker, to review than whether a ball was kicked? Why even have replay?\n\nIt was a bad call. It's an even worse rule. And it cost the Pacers big time, because not only did they have a transition possession taken from them on what was a clear steal in a tie game, but 12 seconds later Donte DiVincenzo hit what proved to be the game-winning 3-pointer.\n\nThe Pacers, of course, had one last shot at their own game-winner with possession of the ball, down one, with 12 seconds left. That opportunity was stolen from them, too, when Turner was called for what can only be described as an absolutely bogus illegal screen.\n\nI don't even know where to start with this, but I suppose I'll first address the fact that the Pacers challenged the call and lost the challenge. That does not mean this was the right call just because it was upheld upon review. Yeah, Turner is technically moving, and I suspect that's what the league affirm in its Last Two-Minute report on Tuesday, too. Once that was called on the floor, it was never going to get overturned.\n\nIt never should've been called in the first place. This was not a \"50-50 call\" that could've gone either way. This exact screen is set all game long in every single NBA game you watch. It is not, I assure you, called as an illegal screen 50% of the time. If it was, there would be about 30 illegal screens a game. In reality, this is about a 20-80 call, at best.\n\nBut even if it was a true 50-50 call, then that, by definition, makes it a judgment call, and to say it was poor judgment to make that call at that point in the game would be an understatement. Personally, I would call it a total joke. If it's at all possible, you let the players decide the games. You have a higher standard for fouls in the fourth quarter, and certainly in the closing minutes, of a tight playoff game.\n\nIt's no different than a player having to be extra sure of his shot selection in the final two minutes of a game. To say \"a foul in the first quarter is a foul in the fourth quarter\" is akin to saying an ill-advised shot in the first quarter is no different than jacking up a bad shot with two minutes to go in a tie playoff game. That's a lie, and anyone who has ever played basketball at any sort of competitive level would say as much. The shot in the fourth quarter is infinitely worse. So is the case with the \"judgment\" call that was made on Monday, and a handful of others.\n\nAlso, spare me with the \"it's so hard to be an NBA official\" sympathy note. Of course it's hard. That's why these men and women are supposed to be the absolute best of the best. Same as an NBA player, any one of whom would get absolutely roasted if they made this many mistakes inside the final two minutes of a tie playoff game.\n\nThese refs deserve the same heat. I don't care what the Last Two-Minute report says. I don't care what the Pool Report says. I don't care that Pacers coach Rick Carlisle, admirably, opted for the \"that's just the way it goes\" high road in his postgame interview. I don't care what anyone says, really. I know what I watched, and it was basketball robbery.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_botkin@cbssports.com", "name": "Brad Botkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/07/23d8f7a4-e561-47a0-bebb-e75f1e9498f9/thumbnail/1200x675/601612e873fe7d732eee89a232c347a2/untitled-design-60.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, the offensive foul called against Indiana center Myles Turner was deemed to be a correct call.\n\nNeither of these findings should be seen as surprising. After New York's 121-117 win on Monday, crew chief Zach Zarba told a pool reporter that, upon reviewing the kicked ball post-game, it was evident that the ball \"hit the defender's hand, which would be legal.\" Immediately after the foul on Turner was called, it was challenged, reviewed and upheld. According to the L2M report, the big man turns into the path of Knicks wing Donte DiVincenzo and \"does not give him time and distance to change direction prior to the illegal contact.\"\n\nAfter the loss, Turner said that the team was \"looking forward\" to this report. He added that, while the Pacers shouldn't \"look too much into the two minute report,\" he anticipated that there would be \"some glaring things in it.\"\n\nHere is a complete list of the calls and non-calls in the final two minutes identified by the league as incorrect:\n\n1:19: On a possession that ended with Knicks star Jalen Brunson making a game-tying jumper over Andrew Nembhard, Turner should have been called for a three-second violation.0:53.6: Just prior to the (incorrect) kicked ball violation, DiVincenzo should have been called for an offensive foul against Nesmith, as he \"clamps his arm and prevents him from disengaging.\" 0:52: With the score tied and Indiana starting a fast break, Nesmith should not have been called for a kicked ball violation. As noted in the L2M report, this call cannot be challenged.0:10.7: On Indiana's last offensive possession, down by four points, Turner should have been called for another offensive foul a few seconds before Haliburton turned the ball over, as the big man \"extends\" into DiVincenzo's path and \"delivers contact with his side during the screen.\"\n\nNone of this will likely satisfy any Pacers fan (or player) who was upset at the officiating in crunch time. Indiana coach Rick Carlislie, however, said both postgame and after practice at the National Basketball Players Association's office the following day that the team needed to focus on the things it could have done better throughout the entire game, not the calls that were made near the end.\n\n\"There's a lot of events that didn't happen in the last minute of the game, that didn't get the limelight of the analysis of everyone in the media, in the basketball world, that were things we could have done better,\" Carlisle said Tuesday. \"So our game is a 48-minute game, it's not a two-minute game. The things in the first, second and third quarter that happen -- that are good or bad -- matter in the result. We're an accumulation of our habits, and so our habits got to be good from start to finish.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_herbert@cbssports.com", "name": "James Herbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/07/cc353677-d94d-4c0e-8b46-20d92b3faabb/thumbnail/1200x675/b9f76819d85b19e35fcb6c0c96c4d88e/knicks-pacers-getty-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

The only players left in the locker room when reporters got there after coach Rick Carlisle's press conference were veterans Myles Turner and T.J. McConnell, who had agreed to podium press conferences of their own.\n\nThey had reason to want to bail before reporters got there, as they were going to have to navigate minefields knowing that whatever they said about the critical calls late in their 121-117 loss to the Knicks could have a financial penalty attached.\n\nHowever, forward Aaron Nesmith was stopped in the hallway and he stated what he considered to be the obvious -- that with 52.1 seconds left and the game tied at 115, he deflected a pass with his hand that was called a kicked ball, stopping play dead instead of giving the Pacers a steal that they could have turned into a fast-break bucket. That Knicks possession turned into a 3-pointer by guard Donte DiVincenzo that gave the Knicks the lead for good.\n\n\"It hit my hand,\" Nesmith said. \"It wasn't a kicked ball. You can clearly see it.\"\n\nWithin the hour, the NBA released a pool report saying that upon review, the game's officials agreed with Nesmith. In an interview with Fred Katz of The Athletic, the pool reporter for the game, crew chief Zach Zarba said: \"On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation. Post game review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal.\"\n\nHowever, as Zarba noted in his next answer, a kicked ball is not a reviewable play by league rules. So once the kicked ball was called, there was nothing they could do to fix the call.\n\n\"A kicked ball violation is not reviewable and not subject to the coach's challenge,\" Zarba said. \"The three things that teams can challenge are fouls, goaltends and out of bounds.\"\n\nThat wasn't the only controversial call in the game's final minute, let alone the final quarter. With 12 seconds left, the Pacers had the ball and were down 118-117 when Turner was called for an offensive foul for an illegal screen on DiVincenzo. DiVincenzo sold the foul hard by falling down, and the Pacers challenged the call, but upon review it was upheld.\n\nTurner and Pacers coach Rick Carlisle both addressed that call but treaded lightly.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the officiating,\" Carlisle said. \"We're not expecting to get calls in here. It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. That's just the way it goes. We challenged it. They reviewed it, and they had a bunch of people in New Jersey that agreed with them. So that's just the way it goes.\"\n\nTurner also said he wished the foul had not been called, but also said he understood why it was.\n\n\"In my experience in this league, I think it's best when the players decide the outcome of the game,\" Turner said. \"I think it's unfortunate that it happened. We reviewed it and they still called it an illegal screen, but it's the playoffs man. I felt like DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it.\"\n\nAnd Turner also acknowledged that the Pacers had themselves to blame for putting themselves in a position to allow the game to be decided by controversial calls. They had a lead as great as nine points and they had breakdowns in the second half in areas where they had done well in the first. After allowing just two offensive rebounds and three second-chance points in the first half, they gave up six in the second that turned into 13 points and helped turn the game. They allowed the Knicks to score 72 points after the break on 65% shooting.\n\n\"For the most part, you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs,\" Turner said. \"We have to take accountability as well. Of course, it's right after the game, I'm fresh with my emotions about it. But we know at the end of the day that we can't let it get to that position.\"\n\nAnd that's generally the stance the Pacers are trying to take as they move on from Game 1, which they consider a missed opportunity, even though the officiating did not help their cause.\n\n\"We can't worry about the officiating,\" McConnell said. \"They're just trying to do their job. There were many plays that we could have made where it didn't come down to that. That's the stuff that we can control.\"\n\nThat's not to say, however, that they won't have any interest when the NBA's Last Two-Minute Report comes out on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're all looking forward to that coming out,\" Turner said. \"... The kicked ball from Aaron Nesmith was not a kicked ball. You can clearly see that on the replay. It's unfortunate, but we can't put ourselves in that position.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

They're up 2-0 in their playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, and look to be on a collision course with the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals. Even with all the injuries the Knicks have dealt with, they've managed to find a way to pull out wins, and that's primarily due to the trio of Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\nBrunson is the head of the snake, scoring 40+ points during a four-game stretch, joining an exclusive club in the process. Hart is the Swiss army knife, capable of making the hustle plays, playing lockdown defense and hitting crucial 3s when needed. And DiVincenzo is the 3-point marksman, shooting 41.7% from deep through the playoffs. But before these three were lighting up Madison Square Garden, they were teammates at Villanova, helping win NCAA championships in 2016 and 2018.\n\nFormer Villanova head coach Jay Wright has seen these guys shine bright on the biggest stage, but even he didn't think what they're doing, specifically Brunson, was possible.\n\n\"I didn't think (Brunson) would be this good,\" Wright said during an exclusive appearance this week on CBS Sports' Beyond the Arc podcast. \"I thought he would be a point guard on an NBA championship team because he's such a winner. I thought he'd get with a Luka Doncic -- I thought that was a great situation for him. I thought he'd get with a Luka Doncic and lead a team to an NBA playoff. Maybe a more talented player might be the leading scorer, but he'd be the leader. When that talented player got hurt sometimes and he needed to score, he'd score. That's what I thought his NBA career would be.\"\n\nListen to the full interview between Jay Wright and John Gonzalez below and subscribe to the Beyond the Arc podcast for new episodes throughout the NBA playoffs.\n\nAfter being drafted in the second round by the Mavericks in 2018 -- the same draft they landed Luka Doncic in -- Brunson primarily came off the bench in each of his first three seasons. He averaged modest numbers through those years, but was always second fiddle to Doncic.\n\nBrunson really started to show signs of becoming something more than just a solid role player in his fourth season. He became a full-time starter, and averaged 16.3 points while shooting over 50% from the floor. When Doncic missed the first two games of the playoffs that year, Brunson is the one who put the Mavericks on his back. He dropped 41 points in Game 2 of that series against the Jazz, and the Mavericks not only won that round, but made it to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2011. Had it not been for Brunson shouldering the offense in those early games, and continuously putting up big numbers as the playoffs carried on, Dallas wouldn't have made it that far.\n\nFollowing that season, Brunson then decided to sign with the Knicks instead of staying with the Mavericks, a decision that was seen as betting on himself to prove he can be the No. 1 guy on a team.\n\n\"By him choosing to go to the Knicks, he chose being the go-to guy over being the complementary guy,\" Wright said. \"He had a good thing there in Dallas, and he loved Dallas, and he loved Luka. But he wanted to be the guy. That's just what is so unique about him. It's not selfishness. He wants to lead, and he wants to carry a team. He wants the responsibility. He's such a rare individual.\"\n\nBrunson has shown tenfold that not only is he capable of being the guy he can come up huge in clutch moments. So too have Hart and DiVincenzo. Wright recalled when Hart drilled a deep 3-pointer in his freshman year when Villanova was down five points to Purdue on the road.\n\n\"He's a really unique guy,\" Wright said. \"Throughout his career, one of the things -- he did a lot of great things for us -- but one of the things he always did, he was the same kind of 3-point shooter. He wasn't known as a 3-point shooter, but any big ones, he always hit. It was incredible.\"\n\nHart's shooting 43.9% from deep during the playoffs, and against the Sixers in the first round his 3-point shooting was a key reason why the Knicks were so difficult to beat. He connected on four 3-pointers in three different games, proving that not only is he capable of knocking down big shots, he can be a consistent threat from there, similar to DiVincenzo.\n\n\"One of the things about Josh and Donte is -- and it sounds corny and I hate that it's corny but it's really how these guys think and I think that's what makes them unique and I think people are getting to see it right now. Both of them went into the NBA thinking like 'whatever team I'm on I want to help them win.'\"\n\nThe Nova-Knicks has been a funny moniker because of Brunson, Hart and DiVincenzo all playing together once again. But just like they did in college, they're once again leading their team to a deep postseason run, and Wright is enjoying watching his former players have success at the next level.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmyn_wimbish@cbssports.com", "name": "Jasmyn Wimbish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jay Wright (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/5d6cbfc4-46dc-4055-9142-b6d6432695d6/thumbnail/1200x675/85addada5a05840889b45738d267a01d/jay-wright-knicks-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

He has made the most of the defensive attention he has gotten by opening up opportunities for his teammates.\n\nHow to watch Indiana Pacers vs. New York Knicks Game 2?\n\nTNT and TruTV will broadcast the Indiana Pacers-New York Knicks Game 2, while Bally Sports Indiana and MSG will provide coverage in local regions. Fans abroad can catch live action online via NBA League Pass. Tipoff is at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Knicks are -188 favorites to win with a -4.5 spread. It could be a close game, though. The Pacers received much better contributions from their bench, which could prove crucial. Game 1 also ended with questionable refereeing decisions that favored New York in crunch time, swinging the game away from the Pacers.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arhaan_raje@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arhaan Raje", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSG_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSG Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA League Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TruTV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TruTV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23208125-1715183568.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

So we got to understand that and we got to match that.\"\n\nCarlisle didn't think all of Game 1 was bad. There were a lot of positive takeaways, like the first-half defense and 46 points from the second unit led by TJ McConnell's 18. Still, major changes are needed to take Game 2 in the Garden.\n\n\"The adjustments from Game 1 to Game 2 often seem daunting, but we proved that we can do it in Milwaukee and we're going to have to do it again tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nThe mood at Tuesday's practice was focused but not concerned.

They win Game 1. We come back and we adjust and hopefully, we can get Game 2,\" Carlisle said.\n\nTyrese Halliburton's performance - or lack thereof - was another defining factor of the Pacers' four-point loss. Haliburton had only six points on six shot attempts - a postseason low in both categories. Haliburton took all the responsibility for his poor production Tuesday.\n\n\"(I need to) Be more aggressive,\" Haliburton said. \"Be myself. I just felt like even in Game 1 of the last series, I wasn't being myself, just lack of aggressive, my energy, just everything was off yesterday. I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nHaliburton's not blaming his back spasms on his performance on the court. He said it is what it is - everyone's playing with some sort of injury this time of year.

The model enters the conference semifinals in the 2024 NBA playoffs on a sizzling 94-61 roll on all top-rated NBA picks this season, returning more than $2,800. Anyone following has seen HUGE returns!\n\nThe model knows Indiana forward Pascal Siakam has been a reliable offensive playmaker. Siakam has a smooth game where he can score from the mid-range area and in the lane constantly. He leads the team in both scoring (21.9) and rebounds (8.4) in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. In his last game, Siakam had 19 points and six boards.\n\nThe model also knows New York guard Jalen Brunson has been lighting it up all postseason.

He led the NBA in assists in the regular season and he earned a spot on Team USA for the Olympics over numerous players who scored more points this season for those reasons more than any other. He's the engine that drives the Pacers' offense because he spreads the ball around and finds every one of his teammates in advantageous positions and knows how to maximize their specific skills.\n\nBut he's also one of the Pacers' top scorers --arguably their best perimeter threat when his 3-pointer is going down. And when he's aggressive in looking for his own shot, that tends to help him create opportunities for others as he can get defenses scrambled by getting in the paint or spacing the floor by hitting 3s. He's at his most effective as a passer when he's also scoring, but the flip side of that is that opponents know that and dedicate substantial resources to guarding him and making him uncomfortable. That kind of defensive focus can make it a problem if Haliburton tries to force the issue, which can lead to bad shots and turnovers.\n\nHaliburton left the Pacers' Game 1 121-117 loss to the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals knowing that he'd dramatically failed to strike the balance he wanted. In 36 minutes, he took just six shots, five of them 3-pointers, and just one coming in the paint. He hit a 3-pointer in the first quarter, another in the second, and then he didn't score again. In nearly 19 second-half minutes, he took one shot -- a 3-pointer -- and dished out three assists but also committed three turnovers in the game's final five minutes and was -11 when he was on the floor. He finished with eight assists, not a bad number certainly, but below par from him. The performance stood in stark contrast to that of fellow All-Star Jalen Brunson, who scored 43 points including 21 in the fourth quarter alone with a total of 26 field goal attempts.\n\n\"They're a good defensive team, but I think it's a Tyrese issue more than it's a Knicks issue,\" Haliburton said after practice Tuesday at the court at the NBA Players Association office in midtown Manhattan. \"I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nHaliburton's numbers in Game 1 against the Knicks were strikingly and problematically similar to his numbers in Game 1 against the Bucks. He took just seven shots in that game, hitting four to finish with nine points to go with eight assists. He took just three field goal attempts after halftime, making one for just two points, though he had five assists.\n\nHaliburton noticed the trend as well.\n\n\"I have to be more aggressive, be myself,\" Haliburton said. \"Even in Game 1 of the last series, I wasn't myself. Just lack of aggression, my energy, everything was off (Monday). I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nPart of what's off is he isn't totally healthy. He hasn't mentioned the hamstring strain he suffered in January as a problem in a while, but he has been listed as questionable on the injury report for several games with lower back spasms. He has played through them in every case. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said he expects Haliburton to play through those for Game 2 as well, but acknowledged that it he's not 100%.\n\n\"He's playing through some stuff,\" Carlisle said. \"He'll be on the injury report as questionable for tomorrow with a back thing. I'm confident he'll play. But he is playing through some stuff. ... He's working at it. Doing everything he can to feel as good as possible.\"\n\nHaliburton declined to discuss the effect of the injury in detail.\n\n\"Everybody is going through something right now,\" Haliburton said. \"It's the second round of the playoffs. I'll be fine.\"\n\nHe has played better with the back issue than he did on Monday. He had 17 points and 10 assists in the Pacers' Game 6 win over the Bucks, taking 16 shots, and he scored at least 12 points in Games 2-6 of that series.\n\nHaliburton was asked whether that's a sign that he was feeling out the Knicks in Game 1 after feeling out the Bucks in Game 1 of that series, but he said in both cases he just made poor calculations when it came to determining the balance of creating and attacking.\n\n\"That's a battle I face every game,\" Haliburton said. \"I think every player in this league who is a scorer and a high-usage guy and passes the ball a lot, it's a balance we all have to find. It's not easy. But obviously I erred on the side of playmaking yesterday and that wasn't the right decision for me. I still gotta be who I am.\"\n\nHaliburton was asked if he saw repetitive issue in terms of lack of aggression, if there were places on the floor or scenarios where he saw himself consistently making mistakes by being passive.\n\n\"For sure, but I'm not gonna tell y'all that,\" Haliburton said. \"There are definitely areas where I can be better and I'm aware of that. That's a conversation I'm having with myself every day, having with (personal trainer Drew Hanlen), having with other players, having with coaching staff. I'm definitely aware of it and like I said, I'll be better (Wednesday).\"\n\nCarlisle has been defensive of Haliburton's struggles to score for months.

The Knicks shooting guard has been phenomenal in the postseason on both ends after a rocky start. DiVincenzo has grown into his role as a permanent starter and reliable offensive weapon outside Jalen Brunson for New York.\n\nThat showed in Game 1, as he bagged 25 points, two blocks and two steals on 10-of-17 shooting, including 5-of-9 from the deep with a +10 box +/-. DiVincenzo also hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with the game tied at 115-115 with 40 seconds left. DiVincenzo followed it up by drawing an offensive foul on Myles Turner with 12 seconds left and the Knicks leading by one.\n\nHe has come up with such plays in multiple games during the playoffs, making his availability crucial for the shorthanded Knicks missing Julius Randle, Bojan Bogdanovic and Mitchell Robinson.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo stats vs. Indiana Pacers\n\nDonte DiVincenzo has played 15 games against the Indiana Pacers, including his time with the Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings. He averaged 13.9 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.4 steals, shooting 47.2%, including 38.1% from the 3.\n\nDiVincenzo played three games against the Pacers this year, averaging 24.0 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.0 apg and 2.3 spg, shooting 46.8%, including 36.1% from the 3. The Knicks won only once, but DiVincenzo put up solid performances, including a 38-point effort on Dec. 30, shooting 15-of-21 in a 140-126 loss.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo Stats in 2024 NBA Playoffs\n\nDonte DiVincenzo has averaged 13.9 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.4 apg and 1.1 bpg in the 2024 NBA Playoffs in seven games. He has shot 41.0%, including 39.6% from the 3 and 90.9% from the free throw line.\n\nHe endured a rocky start to the playoffs offensively but has come alive over the past two games. In the closeout Game 6 win over the Philadelphia 76ers in round one, the former Villanova prospect had 23 points, four rebounds, seven assists, three blocks and two steals, shooting 5-of-9 from the 3.\n\nHe followed it up with a 25-point effort in the conference semis series opener against the Indiana Pacers. The improved offense and sustainable defensive intensity have elevated New York's chances of advancing to the conference finals. The Knicks will hope that DiVincenzo remains consistent with his production.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arhaan_raje@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arhaan Raje", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23208103-1715161966.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 1457, "textEnd": 1464}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Why Pacers guard doesn't look like All-Star self in 2024 NBA Playoffs", "body": "Tyrese Haliburton has not looked like himself as of late.\n\nThe spotlight was on the star guard after the Pacers' 121-117 Game 1 loss to the Knicks. He was supposed to contend with Jalen Brunson as the best player in this series. Brunson did his part, scoring 43 points. Haliburton was nowhere to be found, going through a rough 2-of-6 shooting night and scoring just six points.\n\nIf the Pacers are going to win this second-round series, then Haliburton needs to be the best player in it. Instead, he's looked like a glorified role player.\n\nHere's what's been causing the two-time All-Star's struggles.\n\nMORE: Not even Tyrese Haliburton can explain his voice change\n\nThese struggles have been a months-long issue for Haliburton. He started the year looking like he had a chance to make First Team All-NBA, leading the Pacers to the In-Season Tournament Finals.\n\nA hamstring injury on Jan. 8 sidelined him for 10 of the next 11 games, and his play dropped off considerably.\n\nHaliburton acknowledged the slump in March, telling reporters, \"Never went through a slump like this in my life. S -- sucks.\"\n\nThe most noteworthy change in Haliburton post-injury was the giant dip in his 3-point percentage. He had been one of the best pull-up shooters in the league, hitting 39.1 percent of those shots before getting hurt. Since then, he's connected on just 29.1 percent of those shots. He hasn't been able to load up the same on that left leg, and it's clearly affecting his rhythm.\n\nThe loss of Buddy Hield has also hampered Haliburton's effectiveness. The Pacers traded Hield away at the deadline, hoping that they could replace some of his prodigious 3-point shooting with Doug McDermott. That hasn't happened -- McDermott has played just 17 total minutes in the postseason.\n\nWithout that plus spacing around him, Haliburton has not been as effective as a driver.\n\nMORE: Nuggets have no answers for Timberwolves' size, defense and Anthony Edwards\n\nIf Haliburton's calf issues weren't bad enough, he's also been going through back spasms that have clearly hampered his mobility. He was listed as questionable for Game 1 with the injury, which started in the Pacers' first-round series with the Bucks.\n\nHaliburton doesn't have the same quickness on his drives. He couldn't even manage to get by center Isaiah Hartenstein on switches in the first quarter.\n\nHaliburton took a leap at the beginning of the year because he became a bigger threat to score. When teams had to respect his shot, it opened up his brilliant passing even more. He is no longer that threat, both because of that dip in pull-up 3-point percentage and his lack of burst.\n\nThe Knicks have also done a great job of denying Haliburton the ball. Donte DiVincenzo has been in his shirt, preventing him from using screens and blowing up the plays that the Pacers have tried to run. Josh Hart has done a similarly admirable job.\n\nMORE: Myles Turner's controversial moving screen leads Knicks to Game 1 win\n\nWhile Haliburton's scoring has been hampered by all of the factors listed above, his court vision is still very much a factor.

He was out of character, he was rushing down the stretch of the ball game. They rattled him a little bit.\"\n\nHaliburton had his second-lowest number of attempts in a game this season, only attempting fewer in a January game when he exited in the first half because of an injury.\n\nThe Knicks' strategy involved attempts to keep the ball away from him at times, yet there were instances where Haliburton seemed hesitant to take shots when the opportunities arose. He notched eight assists - three below his NBA-leading season average of 11 per game - and added four steals.\n\nTyrese Haliburton vows to improve despite back-injury setback for Game 2 vs New York Knicks\n\nDuring a seven-minute media session, Haliburton reiterated that he would \"be better\" 13 times, clearly indicating a focus on preparing for Game 2.\n\nHowever, he is contending with back spasms and is still marked as questionable for Game 2, as he was at the start of the series.\n\nWhile he intends to play, the injury might be impacting him more than he admits. His aggression has notably decreased since his back, a recurring issue since high school, recently flared up.\n\nIn the past five games, two-thirds of Tyrese's shots have been from beyond the arc, and he has attempted an underwhelming seven free throws in his first seven playoff games.\n\nCoach Rick Carlisle acknowledged his role in helping Haliburton find his rhythm, but noted that the Pacers' offense was strong enough to secure a win in Game 1 despite their franchise player's struggles.\n\nHandling a subpar performance in a high-stakes loss and enduring the accompanying scrutiny is part of the journey for Haliburton, especially as a star player.

However, kicked balls cannot be ruled or challenged -- only fouls, goaltends and out-of-bounds calls. According to the report: \"Nesmith (IND) makes contact to the ball with his hand, not his foot. There is no replay trigger to review a kicked ball call.\"\n\nTurner's foul was reviewed after it was challenged by the Pacers. The league maintained the position of the officials.\n\n\"Replay review of the foul called on Turner (IND) pursuant to a coach's challenge was deemed unsuccessful,\" the report said. \"Turner turns into (Donte) DiVincenzo's (NYK) path and does not give him time and distance to change direction prior to the illegal contact.\"\n\nThere were three other decisions that the league acknowledged the officials got wrong, though it said two of those would have gone against the Pacers.\n\nThe report says Turner should have been called for defensive three seconds with 1:19 to go in the fourth quarter and it says that after the illegal screen that was called, Turner should have been called for another illegal screen on DiVincenzo. That screen came in the backcourt after a made free throw by the Knicks' Jalen Brunson with 10.7 seconds to go. That screen knocked DiVincenzo off his feet and sprung Haliburton to get free down the court. Haliburton stopped to try to pass near the rim and Knicks guard Josh Hart deflected the ball and the Knicks picked it up for a steal. The report determined that no foul should have been called there.\n\nThe report also ruled, however, that DiVincenzo should have been called for an illegal screen on Nesmith just before the kicked ball call on Nesmith.

That makes me extremely tired.\"", "body": "The Knicks enjoyed a happy Tuesday following their Monday triumph over Indiana to kick off the second-round series and put up an early 1-0 lead.\n\nBoth squads came back to their labs to get a few reps ahead of Wednesday's Game 2 and we could hear from a few dudes fighting out of both sides of the court.\n\nHere are some quotes we could snatch from the protagonists of this ECSF in the past few hours.\n\nOn the challenge of stopping Tyrese Haliburton...\n\n\"Haliburton -- I say this all the time -- he's an offense unto himself. And then when you throw in Nembhard and McConnell, that's a lot in terms of their versatility, but he's pushing tempo the whole time, so he's impacting the game in a lot of different ways. And if you leave him open, he's gonna make, and if you're slow to pick him up, he can make a read, so sometimes they miss good shots and you're fortunate. So we know we're gonna have to do a lot better.\"\n\nOn Jalen Brunson leading the Knicks...\n\n\"It's the impact that it's having on us. They're not empty stats. They're stats that are impacting winning.\"\n\nOn Josh Hart's conditioning...\n\n\"I told him playing for Team USA would be beneficial. So he came into camp in great shape.\"\n\nOn Tom Thibodeau's minute distribution and playing full games without sitting...\n\n\"Man, Thibs is giving me s -- . He loves to give me s -- for no reason. I haven't done anything to him but just play hard.\"\n\nOn his steady complaining about whatever Thibs does...\n\n\"My wife arguing with me. That makes me extremely tired.\"\n\nOn Donte DiVincenzo's skill set and defensive chops...\n\n\"He's someone who is athletic, has the quickness, the speed, physicality, the height to get over screens. He [blows up] dribble hand-offs, contests shots. If we need to switch, he's able to guard some of those bigger guys. He's someone that, like I said, he wants those matchups. He wants to guard the best -- the other team's best guards. We need him every game. I think that really, those tough defensive assignments really get him going on the offensive side.\"\n\nOn how the Knicks were able to defend Haliburton...\n\n\"I mean just being on a string. I think we can still do a lot better. But I think the biggest thing is just communication. And I think we have a lot of guys that sacrifice and play team defense.\"\n\nOn slowing Haliburton's production while being his main defender in Game 1...\n\n\"Yeah, just being aggressive, not letting him kinda dictate what we're gonna do. Just try to make it as difficult as possible. He's an All-Star for a reason, and he's gonna make adjustments. He's scanning the defense, reading, so just trying to not let him have as much time to scan the defense, survey what he wants to do. But like I said, you can't stop a player like him. He's gonna make adjustments going into the next game. We have to be ready.\"\n\nOn Brunson's breakout season and even-better playoffs...\n\n\"He's been doing this ever since we moved in together in college. It's the preparation mixed with the opportunity. The opportunity presents itself to him, and he takes full advantage of it.\"\n\n\"He studies the game, he knows how teams are going to adjust, and he continues to make adjustments himself. He finds different ways to be successful. He's always had this. It's just now, you guys are seeing it on this stage.\"\n\nOn joining a few legends of the game, including Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Jerry West, and Bernard King among others after his postseason exploits...\n\n\"Very honored to be a part of that group. But (feeling) nothing right now, really.\"\n\nOn falling way short of expectations in Game 1...\n\n\"I erred on the side of playmaking, and that wasn't the right decision for me.\"\n\nOn blaming his bad outing on himself and not the impressive Knicks' defensive effort...\n\n\"They're a good defensive team, but honestly, I look at it as a Tyrese issue more than a Knicks issue, so I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nOn not being worried about going down to start the second-down series against New York...\n\n\"I understand that we have an opportunity to get another one and go home 1-1, so I'm not hitting a panic button or alarm or anything. Just as a competitor, what more could you ask for than playing in the playoffs? Playing in Madison Square Garden, there's nothing like it. So I'm embracing all of it and enjoying every second of it.\"\n\nOn the Knicks defensive game and Tom Thibodeau's playbook...\n\n\"I don't want to take away from what they do defensively. They're a really good defensive team with a lot of different weapons and we all know Thibs is one of the best defensive minds for the last decade plus, so it's adjustments that I have to make and we have to make as a group and we will [in Game 2].\"\n\nOn having to improve if he wants to make this a series instead of a sweep by the Knicks...\n\n\"I have to be more aggressive, be myself. I just felt like even in Game 1 of the last series [against Milwaukee], I wasn't myself, just lack of aggression, my energy was and everything was off [Monday], so I'll be better in Game 2.\"\n\nOn Tyrese Haliburton going through some back issues...\n\n\"At this time of year everybody's got something going and he's working at it, doing everything he can to keep himself feeling as good as possible. I'm confident he'll play, but it's a concern.\"\n\nOn Jalen Brunson's position in Knicks' lore...\n\n\"Jalen is a great player and I'm happy for his success. I'm happy for the success of the New York Knicks. But I try not to get involved in all that. 'Whose better? Whose this? Is it myself? Is it Clyde? Is it Willis [Reed]?'\"\n\nOn the greatest Knick of all time (in reply to Ewing's comment)...\n\n\"It's you. I watched those guys and they're great and I loved them growing up and they're heroes of mine, but it's you.\"", "source": {"uri": "postingandtoasting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Posting and Toasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "antonio_losada@postingandtoasting.com", "name": "Antonio Losada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernard King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JR1sriCGJTPDb5Poozw6X7Kojg=/0x205:2459x1435/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25438410/2151934111.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWednesday was a big party for the New York Knicks, their fans, and even their former players.\n\nThe Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers in Game 2 of their second-round playoff series at Madison Square Garden. They erased a double-digit halftime deficit to win 130-121 and take a 2-0 lead in the series.\n\nThe game was also notable for the significant number of Knicks alums who were in attendance. Ten of them posed for an incredible group picture that was posted by the Knicks to their social media pages. Take a look.\n\nFrom left to right, that is Steve Novak, Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell, Stephon Marbury, Tim Thomas, Walt Frazier, Bernard King, Amar'e Stoudemire, John Starks, and Gerald Wilkins.\n\nWhile the iconic Frazier is the only one there with a championship ring (from 1970 and 1973, which are the two most recent Knicks titles to date), that is still a lot of talent in one photo. There are All-Star selections, All-NBA teams, All-Defensive nods, scoring titles, and more represented in that shot, all of whom played for the Knicks at one point in their respective careers.\n\nThe Knicks are famous for having plenty of alums (also including the likes of Patrick Ewing, Carmelo Anthony, and others) sitting at their games as well as A-list celebrities. While the fanfare has already caused some drama with opponents this postseason, real hoops heads had to have loved that group picture at Wednesday's game.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrell_Sprewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latrell Sprewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Houston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allan Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walt Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_King", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernard King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar'e_Stoudemire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amar'e Stoudemire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephon_Marbury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephon Marbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Novak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Novak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Wilkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Wilkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/knicks-court.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Turner didn't like the offensive foul called against him with 12.1 seconds left in their first-round series opener against the New York Knicks on Monday, and he strongly disagreed with the kicked ball violation called against Indiana wing Aaron Nesmith 40 seconds earlier.\n\n\"We're all looking forward to that coming out,\" Turner said. About the offensive foul, he said, \"In my experience in this league, I think it's the best when the players decide the outcome of the game. I think it's unfortunate it happened. We reviewed it and they still called it illegal screen, but it's the playoffs, man. I feel like [Donte] DiVincenzo did a good job of selling it.\" About the kick ball, he said, \"That was not a kick ball. You can clearly see on the replay.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Turner did not want to blame the officiating for the Pacers' Game 1 121-117 loss at Madison Square Garden. While he clearly had grievances, he also said that \"we have to take accountability as well.\" Emotions were still fresh, he said, but \"you can't leave the game to be decided by the refs.\"\n\nThe best way to avoid a late-game officiating controversy is always to have a lead big enough that a couple of calls can't erase it. Turner said he told his teammates in the locker room that they need to learn from the loss and move on.\n\n\"We have a very young team, and my speech to them after the game was telling them, like what I just told y'all, you can't rely on the refs at the end of the game,\" Turner said. \"Especially in this building. You know, Game 1 on the road, it's kind of a tough position to put ourselves in. But we take on the chin, and we just get ready for Game 2. That's all you can do. The best thing about this is we play every other day. So we make our adjustments, get ready to go on Wednesday and don't look too much into the two minute report. It just is what it is. I just think that there's going to be some glaring things in it.\"\n\nTurner was clearly of two minds. And while Indiana was not pleased with the way the game ended, nobody went on a scorched-earth tirade.\n\nAsked about the crunch-time call that went against him, Nesmith said, \"It wasn't a kick ball, you can clearly see it. But it is what it is.\"\n\nAsked about Turner's foul, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said, \"I don't want to talk about the officiating. We're not expecting to get calls in here. It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't. So that's just the way it goes. I mean, we challenged it, they reviewed it, they had a bunch of people in New Jersey that agreed with 'em.\"\n\nCarlisle said he rewatched the last four minutes before his press conference and \"couldn't see for sure\" whether or not the kicked ball violation was correctly called. He said that Nesmith's \"leg moved a little bit, so they assumed it was a kick,\" but Nesmith had told him the ball hit his hand, not his foot.\n\nIn an interview with a pool reporter, crew chief Zach Zarba said that Nesmith was right. The call, which occurred with the game tied 115-115 and prevented an Indiana fast break, was incorrect. (Kicked ball violations cannot be challenged.)\n\n\"On the floor we felt that would be a kicked ball violation,\" Zarba said. \"Post-game review did show that it hit the defender's hand, which would be legal.\"\n\nPacers guard T.J. McConnell had no interest in discussing what Turner described as \"two controversial calls.\" Informed that Turner had said that the team was looking forward to the Last Two Minute Report, McConnell said, \"We can't worry about the officiating. They're just trying to do their job, and there were many plays that we could have made where it didn't even come down to that, so that's the stuff we've got to focus on.\"\n\nInformed that Zarba had said the kicked ball violation was legal, and asked how the final 52 seconds might have been different if it was officiated correctly in the moment, McConnell said he wasn't sure, then repeated himself: \"There were plays that we could have made where it doesn't even come down to that. So, you know, unfortunate, but we gotta move on and fix things that we didn't do well.\"\n\nThose things, in Carlisle's estimation, were defensive rebounding (the Knicks rebounded 56.3% of their own misses in the second half), fouls (New York shot 22 for 26 from the free throw line and) and taking care of the ball (Indiana star Tyrese Haliburton had live-ball turnovers on two consecutive possessions with less than four minutes remaining).\n\n\"There's so many events that are an NBA game,\" Carlisle said. \"I mean, there's always a sharp focus on the last minute, but there were things that happened with five or six minutes left that really hurt us.\" Carlisle referenced a defensive possession about halfway through the fourth quarter in which \"one of our guys took a wild run to try to gamble and steal the ball, and it turned into a four-point play for them.\" Nesmith was the offender -- he chased after Knicks big man Isaiah Hartenstein -- and his mistake was compounded when Josh Hart proceeded to get an and-1, miss the free throw, grab the rebound and make a layup.\n\nHeartbreaking as the loss may be, Carlisle framed it as a learning experience.\n\n\"This is great experience for our guys,\" he said. \"It comes at a cost. It's no fun. But we're gonna have to learn some things for Game 2.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_herbert@cbssports.com", "name": "James Herbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Zarba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Zarba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The Villanova alum's parents both played college sports at Temple University, where they first met.\n\nBrunson was taught the importance of discipline and dedication from a young age. Since he was a kid, his parents emphasized the quote, \"The magic is in the work,\" which became his mantra.\n\n\"They had it on the wall, in my mirror when I woke up,\" Brunson -- who is in his second season with the Knicks -- told ESPN of the words his parents instilled in him as a young athlete. \"They had it in my lunch bag for school. They just made sure I saw that quote.\"\n\nIt's no surprise the sixth-year point guard's passion for basketball is where it is today. \"He was relentless when he was little and he was very meticulous,\" Sandra told CBS Mornings of a young Brunson. \"Even when we didn't go to games, he would pack his bag.\"\n\nShe explained, \"We're talking a four-year-old packing a duffel... and he was like, 'Mom, I'm going to my game.'\" She laughed, \"And it would just be down the hall!\"\n\nRead on to learn more about Jalen Brunson's parents, Sandra and Rick Brunson.\n\nRelated: Knicks Star (and Possible All-Star) Jalen Brunson Has One Thing on His Mind: 'Win' (Exclusive)\n\nRick is currently an assistant coach for the New York Knicks, where he works alongside his son Brunson. Prior to being hired with the team in June 2022, he coached various teams in the NBA.\n\nFrom January to April 2007, Rick was an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets before spending a couple of years coaching in the NCAA. In September 2010, he returned to the NBA as an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls. He also spent time assistant coaching the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nRick has coached Brunson his entire life, though he now does so on a professional level. CBS Mornings asked the Knicks star if it was hard differentiating his father's roles as \"dad\" and \"coach\" as a kid, to which he admitted, \"At first, yes.\"\n\nWhen Rick used to ask his son if basketball was what he \"wanted to do for a living\" when he grew up and Brunson told CBS Mornings, \"The answer was always 'yes.'\" He added, \"No matter what mood I was in.\"\n\nRelated: All About Caitlin Clark's Parents, Brent and Anne Nizzi-Clark\n\nRick played in the NBA for nearly a decade, a career that spanned several teams including the New York Knicks in 1998. He finished his ninth and final season with the Houston Rockets in 2006.\n\nDue to his time in the NBA, Rick's knowledge and experiences helped him shape his son into the athlete that he is today. Brunson said his dad would ask him if basketball was what he \"wanted to do for a living\" as early as the seventh grade.\n\nWhen speaking the CBS Mornings, Brunson explained the analogy his father would use when training him in the sport as a kid. \"He also always used to say, 'If a teacher gave you a study guide for a test, you'd take the study guide, prepare and take the test,'\" Brunson recalled. \"'Well I am the study guide. I have taken the test. You going to listen to me or not?'\" he continued.\n\nBrunson admitted his father's thought process \"makes sense\" now -- but as a kid, he said he was \"annoyed that he's right all the time.\" He added, \"But he's right.\"\n\nSandra was a student athlete at Temple University and played for the school's volleyball team. According to the New York Basketball X account, her college roommate was Kobe Bryant's sister.\n\nBrunson has inherited his parents' athletic genes and voiced his appreciation for them in a May 2020 interview. \"Thank you for my athletic ability because without you I wouldn't be able to jump as high as I do,\" the basketball star told his mom.\n\n\"Obviously my dad handled the basketball portion of it, handled like the working out portion,\" Brunson added of Rick. \"But my mom handled, legit, everything else.\"\n\nHe explained, \"She was the general. She held me accountable for everything I did. If I was putting my mind to something I couldn't quit until it was done. She basically gave me that no-quit mentally.\"\n\nRick was sure to train Brunson physically, but also mentally as a kid as he strived to play in the NBA.\n\n\"I would say to Rick, 'I'm afraid he's not going to like basketball soon,\" Sandra told CBS Mornings. \"And it wasn't so much Rick pushing him. It was more so Rick trying to embed the discipline the disciple that it takes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rick said he \"never felt that\" he pushed his son too hard. \"I would always talk to him about how bad did he want this. 'How good do you want to be?' His answer... he wanted to be great,\" the NBA coach said.\n\nBrunson pointed out a few training methods he endured growing up. \"He made me work out in the hot, summer sun... with a weight vest on,\" he said of his dad's workouts. \"His motto was, 'If you could shoot here, you could shoot anywhere.' It was more mental than anything.'\"\n\nRelated: All About Marvin Harrison Jr.'s Parents, Dawne and Marvin Harrison\n\nBrunson may be a star pro athlete, but he makes time to give back to those in need. Sandra and the Knicks player co-founded the Second Round Foundation, a nonprofit that \"plants seeds to create equity for young people through education, sport and community.\"\n\nThe foundation's mission is to \"empower young people to determine their own success, regardless of background or circumstance,\" according to its website. Since its inception, the non-profit has launched various campaigns including the One Family program and its Jalen Brunson Patriot Wellness Initiative.\n\nSandra doubles as the Second Round Foundation's CFO. She is also the president of the Brunson-founded JMB1 Enterprises.\n\nBrunson knows how to differentiate Rick's roles of \"dad\" and \"coach.\" In a June 2023 NBA interview, the Knicks player revealed the \"most important thing\" he's learned about his father.\n\n\"He's the most loving, caring father that I could ever ask for me and my sister -- but when he's a coach, he's a hard-nose coach. He wants the best put of me, he's going to push me,\" Brunson explained. \"He's going to keep pushing me because he knows I want to be the best that I could be.\"\n\nThe athlete added, \"That's the most important thing. Once I learned that, life became a lot easier and I began working even harder.\"\n\nSandra and Brunson share a close mother-son relationship. The basketball player opened up about their special bond during a May 2020 interview.\n\n\"She is like my best friend, she is my best friend, 100 percent,\" Brunson said of Sandra. Meanwhile, Sandra described her bond with Brunson as \"unbreakable and a blessing.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Brunson thanked Sandra for everything she's done for him to date. \"Thank you for sacrificing pretty much everything for myself and my sister,\" he said.\n\n\"I really do thank you for loving me every single day and being there every single day and allowing me to annoy you every day that I can,\" he continued. \"I truly love you with all my heart.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Mornings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS Mornings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriot League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PPEfQmt7mBE92gnKpsaiBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/a6f50737131f769a4dd3f7a1142d1373", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-01-", "dateEnd": "2007-04-", "textStart": 1726, "textEnd": 1747}, {"amb": false, "date": "1996-08-31", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 142}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-09-", "textStart": 1860, "textEnd": 1874}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 3796, "textEnd": 3804, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

It doesn't help that -- now in year three -- he's never averaged more than 17 minutes per game, but the bouncy 22-year-old is playing an impactful role right now in the Playoffs for the Indiana Pacers.\n\nAlthough it came in a 130-121 Game 2 loss to the New York Knicks on Wednesday night, Jackson was a known presence on defense in all 14 minutes he was on the floor. He finished with a stat line of five points, four rebounds, one assist, and one block, but he made all of his stats count and was a deterrent in the paint on the defensive end of the floor. His +11 in the box score was the second-highest among his teammates despite playing the fewest amount of minutes.\n\nJackson's lone block came early in the fourth quarter with his team down 99-95. The lanky 6-foot-9 big man snuck up behind Knicks' forward Precious Achiuwa and smacked a shot attempt into the crowd.\n\nJackson has been in and out of the Pacers rotation all season long, but over the last few games, head coach Rick Carlisle has given him a longer leash. In the final two games in the previous series against the Milwaukee Bucks and the first two of the series against the Pacers, Jackson has averaged 5.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, and one block in 11.8 minutes per outing on 61.5 percent shooting. His playing time has increased in each game.\n\nGranted, Jackson's offensive game is limited to shots at the rim, but his defense, length, and athleticism have been huge for the Pacers as of late. He's embraced his role. Unfortunately, it hasn't resulted in wins against the Knicks. That could change soon though as the series shifts to Indianapolis for Games 3 and 4.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_geoghegan@on3.com", "name": "Zack Geoghegan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Jackson_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Jackson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Science_Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Science Fiction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/09093620/bbnba-isaiah-jackson-making-plays-pacers.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Calls clearly favored New York throughout the series, and at the end, Philadelphia couldn't do anything but leave their fate to the fishy hands of the officials.\n\nNow, it seems like the madness won't be stopping anytime soon.\n\nJoel Embiid's cryptic post proves the 76ers were right all along\n\nFollowing New York's narrow Game 1 win over Indiana a few days back, Joel Embiid, clearly uncoincidentally, went on to indirectly express an oddly familiar feeling on social media.\n\nIn all likelihood, Embiid was probably referring to the questionable kicked ball violation called on Indiana when it was subsequently revealed that the officials made a wrong call on Pacers wing Aaron Nesmith. The Knicks ultimately survived the Pacers in regulation by just four points, but the controversial sequence once again brought up the consistent patterns of officiating since the 76ers were the ones on the opposing side of the Knicks.\n\nFast forward to Game 2, and the Pacers again felt that they got the short end of the stick when it came to the officiating. Alas, Indiana's side will reportedly plead to the league about the matter, even specifying the plays which they claimed were rued by missed calls. The number? 78 staggering missed calls averred by the Pacers through only a couple of games.\n\nClearly, the recurring one-sided officiating favoring New York has been pretty apparent since their bout with the Philadelphia 76ers.

Eight times before, hockey and basketball teams from one city playing in the same building have gone to their respective finals since the NBA was founded in 1946. But never have both league's champions emerged from the same city.\n\nThere are four chances right now for that to happen as the second round of the NHL and NBA playoffs unwind, in New York, Denver, Dallas and Boston. Those are four of the biggest markets in the country with some of the highest-valued and best-run teams.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\nIn New York, for example, the Rangers -- leading the Carolina Hurricanes 2-0 in their second-round series -- are valued by Sportico at $2.45 billion, second in the NHL behind the Toronto Maple Leafs, who have already been eliminated. The Rangers' revenue of $295 million is third in the NHL.\n\nThe Knicks, their Madison Square Garden counterparts, lead the Indiana Pacers 2-0 in the second round after beating the Pacers 130-121 in Game 2 Wednesday night. They're worth $7.43 billion, second behind the Golden State Warriors, who didn't survive the play-in round. The Knicks' revenue was $536 million, also third in the NBA.\n\nThat's with selling out every game in the same building -- the Knicks averaged 19,728 this past regular season; the Rangers 18,006, playing to 100% capacity.\n\nDespite disparities in the value of tickets and marketing of the two leagues, owner James Dolan is hauling in almost a billion dollars in revenue running the two teams. That's found its way on to the court and the ice.\n\n\"From a fan's perspective, all you can ask an owner to do is spend money, and [Dolan's] done that,\" Luis Cruz, a native New Yorker who has been rooting for the Knicks for more than 20 years, said last week as the Knicks vanquished the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round.\n\nBut the fact is, money spent hasn't produced titles. Both teams have only won three times in the current edition of the Garden, which opened in February 1968 and was recently totally renovated. Inside, the only familiar sight is the multicolored roof.\n\nThe Rangers have won the Stanley Cup only once since 1940, in 1994; they lost to the Los Angeles Kings in the final in 2014. The Knicks won NBA titles in 1970 and 1973, but haven't been back since losing to the Spurs in 1999. The two teams went to the finals in 1972 and 1994; both lost in '72 and only the Rangers won it all in 1994, defeating Vancouver at the Garden.\n\nThe week of June 12-17, 1994, is still one of the most memorable weeks in Garden playoff history, dominated by three Knicks games against the Rockets and the Rangers' clincher over Vancouver. All of this occurred as the Los Angeles police uncovered the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, and another man.\n\nOn June 12, the murders happened in Los Angeles. That same day, the Rockets defeated the Knicks in Game 3. On June 14, the Rangers beat the Canucks, 3-2, in Game 7 to to clinch the Stanley Cup, with the final faceoff coming just to the right of goalie Mike Richter at the final buzzer. On June 15, the Knicks won Game 4.\n\nOn June 17, the Rangers held their victory parade through the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan. Later that day, Simpson was charged with the murders, and the infamous white Bronco chase unfolded. As the Knicks and Rockets vied to snap a 2-2 tie in the best-of-seven series, national television cameras began to focus on Simpson's freeway chase 3,000 miles away. This was long before handheld video devices, so fans watching the Knicks at the Garden were left with staying in their seats to watch the game or heading to the concession stands to observe the NBC broadcast.\n\n\"NBC was in a unique position,\" Bob Costas, who called the Knicks game, recalled. \"We'd split the screen showing [the action] in the Garden on one side, and the Bronco making its way slowly down the 405 on the other side. It was surreal, to put it mildly.\"\n\nSimpson, who died of prostate cancer last month, eventually turned himself in, and the Knicks won the game, sending the series back to Houston, where they narrowly lost Games 6 and 7.\n\nThirty years later, the Knicks and Rangers have another chance to go where no other NBA and NHL teams have gone before: win dual titles in the same season while sharing the same building.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penske_Media_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penske Media Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James L.

One such call was a kicked ball against Aaron Nesmith, where the Pacers should have gained possession but couldn't challenge due to rules. The Knicks retained possession, leading to a crucial three-pointer by Donte DiVincenzo.\n\nThe Pacers had a chance for a final shot, but an illegal screen call against Myles Turner, prompted by DiVincenzo's acting, shifted the momentum.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle refrained from commenting on the officiating, acknowledging the game's ups and downs.\n\nSocial media erupted with claims of rigging, with fans expressing frustration over perceived bias towards the Knicks in the game's closing minutes. Despite the controversy, debates online varied, reflecting fans' diverse opinions and loyalties.\n\nWhile referees are fallible, and biases toward home teams have been noted, accusations of game-fixing lack concrete evidence.

The Villanova alum's parents both played college sports at Temple University, where they first met.\n\nBrunson was taught the importance of discipline and dedication from a young age. Since he was a kid, his parents emphasized the quote, \"The magic is in the work,\" which became his mantra.\n\n\"They had it on the wall, in my mirror when I woke up,\" Brunson -- who is in his second season with the Knicks -- told ESPN of the words his parents instilled in him as a young athlete. \"They had it in my lunch bag for school. They just made sure I saw that quote.\"\n\nIt's no surprise the sixth-year point guard's passion for basketball is where it is today. \"He was relentless when he was little and he was very meticulous,\" Sandra told CBS Mornings of a young Brunson. \"Even when we didn't go to games, he would pack his bag.\"\n\nShe explained, \"We're talking a four-year-old packing a duffel... and he was like, 'Mom, I'm going to my game.'\" She laughed, \"And it would just be down the hall!\"\n\nRead on to learn more about Jalen Brunson's parents, Sandra and Rick Brunson.\n\nRick is currently an assistant coach for the New York Knicks, where he works alongside his son Brunson. Prior to being hired with the team in June 2022, he coached various teams in the NBA.\n\nFrom January to April 2007, Rick was an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets before spending a couple of years coaching in the NCAA. In September 2010, he returned to the NBA as an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls. He also spent time assistant coaching the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nRick has coached Brunson his entire life, though he now does so on a professional level. CBS Mornings asked the Knicks star if it was hard differentiating his father's roles as \"dad\" and \"coach\" as a kid, to which he admitted, \"At first, yes.\"\n\nWhen Rick used to ask his son if basketball was what he \"wanted to do for a living\" when he grew up and Brunson told CBS Mornings, \"The answer was always 'yes.'\" He added, \"No matter what mood I was in.\"\n\nRick played in the NBA for nearly a decade, a career that spanned several teams including the New York Knicks in 1998. He finished his ninth and final season with the Houston Rockets in 2006.\n\nDue to his time in the NBA, Rick's knowledge and experiences helped him shape his son into the athlete that he is today. Brunson said his dad would ask him if basketball was what he \"wanted to do for a living\" as early as the seventh grade.\n\nWhen speaking the CBS Mornings, Brunson explained the analogy his father would use when training him in the sport as a kid. \"He also always used to say, 'If a teacher gave you a study guide for a test, you'd take the study guide, prepare and take the test,'\" Brunson recalled. \"'Well I am the study guide. I have taken the test. You going to listen to me or not?'\" he continued.\n\nBrunson admitted his father's thought process \"makes sense\" now -- but as a kid, he said he was \"annoyed that he's right all the time.\" He added, \"But he's right.\"\n\nSandra was a student athlete at Temple University and played for the school's volleyball team. According to the New York Basketball X account, her college roommate was Kobe Bryant's sister.\n\nBrunson has inherited his parents' athletic genes and voiced his appreciation for them in a May 2020 interview. \"Thank you for my athletic ability because without you I wouldn't be able to jump as high as I do,\" the basketball star told his mom.\n\n\"Obviously my dad handled the basketball portion of it, handled like the working out portion,\" Brunson added of Rick. \"But my mom handled, legit, everything else.\"\n\nHe explained, \"She was the general. She held me accountable for everything I did. If I was putting my mind to something I couldn't quit until it was done. She basically gave me that no-quit mentally.\"\n\nRick was sure to train Brunson physically, but also mentally as a kid as he strived to play in the NBA.\n\n\"I would say to Rick, 'I'm afraid he's not going to like basketball soon,\" Sandra told CBS Mornings. \"And it wasn't so much Rick pushing him. It was more so Rick trying to embed the discipline the disciple that it takes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rick said he \"never felt that\" he pushed his son too hard. \"I would always talk to him about how bad did he want this. 'How good do you want to be?' His answer... he wanted to be great,\" the NBA coach said.\n\nBrunson pointed out a few training methods he endured growing up. \"He made me work out in the hot, summer sun... with a weight vest on,\" he said of his dad's workouts. \"His motto was, 'If you could shoot here, you could shoot anywhere.' It was more mental than anything.'\"\n\nBrunson may be a star pro athlete, but he makes time to give back to those in need. Sandra and the Knicks player co-founded the Second Round Foundation, a nonprofit that \"plants seeds to create equity for young people through education, sport and community.\"\n\nThe foundation's mission is to \"empower young people to determine their own success, regardless of background or circumstance,\" according to its website. Since its inception, the non-profit has launched various campaigns including the One Family program and its Jalen Brunson Patriot Wellness Initiative.\n\nSandra doubles as the Second Round Foundation's CFO. She is also the president of the Brunson-founded JMB1 Enterprises.\n\nBrunson knows how to differentiate Rick's roles of \"dad\" and \"coach.\" In a June 2023 NBA interview, the Knicks player revealed the \"most important thing\" he's learned about his father.\n\n\"He's the most loving, caring father that I could ever ask for me and my sister -- but when he's a coach, he's a hard-nose coach. He wants the best put of me, he's going to push me,\" Brunson explained. \"He's going to keep pushing me because he knows I want to be the best that I could be.\"\n\nThe athlete added, \"That's the most important thing. Once I learned that, life became a lot easier and I began working even harder.\"\n\nSandra and Brunson share a close mother-son relationship. The basketball player opened up about their special bond during a May 2020 interview.\n\n\"She is like my best friend, she is my best friend, 100 percent,\" Brunson said of Sandra. Meanwhile, Sandra described her bond with Brunson as \"unbreakable and a blessing.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Brunson thanked Sandra for everything she's done for him to date. \"Thank you for sacrificing pretty much everything for myself and my sister,\" he said.\n\n\"I really do thank you for loving me every single day and being there every single day and allowing me to annoy you every day that I can,\" he continued. \"I truly love you with all my heart.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Mornings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS Mornings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriot League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/QRJd1CsW0sTyXf1WECfxSfq9vVA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jalen-brunson-parents-050824-2-4d8f46597ae841309558d043349ac45b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-01-", "dateEnd": "2007-04-", "textStart": 1500, "textEnd": 1521}, {"amb": false, "date": "1996-08-31", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 21}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-09-", "textStart": 1634, "textEnd": 1648}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 3498, "textEnd": 3506, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

During the NBA In-Season Tournament, we were seeing totals of 11.5 and 12.5 -- a prop that's now down to 8.5, albeit with heavy juice on the Over.\n\nHe's ailing with a back injury and while he is still playing, it's affecting his ability to score. For the Indiana Pacers to have any hope in this series, they need him to generate offense, and while he may not be doing that himself, he can still be extremely effective as a playmaker. In Game 1, he only scored six points but had eight assists on 15 potential assists.\n\nThe New York Knicks don't have a point-of-attack defender who can lock up Haliburton even if he is a step slower with the back injury. Donte DiVincenzo is the primary defender on Haliburton and he's an average defender at best.\n\nThe strength of the Knicks' defense is on the interior and on the wings; it's why Tyrese Maxey had such big games against them as well.

Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, Patrick Ewing and John Starks aren't wearing the jerseys anymore, but orange and blue vs. blue and gold feels familiar.\n\nAnd the overwhelming majority of Monday's Game 1 -- a 121-117 Knicks win -- honored the tradition.\n\nBut with just over 12 seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Pacers down one, officials took the game out of the players' hands.\n\nWith Tyrese Haliburton breaking slightly to the left from halfcourt and his defender, Donte DiVincenzo, five feet off him, Myles Turner set a run-of-the-mill screen outside the three-point line. DiVincenzo hit the deck like he ran into a 2x4, rather than the kind of screen you see dozens of times every game.\n\nThe sideline ref took the bait, called a moving screen and gave the ball back to the Knicks.\n\nThe play was even reviewed. The call was upheld. It was unquestionably more of a flop than a moving screen, but the ball was headed the other way. And to make matters worse, Andrew Nembhard was called for an away-from-the-play foul before the ball was inbounded again. Brunson sank that free throw, then nailed two more after he was fouled to stop the clock on the next possession.\n\nAt that point, the game was essentially over. And the score held steady at 121-117.\n\nThat Pacers possession, with 12 seconds to go, could've been electric. Indiana likely would've held for the last shot. A game-winner would've been a heck of a way to start the series. But we'll never know how that possession would've played out, thanks to a routine play randomly being called differently than it typically is.\n\nAnd therein lies perhaps the biggest issue with the officiating adjustment. On balance, the more physical game is a better watch. It beats the constant foul grifting and other trickery that'd become so common in the first half of the season.\n\nBut it's turned a lot of games into rugby matches sporadically interrupted by whistles, especially in the playoffs. Players have naturally adapted to the rougher game, so everybody is understandably confused when those calls come. For several possessions in a row, there's uncalled contact on every touch. Then, suddenly, something like the moving screen call on Turner happens.\n\nYou can see it in just about every game right now, but it was especially bad in Madison Square Garden on Monday.\n\nIt wasn't just the call. It was the situation in which it was made.\n\nRick Carlisle took a slightly different approach, saying they didn't expect calls in MSG but also added, \"It would be nice if they laid off that one, but they didn't.\"\n\nNow, we await the last two-minute report. Will they admit a mistake or echo the in-game crew's explanation about Turner moving?\n\nEither way, it's worth mentioning that the league's officials have an impossible task. These are the biggest, fastest athletes in the world. Just about every possession features a bang-bang play that could draw some kind of reaction from the refs, especially since players have started playing more physically.\n\nAnd again, if the alternative is to go back to a bunch of unwarranted foul calls, unimpeded paths to the rim and exorbitant point totals, the current approach is the preferable one.\n\nBut if the NBA is committed to the adjustments it made next season, the officials will have to find the balance that eliminates moments like Monday's moving screen.\n\nRelative to the way games have been played for months, it was nothing.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_bailey@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Andy Bailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rik_Smits", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rik Smits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715051566/thd6pnrs0rknhzpdmxbe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

Making some big roster changes throughout the year, New York attempted to build a team capable of going deep in the playoffs, and they are now two wins away from the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWhile New York deserves a lot of credit for what they have been able to do this postseason, some feel the Knicks get a favorable whistle. One NBA figure who expressed this opinion recently was former Golden State Warriors champion Nick Young.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see big market teams like the Knicks or Los Angeles Lakers receive this level of attention as it pertains to their whistle. While some stats can add validity to these claims, or in other scenarios disprove them, the discussion is often subjective when looking at particular plays in question. There are certainly instances of egregious misses by officials, but a lot of times the debates are about calls that could go either way.\n\nSo far this postseason, the Knicks are 5th in free-throw attempts per game, trailing the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Orlando Magic, and Philadelphia 76ers. The Mavericks are the only team in that group still alive, as Phoenix, Orlando, and Philadelphia all went home in round one.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Knicks are two wins away from eliminating the Indiana Pacers and advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nKlay Thompson Shares Strong Message Amid Contract Rumors\n\nSteve Kerr Reacts to Warriors Receiving Zero Championship Votes in GM Survey", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Young_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Young (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2630,h_1479,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_warriors/01hxf8sxhy9ajgz3a6p6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

He loves creating shots for his teammates, and he doesn't have to score 30-plus points to make his mark on a game. That said, his six points and six field goal attempts in Game 1 of the Indiana Pacers' second-round series against the New York Knicks on Monday were not enough.\n\nHaliburton needs to \"be more aggressive and be myself,\" the two-time All-Star said after the Pacers practiced at the National Basketball Players Association's Manhattan office on Tuesday. \"I just felt like, even Game 1 of the last series, I wasn't myself. Just lack of aggression, my energy was -- everything was off yesterday.\"\n\nWith about five minutes left in the third quarter at Madison Square Garden, Haliburton came off a hand-off from Myles Turner, took one dribble and missed a 3-pointer. He didn't take another shot for the remainder of Indiana's 121-117 loss, and he didn't take a free throw all night.\n\nWhile he had eight assists and had to deal with Knicks guard Donte DiVincenzo pressuring him on the ball and denying him off the ball, Haliburton did not get defensive about his approach. Haliburton credited the Knicks for being \"a really good defensive team with a lot of different weapons\" and described their coach, Tom Thibodeau, as \"one of the best defensive minds for the last decade-plus,\" but said his lack of production was on him.\n\n\"I look at it more as a Tyrese issue more than a Knicks issue,\" Haliburton said.\n\nRepeatedly, Haliburton said that he'll be better in Game 2 on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think that every player in the league who's a scorer and a high-usage guy, passes the ball a lot, it's a balance we need to find,\" he said. It's not easy, but obviously, I erred on the side of playmaking yesterday and that wasn't the right decision for me.\"\n\nHaliburton blamed himself for the controversial offensive foul called against Myles Turner with 52 seconds left, and for the botched pick-and-roll involving him and Turner that led directly to an OG Anunoby dunk with a bit more than three minutes on the clock.\n\n\"I think it's less about miscommunication with Myles and more on Tyrese,\" Haliburton said.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle, however, stressed that they're not looking for Haliburton to go into hero mode. It all \"starts with our defense,\" he said, and then they need to put pressure on New York in transition and with their movement and tempo in the halfcourt.\n\n\"When we get stops and rebounds, which are hard to come by in this series, we gotta get the ball moving, Carlisle said. \"And we gotta trust the pass. We're a unique team in that we really need each other. We don't have any one guy that can put the team on his back. Not Tyrese, not Pascal [Siakam], not anybody. That's one of the things that's made our team very special. But we have to understand there's a certain formula.\"\n\nCarlisle did allow that six field-goal attempts is too few for the face of the franchise. He also pointed out that Haliburton, who was listed as questionable with back spasms leading up to the opener, is not fully healthy.\n\n\"I gotta do a better job of getting him more shots,\" he said. \"I'll give you that. And look, he's playing through some stuff. He'll be on the injury report, questionable tomorrow, with the back thing. I'm confident he'll play, but he's playing through some stuff there, too. This is the second round of the playoffs, and this is hard. And you gotta embrace the difficulty of the whole thing.\"\n\nThe back issue is \"a factor\" and \"a concern,\" Carlisle said, but Haliburton is \"doing everything he can to keep himself feeling as good as possible.\"\n\nSiakam said Haliburton simply has to \"continue to be himself\" and, when New York is denying him, \"work harder to get the ball, be a screen setter.\" Haliburton \"doesn't have to be scoring,\" he said, as long as the 24-year-old is \"at his pace and playing fast\" and affecting the game in other ways.\n\n\"Ty's going to be Ty,\" Siakam said.\n\nHaliburton made it abundantly clear that he wasn't pleased with his performance, but he didn't exactly sound down in the dumps. Just a couple of weeks ago, he scored nine points on seven field goal attempts in the first playoff game of his career, and he's still playing. Postseason basketball is \"everything I've ever asked for,\" he said.\n\n\"The world ain't ending 'cause we lost one game,\" Haliburton said. \"Understanding we have an opportunity to get another one tomorrow and go home 1-1.

He did have eight assists, three less than his NBA-leading average of 11 per game during the regular season, and four steals.\n\n\"I erred on the side of playmaking...and that wasn't the right decision for me,\" Haliburton said Tuesday following the team's practice. \"I still got to be who I am, but yeah, I'll just be better tomorrow.\"\n\nIn speaking with the media for seven minutes, Haliburton said he'd \"be better\" on 13 different occasions. Clearly the theme of the preparation for Game 2. But Haliburton is dealing with back spasms and remains listed as questionable on the injury report for Game 2, as he was entering the series.

His aggression has noticeably been reduced since his back, which he's had occasional issues with since he was in high school, flared up recently.\n\n\"At this time of year everybody's got something going and he's working at it, doing everything he can to keep himself feeling as good as possible,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"I'm confident he'll play, but it's a concern.\"\n\nOver the last five games, two-thirds of Haliburton's attempts have been 3-pointers, and he's taken a total of seven free throws in seven playoff games. Carlisle said it was on him to help Haliburton get going but the Pacers offense was good enough to win Game 1 even with the team's franchise player struggling.\n\nThe challenge of dealing with a poor performance in a high-stakes loss and the scrutiny that comes with it as a star is part of the process for Haliburton.

Haliburton's performance may be impacted by a lingering back spasm injury. The Pacers will need Haliburton to return to form if they wish to continue their playoff success.\n\nTyrese Haliburton has been the main man for the Indiana Pacers this season, but he did not perform up to his role in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals. In that game against the New York Knicks, Haliburton put up only six points while taking only six shots, his second-lowest this season.\n\nHis subpar performance in the game, which the Pacers lost by a score of 121-117, sparked concern over Haliburton possibly possessing an injury. He is listed as questionable for Game 2 due to back spasms, and coach Rick Carlisle indicated that those spasms could be affecting his level of play.\n\n\"At this time of year everybody's got something going and he's working at it, doing everything he can to keep himself feeling as good as possible. I'm confident he'll play, but it's a concern.\"\n\nAdjusting to a New Role Haliburton has taken on a new playmaker role to accommodate his injury\n\nWhile Haliburton only recorded six points on six shots, he stated after the game that it was due to him attempting to take on more of a playmaker role, possibly due to a lingering injury. He did record eight assists and four steals in Game 1, but that did not make enough of an impact.\n\n\"I erred on the side of playmaking...and that wasn't the right decision for me. I still got to be who I am, but yeah, I'll just be better tomorrow.\" -- Tyrese Haliburton\n\nHaliburton has dealt with back issues on and off since high school, but they have apparently begun to pop up again at an inopportune time. The Pacers do possess one of the game's deepest benches, which scored 46 points in Game 1 alone (as opposed to the Knicks' three). But the reality is that if the Pacers want to win this series, they will need prime Haliburton.\n\nHaliburton's Numbers Are Down Haliburton's stats are down in the playoffs from the regular season\n\nThis year marks Haliburton's first taste at the postseason, a fitting conclusion to what has been a phenomenal breakout season. In the regular season, Haliburton averaged 20.1 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 10.9 assists per game, while shooting 47.7 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from the three point range.\n\nTyrese Haliburton - 2023-24 Splits\n\nCategory\n\nRegular Season\n\nPlayoffs\n\nPPG\n\n20.1\n\n14.6\n\nRPG\n\n3.9\n\n9.3\n\nAPG\n\n10.9\n\n9.1\n\nFG%\n\n47.7\n\n42.9\n\n3PT%\n\n36.4\n\n30.5\n\nBut in this year's postseason thus far, those averages have dropped to 14.6 points and 9.1 assists. His rebounds have actually gone up to 9.3, most likely due to his taking on the playmaker role. His shooting, though, has dropped significantly to 42.9 percent from the field and 30.5 percent from the three-point range.\n\n\"[This] is everything I've ever asked for.

On 13 separate occasions, Haliburton told the media he would \"be better\" in Game 2. Whether or not his injury persists will play a huge part in that, and the Pacers' success in this series.\n\nRelated Joe Mazzulla Gives Optimism on Kristaps Porzingis Injury Timeline Kristaps Porzingis suffered a soleus strain in Game 4 of Boston's first-round series versus Miami.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/haliburton-mixcollage-05-apr-2024-10-16-pm-8062.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 102, "relevance": 1}

Nuggets superstar big Nikola Jokic earned his third MVP award Wednesday. The votes for the prestigious hardware, including the 79 first-place votes Jokic received, are taken before the regular season and any spectacular performances after Game 82 don't count.\n\nThat means all of Brunson's incredible performances -- like his record-setting four consecutive 40-point games -- that could've swayed voters cant even be considered.\n\nThe star's head coach thinks that maybe the voting should begin after the postseason concludes.\n\n\"I think there's a time element to it. Is it MVP for the entire season, is it MVP for the regular season, but there's a number of deserving candidates and certainly we feel Jalen is deserving as well,\" Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau said before Wednesday's Game 2. \"So those things are tough and just like the All-Star selection, you hate to leave anyone off that's deserving. That's the reality of it.\n\n\"So I'd prefer to wait till everything was done so you can look at everything.\"\n\nBrunson, a first-time All-Star this season, finished fifth for the award behind Jokic, Oklahoma City's Shai-Gilgeous Alexander, Dallas' Luka Doncic and Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, respectively. The Knicks guard averaged 28.7 points, 6.7 assists and 3.6 rebounds while carrying the injury-riddled Knicks to the second seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nIf voting took place after the postseason, Brunson's first and second-round performance could've bolstered his case to at least finish as a finalist. The same could be said, however, for Gilgeous-Alexander and Doncic, who are both leading their squads in the second round of the postseason.\n\nMiami Heat president Pat Riley told reporters Monday that the NBA's current 65-game requirement for end-of-season awards \"sends a message that it's OK to sit when you're not 100 percent when no one in this league is 100 percent.\"\n\nPlayers who miss more than 17 games can't be considered for any end-of-season awards. Thibodeau gave his opinion on the current rule.\n\n\"I think they're trying to figure it out,\" the head coach said about the NBA decision-makers. \"We all want to see everyone play as many games as possible. I think the competition part of it is important.\n\n\"You want to look at it from the other side as well. You want to make good decisions. Protecting the players is important. I think looking at it in totality and figuring out 'OK what's best for the game.' I think we have to prioritize that too. There's a lot at stake for everybody.\"\n\nThibodeau repeatedly emphasized that his star guard wasn't getting enough free throws despite taking a beating during games. In the previous two postseason games entering Wednesday, Brunson shot 16 attempts in Game 6 of the first round and 14 in the Game 1 victory over the Pacers. Those are the most attempts from the charity stripe he's taken this postseason.\n\nHe shot 12 and 11 in Games 3 and 4 against Philadelphia, respectively. Other than that, he hadn't shot more than nine attempts from the line.\n\n\"I dont think so,\" Thibodeau said when asked if Brunson is now being officiated differently. \"When you look at the drives too, I think there's a reflection and and he's going to the basket quote a bit. So I think that's more a byproduct of that. He's very shifty. He puts the defense at a disadvantage. And he's getting fouled.

Meanwhile, his top-tier playmaking remained relatively consistent throughout the year, averaging 10.9 assists (league-high) on 2.3 turnovers. The real problem is the major drop-off in Haliburton's scoring in the NBA playoffs thus far, as he's averaging just 14.6 points while shooting 42.9% from the field and 30.5% from 3-point range.\n\nIf Haliburton isn't a player who rises to the occasion in the postseason, will that cause issues for the Pacers in future seasons?\n\nGame 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks is perhaps the greatest example, as Haliburton scored 6 points on 2-of-6 shooting in 36 minutes of action. The poor efficiency is not a problem when compared to the lack of shot attempts. Teammate T.J. McConnell outplayed Haliburton, finishing with 18 points and 3 steals on 56.3% shooting. It's worth noting this is the 24-year-old's first time in the postseason, leaving plenty of time to develop a knack for thriving on the biggest stage. On the other hand, most players who thrive in the playoffs hit the ground and make their presence felt running regardless of their experience.\n\nOftentimes, the best playoff performers shoot the ball at will. Haliburton has always been a pass-first player, but he's made an effort to be more aggressive on offense and seek out his own shot over the last year-and-a-half.\n\n\"They're a good defensive team, but honestly, I look at it as a Tyrese issue more than a Knicks issue, so I'll be better in Game 2,\" Haliburton said following Tuesday's practice. \"I think that every player in the league who's a scorer and a high-usage guy passes the ball a lot. It's a balance we all have to find. It's not easy, but obviously I erred on the side of playmaking this day and that wasn't the right decision for me, so I still got to be who I am.\"\n\nThe addition of forward Pascal Siakam was crucial to the Pacers and a key reason for their victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. In Game 2 of that series, he finished with 37 points, 11 rebounds, and 6 assists on 69.6% shooting. However, Siakam is set to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason, potentially leaving Indiana without a second star once again.\n\nNo team in recent memory has won a title without a star who thrives in the biggest moments at the helm of their rotation. In 2023, Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic filled that role for the Denver Nuggets. In 2022, the Golden State Warriors had Stephen Curry. In 2021, the Milwaukee Bucks had Giannis Antetokounmpo. In 2020, the Los Angeles Lakers had LeBron James. And so on.\n\nHaliburton will remain in Indiana for the foreseeable future after signing a five-year, $260 million contract extension in the 2023 offseason. The organization hopes that Haliburton will find his playoff form sooner than later, allowing the front office to build a championship-contending roster around him.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

It's the second straight game that Brunson's point total has been set that high, also holding a 37.5 point total ahead of the Knicks' Game 1 win on Monday.\n\nOf course, there's a good reason why Brunson's total is as high as it is. He joined rarified air with his 43-point performance on Monday, becoming just the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 40 points in four straight playoff games. He's the first player to do it since Michael Jordan in 1993, joining fellow Knicks star Bernard King in the process.\n\nJerry West's six-game streak of 40-plus points in a playoff game is the only streak longer than Brunson's at this point. Brunson to score at least 40 points is at +105 at DraftKings Sportsbook, an implied probability of roughly 49%.\n\nPrior to his historic scoring outburst, Brunson's point total typically hovered in the high 20s and low 30s. His point total at the start of the Knicks' opening-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers was at 31.5, but dropped to 29.5 in Game 3 after he scored just 46 total points in the first two games.\n\nBrunson's point total began to climb again following his 39-point performance in the Knicks' Game 3 loss to the 76ers in the first round, climbing back up to 31.5 for Game 4. Brunson's 47-point outing in Game 4 against the 76ers led to his point total reaching 33.5 for Game 5.\n\nIt remained at that number for Game 6 of that series.\n\nWith the streak, Brunson has gone over his point total in each of the last five games. Brunson has scored at least 38 points in 20 games this season and has hit the 40-point mark 15 times this year, including the playoffs.\n\nIt's unclear where Brunson's betting point total ranks in NBA history, but it is relatively uncommon to see a point total climb over 35. For instance, Luka Doncic has the next highest listed point total among all players in the upcoming games, holding a 31.5-point total for Game 2 of the Dallas Mavericks-Oklahoma City Thunder series.\n\nJoel Embiid had a few similarly high point totals earlier in the 2023-24 season.

Doncic expressed his happiness for his 2018 Draft classmate.\n\n\"Amazing. He's doing everything for them. I saw the game yesterday. He had a quiet 40. I didn't even know he had 40 until I looked it up. He gets to his spots whenever he wants. That's my guy. I'm really happy for him.\"\n\nBrunson and Doncic were very close friends after being drafted by the Mavericks together in 2018. That might be one of the greatest draft nights in Dallas history, but Brunson leaving the team after four seasons means that the Mavs never got to see Brunson the way he's playing now. At least they'll always have the 2022 Conference Finals run to reminisce over.\n\nJalen is averaging 36.6 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 8.6 assists in the 2024 Playoffs, a huge increase from his incredible regular season stats of 28.7 points and 6.7 assists.\n\nDoncic has always been regarded as the better player, but Brunson is outperforming him in the 2024 Playoffs, with Luka averaging 29.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 9.5 assists in the postseason.\n\nThese two have similar play-styles which explains why Brunson couldn't thrive as the secondary ball-handler behind Luka. Kyrie Irving is a better fit given his off-ball scoring ability while Brunson gets to run his own team instead of settling for second units or Luka injuries.\n\nLuka Doncic Knew Jalen Brunson Would Take A Leap\n\nDoncic is one of the smartest players in the NBA right now and he saw Brunson taking a massive leap during the 2022 NBA Playoffs given how he carried Dallas to the second round with Luka out injured for the first three games of that playoff run.\n\n\"I would say one game that really was impressive on that playoff run, we lose the first game against Utah, I don't play the first three games... That second game, I think he had like 45, something like that. It was a tough game, and we needed a win no matter what. That was really impressive. I was just on the bench watching like 'Wow, this guy's amazing.' But just starting the first time we got together, the way he worked out every day, coming back in the afternoon, it was just amazing to play with that.\"\n\nThe Knicks had notoriously sent scouts to watch that Mavs vs. Jazz series in 2022 to evaluate Brunson and Donovan Mitchell. They clearly saw what they liked and moved tons of salary to open up the space to offer Brunson a contract that Mark Cuban and the Mavericks chose not to match.\n\nThat decision might not haunt the team anymore as they're in the second round of the playoffs with Kyrie Irving in Brunson's old role, but Brunson's departure directly led to the Mavericks failing to make the 2023 Playoffs.\n\nIf the Doncic era in Dallas doesn't lead to championship success, the decision to let Brunson walk will always be brought up for the Mavericks.

Luka Doncic and Jalen Brunson teamed up in the 2021-22 season to lead the squad to a Western Conference Finals berth, where they lost to eventual champions, the Golden State Warriors.\n\nHowever, the franchise's plans were nipped in the bud after the then-25-year-old Brunson opted to sign with the New York Knicks in the following offseason, leaving Doncic alone to lead Dallas to an uncertain future and the organization wondering if it would regret not overpaying to retain the former second-round pick.\n\nThe Mavs ended up with a losing record in the 2022-23 campaign, while the Knicks reached the playoffs, where they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round. This year, Dallas bounced back, while Brunson became an MVP candidate.\n\nLuka Doncic is 'really happy' for Jalen Brunson\n\nDespite the aborted partnership, Doncic said he is \"really happy\" for his former teammate, who has been on a tear in the playoffs.\n\nThe Slovenian superstar must have been too busy to watch other postseason games. After all, the Mavs needed six games to eliminate the LA Clippers in the first round, and he has been dealing with a concerning knee injury, which could end up impacting his performance in the conference semifinals against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nOn the other side of the conference, Brunson has put up four straight 40-point performances while averaging 8.5 assists per game. As a result, the Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round and are up 1-0 against the Indiana Pacers in their current series. He has also risen to third in our most recent NBA MVP power rankings, the highest among all Eastern Conference players.\n\nBrunson's superstar turn may have had some people wondering, though, how things would have turned out had he chosen to re-sign with the Mavericks in 2022. Having two ball-dominant players hasn't exactly been a recipe for success in the league, although the stars showed no problems co-existing before parting ways.\n\nIn addition, had Brunson not moved to greener pasture, Dallas likely wouldn't have gotten Kyrie Irving last year.\n\nWhether which of the two scoring guards is better at this point in their careers is up for debate, but there is no denying how impressive the chemistry between Irving and Doncic has been. The duo has proven plenty of pundits wrong, including Shaquille O'Neal, whose painfully wrong take about the Mavs stars having trouble working well together aged poorly.\n\nWhile it would have been nice to see Doncic and Brunson grow together, Irving has more than made up for the latter's absence.\n\nFor all the latest on Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks, stay tuned with us.", "source": {"uri": "thesmokingcuban.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Smoking Cuban"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3384,h_1903,x_0,y_1055/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/83/01hxce3xv2erdxp2yx1x.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 95, "relevance": 1}

The last NBA player to put up those scoring numbers? Michael Jordan. Bernard King and Jerry West have also done it, but that's it.\n\nJordan, West and King. Not bad company for Brunson, who night after night is giving a starving Knick fan base another reason to believe and trust in this team.\n\nOne of the more remarkable aspects of Brunson's scoring run? He's been remarkably efficient.\n\nAside from the overtime period in New York's Game 5 loss to Philadelphia, Brunson has taken quality shots. His lowest field-goal percentage in the last four games is the 47 percent he shot in Game 5 against Philadelphia.\n\nSo these 40-point games aren't forced.\n\n\"I'm not going in thinking I need to score 40. That's not my mindset at all,\" Brunson said late Monday night. \"My mindset is to be aggressive, to make plays for myself and for others. So get in the paint and see what's happening. I (have) the confidence I know I can score in the paint. But I know I have the confidence in my teammates who are all moving and getting into positions where they can be successful, as well.\n\n\"So it's just the constant communication that we have. It's the trust that we have with each other. Do the best we can every single time we're on the court.\"\n\nThat formula has worked well so far for New York in the postseason.\n\nEach Knick starter played at least 36 minutes on Monday, while their reserves played a total of 26 minutes. Entering Monday's game, OG Anunoby, Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart were all averaging more than 40 minutes per game in the postseason.\n\nHart played all 48 minutes on Monday. DiVincenzo and Brunson played 44 each. Anunoby played 42. Is this workload sustainable for the rest of the postseason - however long it lasts?\n\n\"I think it's maintainable. Come in tomorrow. Watch film, take care of your body and be ready to go the next day,\" DiVincenzo said after scoring 21 in the second half and playing strong defense against Tyrese Haliburton. \"This time of the year, it's less about the wear and tear on your body and more about preparing for the next game mentality, watching film, adjusting that way, walking through plays rather than running through your stuff.\n\n\"So minutes aren't a factor right now, as long as we keep getting wins. Everybody knows the next game will be better, whether it's guys coming off the bench, whether it's the starting unit. So the minutes can fluctuate throughout the series. I don't think we're worried about the minutes.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_King", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bernard King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/sny_articles_235/d768b53fe283552b9355a0a9ca4fc996", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544845", "eventUri": "eng-9544845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 94, "relevance": 1}

After he earned his second career All-Star appearance with a season of 20.1 points and 10.9 assists per game, the 24-year-old's numbers have slipped in the postseason, as have Tyrese Haliburton props numbers, perhaps unsurprisingly.\n\nThe numbers matter less these days, obviously. The important thing was for Haliburton to get the Indiana Pacers past the Bucks in the first round. But still, averaging 14.6 points and 9.1 assists while shooting just 30.5% from deep doesn't create much hope for Haliburton to spur Indiana past the New York Knicks now.\n\nTyrese Haliburton should play better than he did in Game 1 of these Eastern Conference semifinals. Scoring just six points was a nadir, particularly when he then also handed out \"only\" eight assists and grabbed just two rebounds.\n\nHe had similar struggles in Game 1 of the first round, scoring nine points with eight assists and seven boards. The difference was he was at least aggressive then, going 4-of-7 from the field and 1-of-3 from 3. Compare those shooting splits to Monday's 2-of-6 from the field and 2-of-5 from deep.\n\nHaliburton taking merely a single 2-point field goal should cause the Pacers worry. For context, about 51% of his field-goal attempts came from deep this regular season, hitting 36.4% of them. Haliburton works well on the perimeter, in part because opponents also worry about him getting into the lane. Shifting that balance to almost entirely 3-point looks will not work out for Haliburton.\n\nThat balance has tilted in the postseason. In the six-game win against Milwaukee in the first round, Haliburton took 63.5% of his shots from deep. That's not how his game is designed, a reality compounded by hitting just 29.6% of those threes. Thus, Haliburton averaged 16 points in the first round.\n\nThe Knicks' defense fared even better taking away those drives on Monday, and it took them away in a replicable fashion. The length and relentlessness of New York's perimeter defenders -- primarily Josh Hart and OG Anunoby -- will continue to pester Haliburton's attempts to penetrate.\n\nHis 3-point shooting has fallen in the postseason. It cannot be relied upon for all of the Pacers point guard's scoring.\n\nHe should play better tonight than he did in Game 1, but that is a relatively low bar to clear. Until Haliburton regains a penchant for getting into the paint in these playoffs, fading his points prop makes too much sense.\n\nIf Haliburton continues to settle for 3-pointers in the postseason, then it is only logical to bet on him to make a few more of them. Missing a few extra 3s right now is a matter of variance. If he had gone 21-of-59 instead of 18-of-59 in the last seven games, he would be in line with his regular-season shooting percentage from deep.\n\nMissing those three added threes is not a minimal worry, but it is also not something to panic over.\n\nMeanwhile, taking that many threes is a difference in approach. That is not variance. That is a mentality shift, be it intentional or subconscious or demanded by defensive coverages. It will almost certainly continue, even if it's a bad sign for Indiana as a whole. Combining that influx in attempts with an expected regression to the mean of Haliburton's usual shooting percentage should yield confidence in him hitting at least three 3-pointers tonight.\n\nThe same thought process casts doubt on Haliburton's assists prop. If he's not driving into the lane, he will not kick to as many open shooters. Little more analysis is needed than that.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

That was shocking and there were many others.\"\n\nBrunson pulled a \"Willis Reed\" moment in the second half exactly 54 years ago since the iconic game of the Knicks legend.\n\nReed dramatically emerged from the Garden tunnel in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals as he hobbled through a thigh injury, inspiring the Knicks to win their first NBA title.\n\nBrunson, who was in the locker room the entire second quarter with a sore foot, re-emerge after halftime and willed the Knicks to a scintillating comeback from a 73-63 deficit.\n\nHe was not hobbling like Reed as he scored 24 of his 29 points in the second half, shrugging off the discomfort, to a loud \"MVP\" chants from the roaring 19,812 Madison Square Garden crowd.\n\n\"It was really cool to hear, but I just knew that I had to get my mind in the right place to figure out how I was going to attack the second half,\" Brunson told reporters.\n\nWhile the Knicks took a commanding 2-0 lead, they also suffered another major blow.\n\nOG Anunoby will be out for Game 3 after he exited late in the fourth quarter of Game 2 with a hamstring injury.\n\nIt is a tough pill to swallow especially after Anunoby scored a playoff career-high 28 points.\n\nBrunson is also questionable to play with right foot soreness.\n\nWithout Anunoby, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau will lean on Precious Achiuwa and Miles McBride to fill the defensive void.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Julius Randle was already gone for the season after efforts to come back from his dislocated right shoulder. Bojan Bogdanovic underwent surgery after a first-round foot injury. Mitchell Robinson was lost for the season after Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. And after Jalen Brunson threw a scare into the franchise and fan base Wednesday night, OG Anunoby was ruled out of Friday's Game 3 and will likely be lost for longer with a left hamstring strain. Brunson is listed as questionable with right foot soreness -- although that was the report on him Wednesday in the first half when he missed 15-plus minutes and he never sat for a second after halftime.\n\nAdd to the challenge that the Knicks were headed to hostile territory with Pacers coach Rick Carlisle firing up the state with a hard-to-believe rant about the officiating and small markets being shut out by the big-market hunting NBA, a bit of gamesmanship for the officials to consider for Game 3. The Knicks are now down to a banged-up Brunson -- as long as he can make it -- as the lone opening night starter left, a total of six players who have played significant minutes left.\n\nAnd somehow, they still believe. You hear a story often enough it starts to ring true and for the Knicks, that story has been coach Tom Thibodeau's insistence on a next-man-up philosophy, that the team has enough to get the job done even as the roster thins.\n\n\"I think we actually believe it,\" Josh Hart said. \"I think that's what it is. Obviously you never want injuries and sometimes you say things just to give an answer and kind of get through it. But we actually believe that.\n\n\"There's a lot of guys on this team that can start with other guys in this league, so when we say it, it's not cliche. It's not just we're saying it just because it sounds good. We're actually saying it because we believe it. I've got faith in every one of our guys. So with stuff like that, sometimes it sucks. It's like, 'Damn we can't catch a break?' But we truly believe it's next man up.\"\n\nIn 1997, when the Knicks got into a late-game fight with the Miami Heat in Game 5 of the playoffs and returned to Madison Square Garden missing most of their key players to suspension, the marketing team adopted a message -- \"Nine men, one mission.\" Nine men seems like a luxury to Thibodeau and the Knicks right now. Of the Knicks players eligible for Game 3, only six of them have played more than one minute this postseason. That includes Precious Achiuwa, who sat out four of the six first-round games and now likely will be pushed into a starting role.\n\nAs the series shifts to Gainbridge Fieldhouse, it won't just be Reggie Miller who was in attendance as a poke in the eye to the Knicks, but it will be 17,923 midwesterners screaming in their ears -- unless of course Knicks fans pile in party buses and invade the arena like they did in Philadelphia.\n\nIt might seem like insurmountable odds and truth be told, despite the slick marketing, the shorthanded Knicks lost that game in 1997 and lost the series. It might seem like history worth recalling. Still, you point out what seems like realities and the Knicks don't give in, insisting that they believe.\n\n\"I think there's a blueprint here that Thibs has laid out,\" Donte DiVincenzo said. \"No matter who is on the court, everybody follows that and doesn't go outside of themselves so no matter who is in the game we know what we're looking to get and any game we play as long as we defend with low turnovers, we can win any game.\n\n\"That was the mindset [Wednesday]. We hit them in the mouth and they came back in the second quarter and took the lead. We were in the locker room like we're going to win this game still. We got to defend, got to rebound, limit their second chances and play our offense. Not go outside ourselves. And that's exactly what we did. Whoever we have on the court, it's the same thing.\"\n\nHart has played 48 minutes in each of the first two games of the series -- unsurprising as he has sat just 15 minutes total in the eight postseason games combined. DiVincenzo played 44 on Wednesday.\n\n\"It just goes to show you it's a bunch of dogs on the team,\" Achiuwa said. \"Guys were locked in, ready to come in and play their parts for the most part. There's a lot of guys that love to win on the team, so you can't ask for nothing more than that. Once you have a bunch of guys that enjoy winning, and are willing to do whatever it takes to win a basketball game, you can go far with that . . . There's always a next-man up mentality on this team. We have a bunch of winners who are going to come in and contribute in any way they can.\"\n\nWhile others may twist themselves in knots trying to figure out who can step in now, for the Knicks it might be five players, maybe six and if you see a seventh something probably isn't going great. If it takes 48 minutes from their best players, that is what they will do. Six men, one mission?\n\n\"We know this is our way,\" Thibodeau said. \"Our way is to play really hard all the time and play together. If we do that, we'll have a chance.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

An elephant roaming free on the African savannah suffers the moment a poacher shoots and needlessly slaughters the animal for its ivory. But it's rarely ivory poachers who threaten its cousin the Asian elephant; it's holidaymakers.\n\nWildlife tourism across South East Asia is a money-spinning industry worth millions of US dollars a year. It plays a huge role in desecrating the highly endangered Asian elephant. Elephants giving trekking rides heavily laden with passengers, or shows with elephants performing degrading circus tricks, or paraded in costume through street festivals in extreme heat, through the din of firecrackers, drums and jostling crowds - all these attractions have the same purpose; to entice money from tourists. Unwittingly, holidaymakers are using their wallets to fuel exploitation and brutality to the Asian elephant for 'entertainment'.\n\nPoaching baby elephants from the wild for 'training'\n\nSave The Asian Elephants (STAE) raises awareness of the ruthless practice called 'pajan' or 'breaking of the spirit', which is used to make the elephant terrified and submissive for use in tourist entertainments. Baby elephants, which sell for as much as $125,000, are snatched from the wild and taken for brutal pajan 'training' at forest camps that supply elephants to nationwide facilities. A newly captured elephant will be beaten with iron rods, wooden planks and metal spikes, for an hour every day for months. In-between beatings the elephant handler (mahout) locks the elephant in a cramped isolation box traditionally called a kraal or 'crushing cage' where it is left dehydrated and starved for months. During pajan elephants suffer post traumatic stress and horrific, sometimes fatal injuries. It is estimated more than 50% of elephants die during or after this 'domestication' practice. There is no tamed elephant without pajan.\n\nIf you can pet it, ride it or watch it perform tricks, it has been subjected to pajan.\n\nIf the elephant survives, it can expect a long life of anguish and torment. Tragically captive elephants often die long before their natural life span of 70 years - from exhaustion, sickness or even from a particularly brutal 'correction' beating for misbehavior or disobedience.\n\nEyewitness account of captive elephants in India\n\nI'll never forget the sight of the pitiful elephants in shackles at a so-called temple in Kerala, India and at an elephant 'training' camp in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. I saw elephants rocking in psychological distress, destined to be chained to concrete blocks in the burning sun every day for years, even decades. Several were malnourished, some were blind, many had open sores and bleeding wounds. During the time I visited the camps two elephants died. There are various abominable secretive elephant 'training' camps in India.\n\nWitnessing the appalling condition of Asian elephants upset me so much I founded the charity Save The Asian Elephants (STAE). Leading conservationists, field experts, lawyers and campaigners from the UK and Asia sit on its board.\n\nA species brought to the brink of extinction\n\nLess than 20,000 wild elephants are left in India. The Asian elephant has been on the official IUCN endangered species list since 1986. Its world population has declined to just 40,000 today, down from more than a million at the beginning of the 20th century. Its numbers have decreased by 50% in the last 60 years alone. Asian elephant numbers are now just 5% of the number of African elephants.\n\nToday there are some 10,000 elephants captive across SE Asia and most are living in isolating and appalling conditions. This ancient, highly intelligent, family orientated, emotional and sensitive species deserves so much better.\n\nSTAE's core objective is to raise public awareness so as to influence politicians and change commercial practices. Western tour companies are often instrumental in driving the demand for unethical elephant holidays. We engage the range states at government and diplomatic levels resolutely, but respectful of the problems they face. STAE's website provides information on thoughtful and responsible policies for change. We inform the general public on how to recognise unethical elephant facilities and how to enjoy viewing elephants in their natural habitat instead.\n\nA global tourism industry fueling the demise of elephants\n\nConsumer power is key to persuading travel companies that unethical elephant tourist attractions are unacceptable. Boycott all forms of elephant entertainment and spread the truth about the 'behind the scenes' cruelty endured by elephants for 'entertainment'. All countries, especially those with the highest number of tourists to SE Asia, such as the UK and USA, should ban tour companies and other commercial interests from promoting unethical elephant attractions online or by any means.\n\nSave The Asian Elephants proposals STAE respectfully calls on India and the other SE Asian states to end elephant attractions, to implement their existing laws to ensure the proper treatment and care of elephants already in captivity and to move them to designated sanctuaries or the vast reserved forests.\n\nDo sign STAE's Change.org petition demanding the Indian government put an immediate end to the poaching of elephants from the wild for pajan 'training' and a life of unremitting abuse.\n\nThe abuse of Asian elephants, as exemplified by the practice of Pajan, is as indefensible as it is barbaric. Beating and torturing elephants snatched from the wild for tourist entertainment is a tragic stain on the standing and reputation of the region in the eyes of the world; and it is no way to treat a magnificent species at the brink of extinction. Without a seismic shift in public awareness, plus immediate serious commercial and political engagement in the Western world, India and its neighbouring states, the Asian elephant is doomed, in our lifetime and by our hands.", "timeCrawl": "16:24:00", "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8442309", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "id": 299, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

wrinkles of her slate-grey skin. She presses her whole head into the hose's force, the spray welling into her mouth. As she drinks, she rubs her skin against the steel fence, her eyelids drooping luxuriously, her trunk relaxing. If ever I've seen a captive elephant happy, it's Flora this morning.\n\nThere are no people laughing or pointing here at the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. There are no infants crying, no children arguing. The public are not allowed into the sanctuary, whose unofficial motto is, \"Allow elephants to be elephants\": give them the freedom of choice, the freedom of large areas to explore, the freedom from human gawkers (apart from via the online elecams) while still providing the kind of care that comes with a zoo.\n\nIn fact, few things are required of the 10 pachyderms here. They can sleep in the barn or they can spend the night among the pine-covered hills. They can stay in the shade or lounge in the sun. They can wander together for company like elephants in the wild or take off on a solo sojourn. They can chase turkeys or trumpet at deer. They can take a dust bath, roll in a mud wallow, or be sprayed by a keeper, as Flora chose on this day when the temperature hits 34C (93.2F).\n\n\"I don't think we will ever get away from elephants in captivity,\" Stephanie DeYoung, the director of elephant husbandry, tells me. \"But is it time to change how we keep them in captivity?\"\n\nThe Elephant Sanctuary spreads over 2,700 rolling acres. Beaten, starved, shackled\n\nWatching her now, it's hard to imagine Flora - a female African elephant, the largest and arguably most regal terrestrial animal on the planet - dressed up in a silly costume performing in a one-elephant act for 18 years. But that was her life before.\n\nWe are, as a species, generally fascinated by elephants. \"We see the qualities and characteristics in elephants that we aspire to have ourselves,\" says Patricia Sims, the co-founder of World Elephant Day. \"Empathy, enduring family bonds, cooperation, intelligence, long memories, taking care of their environment - to name just a few.\"\n\nSome extraordinary scientific studies in the last few years have revealed just how intelligent they are. They can recognise themselves in a mirror, found scientists in 2006, one of only a few species that do this. They can have an \"aha\" moment to solve a puzzle, showed researchers in 2011, by witnessing a young elephant in the National zoo in Washington DC who would move a block wherever she needed it to reach food. We even know now that what makes captive elephants happy is not the size of their pen, but whether they live with other elephants, thanks to a landmark collection of papers in the scientific journal PLOS ONE last year\n\nBut our desire to be close to these incredible creatures has led us down some ugly paths. We have ridden them, dressed them up in ridiculous attire, beaten them, starved them, and slaughtered them en masse. Today tens of thousands live shackled in prisons of our making.\n\nA video still from a report that was shown during the trial of circus trainer Mary Chipperfield, who was convicted in 1999 on 12 counts of animal cruelty.\n\nElephants are still gussied up to decorate weddings in India; in Sri Lanka they are locked in religious sites as living (but suffering) embodiments of a god; in Africa tourists ride trained elephants to see wild ones; in south-east Asia elephants are used to log the very forests they once called home; and worldwide elephants are still forced to perform silly tricks in circuses and zoos, tricks they are trained to do by brutalising methods, often using a bullhook, a large, sharp, medieval-looking instrument used to create pain in an elephant's sensitive spots.\n\nWhen I ask ecologist and author of Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel, Carl Safina, if he believes elephants are intelligent and conscious, he says that there is \"zero\" evidence that such animals are not conscious, while there is multiple lines of evidence - both physically and behaviourally - that they are.\n\nSo what are the implications of this? Besides their own particular form of consciousness, elephants have spectacularly good memories. Can they remember abuse and pain? Could some elephants even be described as traumatised? There have certainly been episodes that would seem to indicate this. In 1994, for example, a female African elephant named Tyke crushed her trainer to death in front of a circus audience in Honolulu. She escaped the tent and ran through the city streets for a half hour before police officers brought her down in a hail of 86 bullets. Like all circus elephants, she'd spent her life chained up, transported in trucks and beaten to perform. The only freedom she'd known was when she'd escape - and she'd done so twice before. (The 2013 documentary Blackfish, about a killer whale, Tilikum, appears to tell a very similar story about another of the earth's largest mammals.)\n\nSukari in her enclosure\n\nOver and over again, staff at the Tennessee sanctuary tell me that \"elephants never kill anyone accidentally\". Like humans, they can snap. Constant beatings, solitary confinement, being chained to the floor: all this can understandably push any elephant to the brink - and some will retaliate.\n\nIn her book Elephants on the Edge, Gay A Bradshaw argues that elephants - both wild and captive - can suffer psychological traumas, leading them to become more unpredictable and violent. \"When elephants lose their homes and families, are subjected to mass killing, and are captured and incarcerated in zoos, they breakdown mentally and culturally and exhibit symptoms found in human prisoners and victims of genocide,\" Bradshaw said in an interview with Scientific American.\n\nIn her book, Bradshaw describes an experiment where the symptoms of an elephant were sent to five mental health officials - who had no knowledge that they were diagnosing an elephant and not a human - but all of whom diagnosed the individual with PTSD.\n\nAs our understanding of the minds of our fellow species improves, will we increasingly look back at the way we have treated them in horror and repulsion?\n\nShirley's right ear was scarred when she was on a ship that caught fire and sank.\n\nUnloosening the chains\n\nThe impact of our changing understanding of elephant psychology has already been profound. Perhaps the most astounding change is at circuses. Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey, arguably the world's most famous circuses, stopped using elephants last year - and then closed for good this May after 146 years. Britain's last circus elephant, Anne, was rescued in 2011 after the Daily Mail revealed she was being viciously abused. Twenty countries have banned the use of elephants in circuses. Even India has banned elephants in both circuses and zoos - though the process of retiring the elephants is gradual.\n\n\"The day's gone by of putting an animal in a cage and calling it entertainment. I think more and more people realise that is ridiculous,\" says DeYoung.\n\nLife in zoos is generally not as abusive for elephants as in circuses. Zoo elephants are not travelling overland on a weekly basis, are not usually chained up for days to weeks to years on end, and are not usually forced to perform tricks day in and day out.\n\nBut there have been enormous changes here too. Recognising the social needs of elephants, the US's Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) now requires that any accredited zoo must have at least three female elephants, two males or three mixed genders in order to make sure elephants have peers although facilities can apply for an expectation. (There has been less progress on space: a creature known to roam hundreds to thousands of square kilometres in the wild gets as little as 500 square metres of outside space in a zoo.)\n\nThe best zoos are changing concrete cages to natural environments, adding more enrichment and taking their elephants for daily walks to increase exercise. Today, 43 zoos are members of the Elephant Welfare Initiative, which tracks real-time data on their pachyderms, all in an effort to improve conditions. And many elephant keepers now have behavioural backgrounds, an acknowledgement of the species' deep psychological needs, explains Otto Fad, an animal behaviour and welfare specialist. \"All of us 'elephant geeks' are paying attention,\" he says.\n\nAdult elephants and a calf chained in an indoor enclosure at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, US in 1989. Photograph: Scott McKiernan/Zuma/Alamy\n\nBut progress is slow, and patchy. China is buying up wild elephants from Africa, and Chinese zoos are hardly known for humane conditions, and eyewitnesses say zoos there are forcing elephants to do unnatural tricks to entertain visitors, much like circuses. Even in Europe controversy remains: In April, Peta released footage of keepers at the Hanover zoo in Germany using a bullhook and whip to train juvenile elephants to perform tricks. The European Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the AZA both still allow the use of bullhooks.\n\nAnd then there are the 15,000 to 20,000 elephants around the world that still spend their lives in chains. \"Harsh,\" is how Carol Buckley, the head of Elephant Aid International, describes conditions in Asia. \"With little exception, they live in chains when not being dominated by their mahout to perform.\" The mahouts \"suffer equally ... [Both] live in squalor, deprived of the most basic needs.\" In Indonesia, activists have photographed an elephant in a zoo that lives alone with its feet tied together by a chain. It can't move a single step.\n\nSo, what to do? We can't just open the pen doors and unloosen all the chains.\n\nIf only they could all go and live in the sanctuary.\n\nRonnie (on the left) and Sissy in their enclosures. Out of shot are their companions. All are free to roam in 100s of acres.\n\n\"They are allowed to express themselves\"\n\nNo institution is perfect. Founded in 1995, the 2,700-acre sanctuary - North America's only one dedicated solely to elephants - has seen its own set of tragedies and challenges, none worse than when a keeper was killed in 2006 by an Asian elephant.\n\nBut it is a genuine sanctuary for once abused elephants, tended to by the most devoted of staff, who practise a form of elephant care known as \"protected contact\" or PC, a type of training invented in the 1990s by San Diego zoo. This is in opposition to what's called free contact, which generally depends on bullhooks and punishment. Keeper Kristy Sands Eaker says PC is about \"mutual respect\", and about positive reinforcement - rewards for good behaviour - rather than punishment. \"They know we are not going to enter their space ... They are allowed to express themselves ... if they do not want to participate in something ... they can react and there's no punishment for that.\"\n\nAt the same time, the animals are not romanticised: elephants and keepers are always separated by a steel barrier; there are always at least two keepers working with an elephant, and all are aware they are dealing with four-tonne animals capable of killing with a single strike of its trunk.\n\nThe sanctuary houses 10 female elephants - it doesn't take males at this time. It has room for six more, but it's surprisingly difficult to obtain new elephants. After all, elephants are money makers for circuses and zoos, which are often loathe to give them up. This is why the sanctuary is never sent young elephants: the younger the elephant, the bigger the jackpot. In an attempt to create bridges between the circus or zoo world and the sanctuary, the staff say their elephants are \"retired\" - not \"rescued\".\n\nThe sanctuary has no interest in breeding on the site. \"We're not breeding for animals to live in captivity,\" says CEO Janice Zeitlin. \"And this is captivity.\"\n\nSome of these elephants have harrowing stories. Sissy, stolen from the wild in 1969, survived a flood in Texas in 1981, spending 36 hours submerged under water with just her trunk above the surface. For years she was terrified of water, but after coming to the sanctuary she started wading in pools again.\n\n\"This is what the sanctuary is about,\" says Zeitlin. \"These celebrations. These milestones.\"\n\nSome elephants arrived with self-mutilation behaviours, such as biting their ears or tusking their own legs. \"It's a coping mechanism, and a lot of that is based on stress,\" explains DeYoung.\n\nI spend the day at the sanctuary with remarkable women. DeYoung moved across the country to work here. Zeitlin came as a 20-years-old volunteer and today runs the place. Sands Eaker worked up to the day she gave birth to twins. She told me she sometimes feels she knows the elephants better than her own children. This is not a job for them, it's a calling, a devotion, a love.\n\nI wonder if they are aware of the similarities between them and the elephants they care for. On the one hand, we have a highly intelligent, empathetic, deeply conscious species that has survived millions of years through a powerful matriarchal society. And, on the other, are the women of another species determined to give these pachyderm ladies the best years of their life, determined to do their utmost to heal the wounds caused by our sins.\n\nGiven that they are often taking in geriatric elephants - the youngest on site is 33 - workers at the facility have become accustomed to loss. In its 22 years, they have seen 17 elephants die. In 2013, they started a new policy of euthanising elephants when they felt they were suffering from irreversible health problems causing unrelenting suffering.\n\nAn elephant grave at the Elephant Sanctuary.\n\n\"There was a philosophical change,\" DeYoung says, noting that founders preferred allowing \"nature to take its course\". The final decision comes down to the vets, but includes input from all the staff. Since 2013 they have humanely euthanised five elephants.\n\n\"We feel we are the stewards of this animal and it is our responsibility to take care of them - in life and in death,\" adds DeYoung.\n\nWhen death comes - whether due to euthanasia or other causes - the other elephants are allowed to spend as long as they need with the body. Elephants are buried on site and marker stones erected. Staff have observed elephants visiting the graves of their lost companions, especially those they were particularly bonded to. More then 10 years after Jenny's death, Shirley still marches into the wood to mourn beside her grave.\n\nInto the wild\n\nBut even if every zoo in the world was like the sanctuary, captivity can never replicate the wild.\n\nConservationists rarely consider the idea of releasing captive elephants back into the wild, but it has been done. Elephant Reintroduction, a NGO in Thailand, has reintroduced more than a hundred once-captive elephants into three protected areas since 2002. The work is challenging. Premjith Hemmawath, with the organisation, says mahouts had to teach one elephant how to drink water from the river instead of the tap. Still, many reintroduced elephants have thrived in this programme, with some even reproducing in the wild.\n\nFewer captive elephants have been released in Africa, but there are successes there too. Eight adult captive elephants housed in African countries (five males and three females) have been rereleased in Botswana. The most incredible example of reintroductions are Durga and Owalla, American circus elephants that were reintroduced into a park in South Africa in 1982. Both went on to have their own calves.\n\nIt's expensive - that's one issue. But the biggest problem, as Safina says, is that \"there's no place to free them to\". Asia is losing its habitat at record rates and surviving elephants are already coming into near-constant conflict with human populations. In Africa, the situation is even more dire due to unrelenting poaching. According to the Great Elephant Census, around 144,000 African savannah elephants have been lost in less than a decade in 18 African countries. But no one has even been able to count African forest elephants - a distinct species - which have taken the brunt of the poaching epidemic.\n\n\"Welfare is a concept that can be applied to any animal in any situation, not just wielded as a weapon to attack zoos,\" said Fad. \"Does anyone thinks that a starving elephant who just had her lower jaw blown off by a hakka pata [a makeshift explosive inserted in fruits and vegetables to injure or kill any animal raiding fields] takes comfort in her 'wild' status?\"\n\nSafina, who has spent a lot of time with elephants in the wild, adds that today wild elephants suffer from \"more danger, stress, and harm ... than do elephants who live in the better zoos, where they are comfortably bored\". Compared with the plight of wild elephants, he says, \"captivity issues are a sideshow\".\n\nBefore I left for Tennessee, I showed my six-year-old daughter a video about Shirley's life. A 69-year-old Asian elephant at the sanctuary, Shirley survived a shipwreck, a truck crash and an attack by another elephant that left her crippled - her right hind leg forever-after bent at an irregular angle. I held my daughter as she wept through the video, but afterwards she brightened up and drew a picture for me to bring to Shirley.\n\nI wasn't sure I was going to see Shirley, though. The staff said she likes to wander deep into the forest, and she was the kind of elephant that would decide for herself whether to grace you with her presence.\n\nIn the afternoon, we find an Asian elephant, Tara, and the staff proceed to give her a shower and feed her treats. But far away - just a large shadow-like shape deep among the tall Tennessee pines - stands another.\n\n\"That's Shirley,\" Sands Eaker tells me, adding that the crippled leg \"doesn't limit her. I've seen her climb some of the steepest hills - which I wouldn't climb myself.\"\n\nWe wait. And watching Shirley - just a silhouette in the forest - I feel that tinge - that pull - so many of us feel in the presence of an elephant, like we're meeting a being both similar and alien, a great four-legged giant, a kind of demi-deity, a wise mother. Of course, it's often a toxic intimacy: our desire to be close to elephants more often than not has resulted in their suffering and despair. We're not elephants - and no human can replace an elephant for an elephant.\n\nThe writer holds a picture of Shirley, seen behind him on the right, drawn by his daughter as a present to her.\n\nBut maybe our greater understanding of elephant needs will allow us to let them go - to let them be free again. To make sure captive elephants are living in places where they can be elephants again. And, for those in the wild: to stop slaughtering them for trinkets, to invite them to share this world with us unmolested.\n\n\"Oh, Shirley!\" Sands Eaker exclaims.\n\nAnd Shirley comes out of the forest to greet us.\n\nI take a photo for my daughter - since the sanctuary is not open to the public she'll never get to see Shirley herself - and I hope the image will be enough to impart that awe, that wonder, that reverence that radiates off these great beings. I hope it's enough for my daughter, and all of us, to extend our empathy to a species alien to ourselves.\n\nAfter all, that's what elephants would do.\n\n* This year's World Elephant Day includes a march in Washington DC, a fundraiser at Chester zoo to combat elephant disease, and a special event at the Elephant Sanctuary's new outdoor classroom in Hohenwald, Tennessee.", "timeCrawl": "07:21:00", "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8757405", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "id": 286, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "id": 313, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 6}}

conflicts have been escalating, making sensational headlines across India. One of the recent deaths of a harmless wild tusker, affectionately called \"Chilli Komban,\" sparked outrage among wildlife activists, with the Kerala government laying criminal charges against those who rammed him to death with an excavator.\n\nIn a rather humorous story, a herd of elephants drove a farmer up a tree, in the Idukki district of Kerala, as he remained there drenched to his bones before the forest department arrived and scared off the elephants using fireworks and drums. It could have been disastrous for the farmer, as humans have been trampled to death by elephants in the past.\n\nThe underlying issue is the significant growth in human population, which reached a milestone as of August. It now stands at 7.5 billion, of which 1.34 billion humans are in India, spitting out babies literally by the second, as tracked by Worldometers.\n\nDriven by the ever-expanding human population, the Asian elephants are faced with pre-eminent threats including habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. Development projects, agricultural plantations, construction of dams, roads, and railway lines continue to fragment the elephant habitats, disrupting their migratory routes. According to a report by the government of India, 40 elephants have been killed on railway tracks between 2014 and July 2017.\n\nAnother media report suggests that \"The destruction of their natural habitat and the disruption of elephant corridor are said to be the reasons for the increased incidents of elephant intrusion into human habitations.\"\n\nMaking matters worse is the fact that a substantial proportion of India's population lives near the fringes of the elephants' ranges, splitting up elephant herds into small and isolated pockets and threatening their long-term survival. In the second most densely populated country in the world, a huge percentage of the elephants' former range has been lost, and the remaining habitat is shrinking rapidly.\n\nAnd as the human population multiplies in these areas, the elephant habitats are being transformed into farmland, luring elephants to the crops that the farmers rely on for their livelihoods, further intensifying human-elephant confrontations. In extreme cases of conflicts, elephants have been caught and taken to the so-called Elephant Training Centers where they languish, lost to the wildlife population. According to the World Wildlife Fund, these confrontations are the leading cause of elephant deaths in Asia.\n\nThe pathetic plight of Kallur Komban, a wild tusker who was captured from the forests of Wynad in Kerala for \"raiding crops\" epitomizes the conundrum, as his condition briskly deteriorates.\n\nThe forest authorities are currently mulling over the capture of two \"rogue tuskers\" and \"marauding jumbos\" who are \"menacing\" the local residents near Munnar district. These instances are a stark reminder that proactive and strategic measures need to be taken immediately in curbing human-elephant conflicts.\n\nThe harsh reality is elephants are one of the first species to suffer the consequences of habitat fragmentation, development, and agriculture. Being the largest living land mammal, they require larger areas to roam, as well as more food and water than most other mammals. This makes it difficult to coexist with people in areas where agriculture is the dominant form of land use.\n\n'One of the largest conservation challenges in Asia today'\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) puts it succinctly: \"The long-term future of elephants outside protected areas, as well as in some protected areas, is therefore inextricably linked to mitigating such human-elephant conflicts, and this is one of the largest conservation challenges in Asia today.\"\n\nEven in the early part of the twentieth century, more than 100,000 Asian elephants thrived across Asia, however, in the last three generations, their numbers have declined by at least 50 per cent, as they continue to vanish at an unprecedented rate. Today there are approximately 40,000-50,000 Asian elephants, with at least 30,000 of them thriving in the Indian jungles as of 2012, making it imperative for the government of India to protect this global treasure.\n\nThe Nilgiri biosphere reserve, a 5,000-square-kilometre paradise stretching across three states in southern India, boasts more than half of the Indian elephant population at 16,265, with the northern Indian state of Assam housing 5,620 elephants as of 2012. These states are particularly vulnerable to human-elephant conflicts.\n\nMeantime, as we celebrate the World Elephant Day, there are reasons to be optimistic. The highest authority of India, the Supreme Court, has stepped up to the plate to curb human-elephant conflict, ordering the creation of \"27 corridors across the country for safe passage of elephants and other endangered animals, and directed it to \"positively\" file a response within three months.\"\n\nIn addition to creating corridors, the forest department of Kerala with the densest elephant population in the country is planning to plant fruit-bearing trees and dig water holes in core areas of the forest, as food and water shortage is pushing elephants out of the forest and luring them into human dwellings.\n\n\"The Walayar forest range has already raised 5,000 saplings of jackfruit, mango, papaya and 'njaval' in two nurseries in association with the Velancheri forest protection committee under the 'Green India' project of the Union ministry of forest and environment,\" an article from The Times of India read.", "timeCrawl": "19:40:00", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 1492, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1501}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8474139", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

On the two days there will be further information about the elephants from 10am to 5pm including activities and talks at the Lorikeet Lawn or in the Elephant Pagoda.\n\nThere is also an opportunity to adopt an elephant or make a pledge to help learn about and protect the endangered species.\n\nMiguel Bueno, curator of Living Collections, said: \"Our Ele-Celebrations aim to highlight the plight of elephants and raise awareness about these endangered species.

"Restrictions on elephants' free movement, scarcity of their food and development work in their habitats by government and non-government organisations fuelled the elephant-human conflict in the country, leading to deaths on both sides.\n\nThese reasons behind the conflict were identified in a study -- \"Status of Asian Elephants in Bangladesh\" -- conducted jointly by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Department of Forests (DoF).\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund, which observes today as World Elephant Day, says the elephant-human conflict is a result of habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\nWhen elephants and humans interact, there is conflict from crop raiding, injuries and deaths to humans caused by elephants, and elephants are killed by humans for reasons other than ivory collection, says the WWF.\n\nThe study, conducted earlier in the year, noted that the endangered mammoth animals are always forced to enter locality and \"lock into clash with humans\".\n\nDoF data show as many as 227 people and 63 elephants got killed in the conflict in 13 years since 2003. Sixteen people and four elephants were killed while 20 other people were injured in 2016 alone.\n\nThe first ever comprehensive study on elephants in Bangladesh since the liberation war also found 457 elephants in the country's forests and 57 elephants crossing trans-boundary points.\n\nThe elephant population of Bangladesh was investigated from August 2013 to April 2016.\n\nCurrently, there are 268 resident wild, 93 migratory and 96 captive elephants in the country, it said.\n\nThe study citing a previous study said about 100 years ago elephants were apparently present in most of the forests of Bangladesh.\n\n\"From field observations it was found that food shortage, habitat loss and fragmentation, and direct killing of elephants are the main threats to elephants in Bangladesh.\"\n\n\"Human-elephant conflict has been on the rise because of human intervention in the elephant corridors. Elephant habitat has also been destroyed over the times,\" Abdul Motaleb, one of the authors of the study, told The Daily Star.\n\nThere are 12 internal corridors and among them, five were about to close and all the trans-boundary corridors had been closed earlier, he said.\n\nThe study was conducted in all the elephant ranges of Bangladesh and nine forest divisions were investigated for estimating the resident and migratory elephant populations.\n\nHuman settlements, agricultural lands, roads and highways, brick fields, and village markets were constructed within or near the elephant movement routes and corridors, which fueled the elephant-human conflicts in the country, it said.\n\nThe study also identified 12 elephant corridors that were used by the wild elephants to pass from one habitat to another -- among them five were almost closed due to human intervention and the rest are also under severe threat.\n\n\"The present condition of the corridors is not suitable for elephant movement due to human interventions. If this situation continues the corridors will be blocked gradually, resulting in the elephants being pocketized and loss of their genetic viability, which would ultimately lead to extinction of this species,\" the study said.\n\nIt also said, \"As elephants always follow their fixed routes and corridors during movement and construction of infrastructures have largely affected their mobility. Because of huge dietary requirements, elephants extensively search for food, water, and shelter within a particular habitat or other habitats.\"\n\nDuring the 2nd Indo-Bangladesh Dialogue on Trans-Boundary Conservation of Elephants held in India's Shillong in late July, both the countries agreed to ensure safe passage for the animal.\n\nJahidul Kabir, conservator of forests (wildlife and nature conservation circle), said, \"There are a number of pocket gates for elephant movement. We have urged our counterpart to keep the corridors open round the clock.\n\n\"Border Security Force has showed objection but the Indian authorities said they will talk to the high officials in this regard.\"\n\nHe also said both the sides discussed on developing elephant habitat in the countries and not to build any electric fence in the natural migration corridors.\n\n\"All these issues were drafted, if our home ministry and foreign ministry agreed, we will finalise the draft,\" he said, adding, protecting elephants was the both sides' top priority.\n\nMohammad Sultan Ahmed, assistant wildlife biologist of IUCN Bangladesh office, said, \"Elephant habitat should be protected to preserve elephants in Bangladesh. If their habitat is protected, the regeneration of elephant will automatically take place.\"", "timeCrawl": "18:46:00", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "2016-04-", "date": "2013-08-", "textStart": 1424, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1449}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8682408", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The initiative connects individuals and organisations around the world to raise awareness of the issues threatening these iconic species in the wild.\n\nAnd this weekend (Saturday August 12 - Sunday August 13) visitors to Twycross Zoo will have access to multiple elephant-themed activities and games, as well as a chance to enter a prize draw to win a family ticket to the Zoo.\n\nTwycross Zoo has four female Asian elephants and in the naturalistic 'Elephant Creek' visitors can see how elephants form herds that are led by the oldest and largest female, called the matriarch.\n\nAt the zoo, this is Mimbu's role and she is often seen to be taking care for the others in her family herd and making decisions for the group. On the other hand, the youngest of the group, three-year old Esha is the most playful elephant and is always keen to use her trunk in exploration.\n\nVisitors can learn more details about each of the elephants at the Zoo from daily keeper's talks at 11.15am. On August 12/13 there will be further information about the elephants from 10am-5pm including elephantastic activities and talks at the Lorikeet Lawn or in the Elephant Pagoda. There is also an opportunity to adopt an elephant or make a pledge to help learn about and protect the endangered species.\n\nAsian elephants, one of the two surviving species, range across 13 countries in the wild, but in the last 50 years their habitat has shrunk by over 70% and there are now less than 40,000 remaining individuals worldwide.\n\nAsia is the world's most densely populated continent and the remaining Asian elephant population is shrinking fast due to multiple human threats, which include human-wildlife conflict, habitat loss due to agriculture and development. Illegal poaching also threatens this endangered species because elephant tusks are highly sought after in the illegal ivory trade.\n\nMiguel Bueno, Curator of Living Collections said: \"Our Ele-Celebrations aim to highlight the plight of elephants and raise awareness about these endangered species. The threat to elephants is a global issue and we need to cooperate across countries to encourage their conservation. The loss of elephants as a species would have drastic effects on our natural world.\n\n\"Although many people admire elephants, few know about their importance in helping maintain the ecosystems in forests and grasslands. Ele-Celebrations at Twycross Zoo provide a fun and entertaining day out at the zoo, whilst educating our visitors about the role of elephants in the world and showing them why they should care about these animals.\"\n\nTwycross Zoo is open to the public from 10am to 6pm.

The campaign is planned to cover 12 elephant range states.\n\nAddressing the gathering on the occasion, Dr. Vardhan urged the people to prepare a strategy for a more even distribution of the elephant population in all the states of the country. The Minister emphasised that an attempt must be made to bring to an end the chapter of man-animal conflict. He added that a war must be waged against poachers and hunters who harm elephants and other wildlife. Calling for proactive, innovative and out-of-the-box ideas, Dr. Vardhan said that efforts for elephant conservation must bring about a qualitative improvement by the next World Elephant Day.\n\nDr. Vardhan pointed to the need to broad-base the movement for conservation of elephants and to involve people from all walks of life in the conservation of elephants and other wildlife. He emphasised the immense energy and potential of children in making such movements successful, as was the case with the anti-Polio campaign. The Minister said that an effort would be made to install the models of elephants being carved out from waste material at prominent public places like Parliament, Rashtrapati Bhawan and at the Ministry's premises in Indira Paryavaran Bhawan.\n\nThe Environment Minister released the All India Census 2017 Report on elephants as also the Agreed Points of Action on Trans-Boundary Conservation of Elephants by India and Bangladesh and a document titled 'Right of Passage' on elephant corridors in India. A compilation, 'Glimpses of Initiatives Taken for Elephant Conservation in India (2012-2017) based on Parliamentary Questions and Replies' by ENVIS Centre, WWF-India and the Project Elephant Division, MoEF&CC, was also released. The publication covers the concerned environmental issues in the form of a compact disc, which can serve as a ready reference source for scientists, policy-makers, technocrats and others concerned with the cause of conservation and sustainable development. Later, Dr. Vardhan administered a pledge on elephant conservation to the children present on the occasion.\n\nThe Director-General Forest and Special Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri Siddhanta Das, Director, Project Elephant, Shri R.K Shrivastav, Director, Wildlife Trust of India, Shri Vivek Menon and Prof R. Sukumar also addressed the gathering.\n\nDuring the period of the campaign, artists and craftsmen will create life-size works on the theme of elephants in places along the route of the roadshow, covering 12 states that have wild elephants, using local art and craft. Specially fabricated vehicles will be deployed to display these on pre-determined routes with campaigners. The 'Gaju' mascot, which was released by the Ministry in 2012, will be helm the campaign. The campaign will be led by the Wildlife Trust of India.\n\nActor and wildlife enthusiast, Ms. Dia Mirza, participated in the walk and run event organised on the occasion along with the children.\n\nWORLD ELEPHANT DAY: BRIEF BACKGROUND\n\nWorld Elephant Day is an annual global event celebrated across the world on August 12, dedicated to the preservation and protection of elephants. The goal of World Elephant Day is to create awareness about the plight of elephants and to share knowledge and positive solutions for the better care and management of captive and wild elephants. African elephants are listed as \"vulnerable\" and Asian elephants as \"endangered\" in the IUCN Red List of threatened species. As per the available population estimates, there are about 400,000 African elephants and 40,000 Asian elephants.\n\nWorld Elephant Day is celebrated to focus the attention of various stakeholders in supporting various conservation policies to help protect elephants, including improving enforcement policies to prevent illegal poaching and trade in ivory, conserving elephant habitats, providing better treatment for captive elephants and reintroducing captive elephants into sanctuaries. The elephant is part of India's animal heritage and the Government celebrates this day to spread awareness about the conservation of the species.\n\nThough a nation-wide population census exercise for elephants is conducted every five years, this is the first time than an all-India synchronised elephant census was carried out one year in advance, to avoid errors in estimation arising from the significant movement of elephants across different states. The field operations of the census were completed in May 2017 and data has been compiled on direct count, indirect count (dung count), waterhole and salt lick observations. Elephant distribution mapping has also been done.\n\nWorld Elephant Day was conceived in 2011 by Canadian filmmakers Ms. Patricia Sims and Mr. Michael Clark of Canazwest Pictures and the Secretary- General of the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation of Thailand, Sivaporn Dardarananda.

Currently, the elephant, a young adult aged around 25, has been spotted in Sahibganj district of Jharkhand. A hunter from Hyderabad has already arrived and is camping in the area for the purpose. The elephant had last killed two persons over two days on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nMost of its victims have been members of the Paharia tribal - a primitive tribal group with a thin population of over 25,000 in the state, who live in the densely forested hills of Sahibganj district. According to the officials, the elephant entered Jharkhand from Bihar late in March. In between, it again crossed into Bihar and then returned to Jharkhand. Efforts made to tranquilise the elephants have not yielded results, even as casualties have occurred.\n\nJharkhand's Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) L R Singh said: \"We have been trying to tranquilise and capture the elephant for nearly a fortnight. But it has not yielded results. On the other hand, casualties have taken place. Therefore, finally, we gave orders to shoot to kill the elephant.\"\n\nIn order to get the task executed, the forest authorities have called Nawab Shafath Ali Khan of Hyderabad. He has already arrived in Jharkhand and camping with the team in Sahibganj. \"He is among the most experienced names and is credited with culling neel gais in Bihar and killing a rogue elephant last year in the same state. He has been with us for the past few days. In fact, he has been trying to tranquilise and capture the elephant. But the terrain is proving to be the main difficulty,\" said Singh. The effort would ensure least painful death.\n\nThe elephant is roaming in the Raj Mahal Hills in Taljhari, Borio and Sahibganj Blocks. \"The visibility becomes less than 15 feet and the forest is so dense that entering it has not been possible. That is why we were forced to finally issue the orders for killing,\" said Singh. The last sighting of the elephant was in a dense area in Taljhari Block, he said.\n\nRecalling the elephant's venture into Jharkhand, Singh said that, on March 24, the elephant entered Jharkhand from Bihar. \"It had already killed three in Bihar and began killing people in Jharkhand. Then, in between, for a brief period, it re-entered Bihar and killed one more person. Later, it again returned to Jharkhand and has, so far, killed 11 persons in all,\" he said. The last two killings took place on August 7 and 8.\n\nThe area in which the elephant has been roaming is populated by the Paharias. \"They live in small settlements of six to seven hutments on the top of the hills amid dense forests. The elephant emerges suddenly, charges at the person and then slips out of the view after killing. It has been charging even at the team equipped with torches,\" said Singh. He added that the authorities in Bihar have not been able to identify the herd from which the elephant separated.\n\nDivisional Forest Officer (Sahibganj) Manish Tiwari said: \"Our teams have been at the job. We have ensured that many villagers have left their settlements on the hill tops and come down to a safe place. The compensation to the victims has also been paid. We are trying to get the job done with minimum inconvenience to the villagers.\"\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "timeCrawl": "15:44:00", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "2017-08-08", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2887, "date": "2017-08-07", "textStart": 2873}, {"date": "2017-08-10", "textStart": 47, "amb": false, "textEnd": 62}, {"date": "-03-24", "textStart": 2530, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2538}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8434281", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "id": 460, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature", "id": 549, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "id": 879, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The elephant, aged around 25 years, was last seen in Sahibganj district of Jharkhand and a hunter from Hyderabad has arrived and is camping in the area. The elephant had killed two persons earlier this week. Most of the victims were from the Paharia tribe who live in the densely forested hills of Sahibganj district. Efforts were made to tranquilise the elephant but have not yielded results so far. Jharkhand's Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) L R Singh said, \"We have been trying to tranquilise and capture the elephant for nearly a fortnight. But it has not yielded results. On the other hand, casualties have taken place... finally, we gave orders to shoot to kill.\"\n\nForest authorities have called Nawab Shafath Ali Khan of Hyderabad who is camping with the team in Sahibganj. \"He is among the most experienced names and is credited with culling neelgais in Bihar and killing a rogue elephant last year in the same state. He has been with us for the past few days. In fact, he has been trying to tranquilise and capture the elephant. But the terrain is proving to be the main difficulty,\" Singh said, adding they will try to ensure minimum pain to the elephant. The elephant is roaming in the Raj Mahal Hills in Taljhari, Borio and Sahibganj blocks. \"Visibility is less than 15 feet and the forest is so dense that entering it has not been possible... we were forced to issue the orders,\" Singh said.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "timeCrawl": "23:15:00", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 50, "amb": false, "textEnd": 65}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8503959", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "id": 361, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "id": 362, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "id": 879, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

At times, road transport was blocked and the movement of trains were rescheduled a bit between certain stations to facilitate the animals 'stroll' back into their natural habitat.\n\nWhile the rate of man-wild elephant conflict is proportionately low in Kerala, given the higher elephant population compared to other states, incidents of animals expanding the boundaries of their territories in search of food and water have been a recurring theme in recent times. A prime reason is the disruption of elephant corridors due to increased human activity over the years. \"The free movement of wild elephants has been restricted and this has been aggravated by a marginal increase in the elephant population,\" says Rajesh, a wildlife enthusiast whose main vocation is to track both domestic and wild elephants in Kerala.\"The shortage of fodder and wild growth in the forests was another reason for these elephants to come down to the human areas. Imagine a situation last week when a wild elephant walked up to the ticket counter of the Olavakkode railway station at midnight. It was unimaginable a few years ago.\"\n\nHe says wild elephants are now entering the plains from all sides of the Western Ghats. From the Karulai range in Malappuram, the wild elephants have reached Nilambur town. In Attappadi and Mannarkad, Puduppariyaram and Mundur, the elephants had come up to Keralassery town last year. This year, through Mundur, they reached Kinavaloor, Parli, Ottappalam and Mankara in Palakkad, and on to Thiruvilwamala in Thrissur. The beasts were entering Nelliampathy from the entire Sahayadri hills too.\n\nSays Mohammed Ali, a native of Mankara, who stood watching the three elephants cooling in the Bharathapuzha: \"We send our children to the madrassa early in the morning. We also travel to the nearby mosque for prayers after dusk. Many people go out to work. Our houses are not that strong either. There were no lights in the area. We live in constant fear. People going out and intimidating the elephants by bursting crackers, beating drums and burning torches forced the elephants to move from Iyermala and Maankurissy to Peringottukurissy, Kottayi and Thiruvilwamala areas.\"\n\nAdds Kannan, a farmer of Kayarampara near Ottappalam: \"The elephants destroyed large tracts of paddy, plantains, pumpkins and small coconut palms causing huge losses.\" Wildlife expert and former Kerala Forest Research Institute director E P Easa says the Forest Department should watch out for the permanent exit point of such elephants from the forests", "timeCrawl": "04:38:00", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8872257", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "id": 892, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Lal Ratnakar Singh issued the orders late on Thursday after the forest department's officers dismissed the idea of tranquilising and putting the 25-year-old male tusker in captivity in an attempt to save its life.\n\nSpeaking over the phone from Sahibganj's Taljheri block, Singh said tranquilizing the elephant was risky due to the beast's aggressive nature and the dense vegetation in the area. Shooting tranquilising darts at the elephant could have agitated it, Singh said.\n\n\"It could open a blind charge at our men or at the settlements, raising chances of further death and destruction,\" Singh said. The sedative takes more than 30 minutes to work once injected.\n\nHunters, who are accompanied by forest guards, are finding it difficult to locate the elephant. \"People are being forced to walk through the hilly terrain to search for it. Twice in the past three days, it came close to injuring our men,\" a senior forester said. The foresters said the elephant was not intimidated by man-made fires lit up to drive him away.\n\nThe state forest department has called Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, a famous hunter from Hyderabad, to kill the elephant. Khan has been camping in the forests of Sahibganj for about a week.\n\nThe 'loner', which has killed 11 people in Jharkhand and four in Bihar, is entering villages after sunset and charging at any human in its sight, Singh said.\n\nThe elephant has been attacking forest guards trying to chase him from human habitats, he added. The elephant, which was declared 'rogue' by the state forest department, has killed three people in Sahebganj in the last five days.\n\nIn 2008, a rogue elephant was killed in Bokaro after it crushed four people to death.

A team led by well-known hunter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan from Hyderabad, along with veterinarians, had been camping in the higher reaches of Raj Mahal hills of Sahibganj for the purpose. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Wildlife, L R Singh, said: \"The team managed to track down the elephant around 6 pm near Banjhi Santhali village in Taljhari Block of Sahibganj district. Two bullets were shot.\"\n\nAccording to officials, the elephant was shot in the head and after it fell, another round was fired as a confirmation shot. The post-mortem was conducted last night. The burial was done Saturday due to heavy overnight rain, he added. Singh insisted it was an unfortunate act but that it was the only resort.\n\n\"We tried to tranquilise it. But to do that, you have to come very close to it. One of our veterinary doctors nearly got killed three days ago. Due to dense forest, it was also not possible to use an aerial route. Still, we tried to tranquilise it more than a couple of times. Permission to kill was unfortunate, but last resort,\" he said.\n\nAnother option was to dig trenches and trap it. But that too could not be done because it was a hilly terrain and not a plain area. \"When the elephant is moving in an area of around 100 square km, digging trenches was not feasible,\" he said, adding that entering the forest for a person was not possible.\n\nThe official further added the casualties could have continued to increase had several people from villages atop the densely forested hills not come down to lower areas. Singh further added that, after the elephant killed three people, the Bihar counterparts of the forest department had almost declared it 'rogue.' \"But then it came over to Jharkhand and we had been trying to capture it,\" he said.\n\nThe elephant is reported to have crossed over to Jharkhand on March 24. It killed another person in Bihar when it crossed back for a few days and then again returned to Jharkhand. In all, 11 people were killed in Jharkhand, mostly belonging to the endangered primitive tribal group- the Paharias. Almost all the victims in Jharkhand were Paharias.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "timeCrawl": "07:05:00", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 46, "amb": false, "textEnd": 61}, {"date": "-03-24", "textStart": 2531, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2539}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8755663", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Sports", "id": 561, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "id": 879, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

As per records maintained by the forest department, the pachyderm has trampled 11 people to death in the district.\n\nThe rogue elephant's presence in the vicinity has sparked panic in the nearby villages. The Paharia tribe, whose people live on the hillier regions of the terrain, had earlier approached the foresters to take action against the elephant.\n\nIn a telephonic conversatuion with TOI, chief wildlife warden Lal Ratnakar Singh, who has been camping in Sahibganj for the last few days, said over phone, \"We have a team of experts and hunters here with us.

As per estimates, 60 humans are crushed to death by elephants in the state every year.

elephants.\n\nThe last census of the African elephants revealed a bittersweet story of conservation.\n\nIt is the typical glass half-full or half-empty scenario punctuated by bright spots where the population is healthy and growing, as well as red zones where the elephant existence is endangered.\n\nThe African Elephant Status Report 2016 published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature showed Kenya had Africa's fourth-largest population, estimated at 22,809. The population is stable, with some saying the number is higher but certainly less than 30,000.\n\nOne statistic that sticks out is the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 elephants poached every year.\n\nThough this number is only part of the African elephant story, it is alarming and puts this endangered species top on the priority list of conservationists.\n\nBotswana has Africa's highest jumbo population, estimated at 131,626. The country has been kind to elephants. Some scientists feel that Botswana probably has more elephants than it can carry.\n\nPOPULATION DECLINE\n\nZimbabwe has the second highest population at 82,630. That figure, however, is six per cent down from the last count.\n\nTanzania has 50,433 elephants. The figure could have been higher but for a population decline of 60 per cent in five years.\n\nConservationists seek to know if there are any factors that can predict whether a country would be good to wildlife.\n\nThe general conclusion appears to be that neither size, choice of political governance structure or regional location seems to be ironclad predictors. Data suggests there are lots of possibilities.\n\nCountries with large or recovering elephant populations have invested in good laws but most importantly, seem to be implementing the laws in form of anti-poaching and improved prosecutions and sentencing. Kenya, South Africa and Botswana fall in this category.\n\nNamibia is fifth with 22,754 elephants, followed by Zambia (21,967). The country has witnessed substantial decline in numbers along the Zambezi River, but other areas have been stable or increasing.\n\nIn sixth place is South Africa, with 18,841 jumbos. It is very stable.\n\nThe major elephant population in Kruger National Park has increased substantially.\n\nStill in southern Africa, Mozambique comes next with 10,884 elephants.\n\nThe country, however, recorded a decline of 53 per cent in five years.\n\nPOACHING\n\nThe W-Arli-Pendjari Complex that spans the border areas of three West African countries -- Niger, Burkina Faso and Benin -- comes in eighth, with 8,953 elephants. Don't sneer at that, it is worth a toast because it represents a doubling of population since 2003.\n\nSouth Sudan is ninth with 7,103, followed by Gabon (7,058), Cameroon (6,830) and Congo Republic (6,050).\n\nThirteenth is Uganda. Again, at 4,923 you would say it can't hold a candle to Zimbabwe. However, that represents a head-turning increase of nearly 600 per cent since the country's 1970s-80s poaching decade, when the population plummeted to less than 800.\n\nIn the 14th position is Angola, with 3,395 elephants -- a number that has been rising since 2005.\n\nAfrica's second-largest country after Algeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, takes the 15th position. Though one could say it has a lot of room for elephants, it recorded just 1,794 of them.\n\nSince 2010, it has seen the second-fastest elephant population decline in the world.\n\nPOSITIVE TRENDS\n\nMalawi is 16th with 1,307 elephants -- reporting positive trends in two parks. Much bigger than Malawi in size, Ethiopia is next with 1,017 animals.\n\nThe country has recorded an unexpectedly large elephant population in the Omo Valley.\n\nAll this suggests that Africa can and has the ability to conserve its wildlife.\n\nBut it also points to challenges ahead.\n\nAfrica has the world's youngest and fastest growing population. Providing food, jobs and decent incomes is the continent's most pressing challenge. Where is the place of wildlife in this new Africa?\n\nA new conversation is needed on the role of conservation in nation-building.

Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority rangers were called and they shot and killed the raging elephant.\n\nPolice confirmed that Kufandada, worked at the Victoria Falls tourist company, Adventure Zone, for more then 10 years. Kufandada's son, Shepherd said his father's death was a \"great shock\" as he was the only member of the family with a job.\n\nBrent Williamson, who owns and runs Adventure Zone said he was also \"shocked\" at the turn of events as his company has been providing elephant rides for several years. He said he spoke with \"deep regret...that our domesticated elephant bull, Mbanje charged at one of our staff which resulted in one of our guides losing his life.\"\n\nHe said Kufandada was a most \"respected\" staff member who worked for the company for 11 years. Williamson said Mbanje originally came from the National Parks culling programme.\n\nAdventure Zone owned two elephants and the surviving one who lived alongside Mbanje, is a cow, Nkanyezi, who is 28-years-old.\n\nGlynnis Vaughan, chief inspector of the Zimbabwe National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ZNSPCA disputes that African elephants are ever \"domesticated.\" She said: \"Captured elephants which were used by several tourist companies have killed quite a few people in recent years.\n\n\"We should not be surprised when there are tragedies after elephants are captured in the wild when they are young, and taken from their families. Teaching a young elephant to get on to its knees so that people can mount it is vicious, it's cruel.\"\n\nZNSPCA went to court more then 10 years ago and successfully prosecuted an elephant capturer and a major tourist company in Victoria Falls which was buying young elephants to domesticate them for rides for tourists.\n\nSeveral large companies in Victoria Falls still provide rides for tourists on their elephants most of which were captured and taken from their families.\n\nTragically another two elephants, which roamed around provincial capital, Mutare, in eastern Zimbabwe, were shot dead today by government rangers after they killed a policeman last week.\n\nZimbabwe has tens of thousands of elephants, mostly in the west and the south, more then its wild life areas can cope with given many recent droughts and because poachers have made huge parts of north eastern Zimbabwe hostile territory for elephants.\n\nIn the last few years bankrupt Zimbabwe has exported scores of young elephants to China which were captured by the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority on behalf of several Chinese safari parks.

The population of elephants has declined by nearly 10% or 3,000 in the last five years. The government, however, claims the reduction is mainly on account of a more scientific count this time.\n\nPreliminary results of the 2017 elephant census will be released by Harsh Vardhan, Union minister for environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) on Saturday on the occasion of World Elephant Day, launched in 2012 to draw attention to the plight of Asian and African elephants.\n\n\"Compared to the 2012 census, when population of elephants was estimated to be around 30,000, this time it is coming out to be just over 27,000. The reduction is, however, due to the scientific methods adopted during this exercise,\" said a top MoEFCC official, who did not want to be named.\n\n\"But these are preliminary results. Final results will come in the next 2-3 months,\" the official added.\n\nThe exercise to count India's national heritage animal numbers was started by the Project Elephant division of the environment ministry along with state forest departments in November 2016 and completed in May this year.\n\nThe official explained that the numbers have fallen because scientific methods have been used to estimate the population -- which was not the case in previous estimations.\n\n\"In this estimation, we have used techniques like dung decay method, block count method, elephant distribution mapping and water hole count technique,\" the official explained.\n\nIn 2012, the elephant population was estimated at around 30,000 (29,391-30,711) and in 2007 it was estimated at about 27,670 (27,657-27,682).\n\nAs per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the population of Asian elephants, an endangered species, was about was 41,410-52,345. Of that, India alone accounts for nearly 60% (26,390-30,770).\n\nWildlife activists have welcomed the use of scientific methods.\n\n\"The 2012 census figure of 30,000 elephants was always under the scanner. This time government has collaborated with scientific institutes and used scientific methods to estimate the population of elephants. Now we have a slightly more realistic figure and thus planning for their conservation can improve,\" said Sandeep Kumar Tiwari, programme manager, IUCN-SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group, an international body of scientists and experts concerned with the study, monitoring, management, and conservation of Asian Elephants.\n\n\"However, the concerns regarding elephant habitats and their population remains and government will need to address them,\" Tiwari added.\n\nAlthough elephants are worshipped in India, human-elephant conflict has increased in the country and has emerged as one of the concern areas for the authorities over the past few years. The primary reason for human-elephant conflict is the loss and degradation of wildlife habitats, increasing the chances of wild animals leaving their habitat and encountering people.\n\nAs per official numbers, in last four years, one human life was lost every day due to human-elephant conflict. A total of 1465 humans have been killed in the last four years (2013-14-2016-17).\n\nGovernments, both at the centre and in the states, have been making efforts to address the issue, but due to the huge pressure for development, natural habitats have suffered. They have even used methods like beehives and chilli fences to prevent human-elephant conflict.", "timeCrawl": "19:32:00", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 33, "date": "2017-08-12", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 42}, {"date": "2016-11-", "textStart": 1137, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1150}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8688820", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "id": 93, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

elephant census titled 'Synchronised elephant population estimation India 2017' released on Saturday.\n\nIt is a \"healthy\" population, according to experts with no major fluctuation seen over years but human-elephant conflicts are definitely on the rise.\n\nThe elephant census is also showing an interesting but worrying trend. Many states that never reported any elephant population in previous census have reported elephants, which indicates a gradual expansion in elephant area.\n\nThis is of concern because it may lead to more human-elephant conflicts if these states fail to support the population with enough forest cover and adequate habitat for them to settle.\n\nElephant populations have been reported for the first time from Manipur, Mizoram, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the Andaman and Nicobars.\n\nAccording to elephant expert R Sukumar, this gradual expansion could be due to disturbance in their original areas or due to climate change impacts like temperature and precipitation change. This expansion has been happening gradually over 30 years, he added.\n\nThere were 415 human deaths in conflicts cases in 2015-16 and 245 deaths in 2016- February 2017, according to data released by the environment ministry on Saturday.\n\nAbout 45 elephants died in 2015-16 and 21 died in 2016-February 2017 due to electrocution. The census data shows Karnataka has the highest elephant population at 6,049 followed by Assam at 5,719 elephants. Even though the census data shows a decline in overall elephant population from 29391-30711 in 2012 to 27312 in 2017, experts said this was only due to a difference in the counting method.\n\nLast year, some southern states had adopted both direct count and indirect count method for the census to arrive at more reliable population estimates.\n\nIn the direct method, forest blocks of 4 to 5 sq kms are sampled by state forest department staff. They sample about 30 to 50% blocks under their jurisdiction and extrapolate the findings.\n\nThe indirect method helps validate the direct method by mapping elephant distributions in a GIS domain, analyzing data from indirect dung count method and compiling more accurate population structure data from photographs etc.\n\nThis year only the \"direct count\" method has been adopted for all states, so the numbers appear to be lower than 2012's census data.\n\nFor example, in 2012 Kerala reported 5942-6422 elephants based on the indirect method but only 2735 elephants based on the direct method.\n\n\"We have a healthy elephant population in India. There is no question of a decline. In fact, there may have been a slight increase. The indirect count method would give us a more accurate picture but there was no time to complete that. A more detailed report on elephant numbers will come out later this year. The real challenges or concerns for us is whether elephants are moving to other forest areas (from their own habitat) increasing the potential for conflicts with humans,\" said R Sukumar, elephant expert and head of Asian Nature Conservation Foundation (ANCF).\n\n\"The gradual expansion of elephant area is worrying. They may be coming out due to disturbance or climate change induced factors. For example, in 1983 following a major drought herds of elephants moved from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh where elephants have been absent for over two centuries. Such expansion may be difficult to manage in future,\" Sukumar told TOI.", "timeCrawl": "18:12:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-02-", "textStart": 1236, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1249}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8827188", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "id": 690, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "id": 784, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But others like her are living out isolated lives in zoos across Japan.\n\nMiyako is a female Asian elephant who has lived without other elephants since arriving at Japan's Utsunomiya Zoo, just outside of Tokyo, 44 years ago when she was six months old. She is kept in a small, concrete enclosure near the zoo's amusement park, says Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and elephant expert based in Oxford, England.\n\n\"She's been in that place her whole life, with no other elephants and nowhere to move,\" he says.\n\nLindsay observed Miyako earlier this year, when he spent two weeks visiting 14 zoos believed to be the majority in Japan keeping elephants in isolation. He summarized the conditions of the animals and their surroundings in a new report released today, on the eve of World Elephant Day.\n\nFive elephants have been alone their entire lives, the report says. Eight became isolated after their companions died or were moved, and one rejoined her previous companion but had to be kept in a separate enclosure. \"The elephants were essentially psychotic, desperate to interact with people in some cases, turning their backs to people in other cases,\" Lindsay says.\n\nThe catalyst for his Japan trip was an elephant he never met, a female named Hanako, who had lived alone in cramped quarters in Tokyo's Inokashira Park Zoo for more than 60 years. She became the focus of public attention in the fall of 2015. That's when a visitor to the zoo, Ulara Nakagawa, wrote a blog post about Hanako and started a petition calling on the elephant to be moved to a sanctuary in Thailand, her home country.\n\n\"Totally alone in a small, barren, cement enclosure with absolutely NO comfort or stimulation provided, she just stood there almost lifeless -- like a figurine,\" Nakagawa wrote.\n\nThe petition garnered almost 470,000 signatures, and news stories about Hanako's plight swept the Internet. But the zoo deemed it too risky to move the elderly elephant, and a few months later the so-called \"loneliest elephant in the world\" died at the age of 69.\n\nFor Nakagawa, Hanako's death marked the beginning of a larger effort to help companionless zoo elephants in Japan. She teamed up with Zoocheck, a Canada-based nonprofit devoted to animal protection, and started a grassroots campaign called Elephants in Japan. And she recruited Lindsay to review how elephants -- highly social and intelligent animals -- are doing at zoos in Japan, which has no standards for how to keep them in captivity.\n\n\"This new campaign is in [Hanako's] memory, to make sure that the other elephants in Japan don't have to live out the same life she had to,\" Nakagawa says. As for why she chose to examine lonely elephants in Japan when it's hardly the only country where zoos keep them, she explains, \"we had to start somewhere.\"\n\nMany of the 14 solitary elephants Lindsay observed, including Miyako, were exposed to conditions he found substandard, such as too-small enclosures and a lack of stimulation.\n\nBut, he says, Miyako topped the list as the one with the most heartbreaking life. He watched her pacing back and forth and noted that she would repeatedly bite down on a metal bar in the enclosure, behaviors that signal psychological stress. \"I've never seen that before,\" he says.\n\nMiyako's life bears no resemblance to that of Asian elephants in the wild, where females live in tightly knit groups with as many as 50 companions, and males often associate with other males once they reach sexual maturity and leave the family unit. Even when elephants aren't hanging out with their pals, studies show that they can still remember them and communicate with them through smell and sound. (Read more about elephant vocalizations and how you too can 'speak' like an elephant).\n\n\"The social aspect of an elephant's life is the most important to its well-being, and we would be concerned for the psychological welfare of any elephants kept on their own,\" says Georgina Allen of Wild Welfare, a nonprofit dedicated to improving conditions for captive animals. Allen wasn't affiliated with the Elephants in Japan report.\n\nIn addition to needing companionship, Asian elephants require a lot of space, ranging over areas as large as 230 square miles in search of food or mates. Known for their smarts, they grieve and show other emotions, such as joy and anger, and are even capable of \"aha\" moments, such as figuring out that a step stool can help them reach food.\n\nAnimal welfare advocates say elephants' intelligence make it all the more detrimental for them when they're kept by themselves in barren areas. Although Lindsay found Miyako's situation particularly bleak, hers was by no means the only sad case, he says.\n\nHe also found:\n\nTeru, an Asian elephant who has been kept alone at Kofu City Yuki Park Zoo since 2000. The 38-year-old has no stimulation in her concrete outdoor enclosure and was seen swaying repeatedly from side to side and bobbing her head. Himeko, a 40-year-old Asian elephant who has been isolated at the Himeji City Zoo since her arrival in 1994. She is confined indoors for 18 hours a day, is forced to perform for visitors, and was observed swaying for long periods and standing in her own urine. Izumi, an Asian elephant who died at age 62 soon after Lindsay saw her in Kiryugaoka Zoo. She had lived alone since 1964 in a small dark indoor stall and outdoor area with no shade.\n\nLindsay deemed only four of the 14 zoos as \"improved,\" meaning they'd at least made attempts to add innovative features, enlarge enclosures, and make other enhancements. The remaining zoos fell shorter, with some appearing to have gone without updates since their construction in the 1950s.\n\nMost zoo associations, the report notes, agree that elephants should have enough room to move around, forage, and have the chance to interact with other elephants. The American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, an accrediting agency that has developed guidelines for keeping elephants, recommends grouping together no fewer than three females, two males, or three of mixed gender.\n\nSome zoos have even questioned the feasibility of holding elephants in captivity at all, given their complex needs. At least 44 zoos worldwide have either closed their elephant exhibits or signaled an intention to shut them down, the report notes.\n\nBut the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums hasn't yet developed best practices, according to Lindsay, and it doesn't routinely monitor zoos to ensure that the animals' welfare needs are met. (At press time, the executive director of JAZA had not yet responded to a request for comment).\n\nLindsay hopes Japan will develop such standards. In the immediate future, he urges the zoos with solitary elephants to relocate them, if they're healthy enough, to facilities where they at least will have the option to socialize with others -- perhaps even to hang out in the dirt, lock trunks, and splash about in a pool:", "timeCrawl": "17:14:00", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8821415", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "id": 237, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "id": 313, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 25}}

Over the course of the day, this massive ice sculpture will gradually melt, symbolising the alarming rate in which African elephants are continuing to disappear at the hands of poachers.\n\nThe event is one of many being organised across the world on August 12 to celebrate World Elephant Day. It is part of the campaign #DontLetThemDisappear launched by Amarula Trust in partnership with the Kenyan NGO WildlifeDirect to raise global awareness of the plight of Africa's elephants.\n\nTo reinforce the message, bottles of Amarula liqueur will be released for sale without the iconic elephant on the label. The trust will donate $1 for every bottle sold between now and the end of the year to support anti-poaching efforts.\n\nInitiatives like this are vital to focus the world's attention on elephants. Across Africa, it is estimated that one elephant is killed by poachers every 15 minutes. The global demand for ivory is still the principal driving force that is pushing elephants to the brink of extinction.\n\nAs recently expressed by one of Kenya's foremost supporters of elephants, the First Lady of Kenya, Margaret Kenyatta, only a sustained global effort can save them: Elephants have lived in coexistence with human beings in Africa for millions of years. They are part of our natural environment our culture, our identity and our heritage. We are alarmed that trade in ivory in other parts of the world threaten the very existence of this majestic species and we call on all citizens of the world to celebrate World Elephant Day on 12th August, by renewing their commitment to end trade in ivory.\n\nThe only place that it belongs is on the elephant. Let's play our part in keeping them alive. The event in Union Square is intended to highlight the critical role that America and other consuming countries have to play, both by reducing its own ivory consumption and by building pressure for a global ban on ivory trade.\n\nOn an African level, poachers can only be defeated by adopting a continentwide approach. Otherwise, when controls are tightened up in one country, poachers will simply relocate to neighbouring countries to continue their gruesome work.\n\nAnti-poaching efforts, like other actions to protect the environment, will have to be sustained on a timescale that is much longer than the election cycles in democratic countries.\n\nElections are a reminder to defenders of wildlife of just how fragile our 'victories' can turn out to be. Americans will not need to be reminded how, in just a few weeks, Donald Trump has not only reneged on the global climate change treaty but also set about dismantling domestic environmental protection measures that took decades to put in place.\n\nHere in Africa, it is not only the outcome but also the process of elections that gives cause for concern. All too often elections take place in a climate of uncertainty that allows unscrupulous people to plunder the natural environment, without fear of redress, with dire consequences for elephants and other wildlife.\n\nDuring the current election campaign in Kenya, armed invaders have wreaked havoc in some parts of Laikipia, undoing years of patient wildlife conservation work. Not a single arrest has been made.\n\nAfrican elephants are the largest terrestrial animal left on the planet. They live in close-knit families, and develop lasting friendships. They mourn their dead, meet up for reunions, and go to extraordinary lengths to protect other, young and vulnerable elephants from harm. To know elephants is to fall in love with them.\n\nIt seems unthinkable that wild elephants should disappear. How can we make sure it doesn't happen? Care for the natural environment should be understood as a moral duty, as it was in the past by cultures with close bonds with nature. Our ancestors recognised springs, trees, animals, forests, reefs and caves as sacred and considered desecrating them to be a sin.\n\nMost people in the modern world are only dimly aware of how our destinies are intertwined with those of wild creatures and natural resources. But science has revealed that modern humans are no less dependent on the natural world than 'primitive' societies. It has debunked the delusion of 'human exceptionalism': the idea that humans can somehow escape the constraints that nature imposes on other species. Once we acknowledge that our natural heritage should be protected at all costs it is obvious that this truth should transcend politics and differences among political parties.\n\nNon-political organisations such as businesses and civil society organisations have a key role to play in maintaining this long-term vision in the face of political short-termism.\n\nIn Africa, this understanding should inform our vision of national development. People in developed countries are rich in many ways. But visitors from developed countries who spend large amounts of money for a few moments in the company of elephants are searching for something that their societies, for all their material wealth, cannot provide.\n\nWe in Africa have the opportunity to map out a different path. We can devise ways of creating wealth that leave our natural environment intact, as a continuing source of wonder and inspiration for future generations. Support for this vision came last month from an unlikely quarter.\n\nSpeaking in Nairobi on his first visit to Africa, Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire, argued passionately that Africa should not try to be like China. The founder of the e-commerce giant Ali Baba might have been expected to argue that Africa should go for growth at any cost.\n\nInstead, he urged Africa to learn from the mistakes of developed economies and develop its own model of development, using technology to protect our unique wildlife and the environment: Where else can you find elephants roaming around except in Africa? Where else can you find fresh air that is not polluted except here? When I landed here and I was hit by fresh air, I understood why people come here. It's a business opportunity, so leverage that.\n\nThis statement from one of the world's most successful businessmen underlines what a terrible mistake it would be to allow development to destroy our natural heritage.

Wildlife Direct and a campaigner for elephants and wildlife.\n\nToday a life-sized ice sculpture of an African elephant will be placed in Union Square in Downtown Manhattan. Over the course of the day, this massive ice sculpture will gradually melt, symbolizing the alarming rate in which African elephants are continuing to disappear at the hands of poachers.\n\nThe event is one of many being organised across the world on 12 August to celebrate World Elephant Day. It is part of the campaign #DontLetThemDisappear launched by Amarula Trust in partnership with the Kenyan NGO WildlifeDirect to raise global awareness of the plight of Africa's elephants.\n\nTo reinforce the message, bottles of Amarula liqueur will be released for sale without the iconic elephant on the label. The trust will donate $1 for every bottle sold between now and the end of the year to support anti-poaching efforts.\n\nInitiatives like this are vital to focus the world's attention on elephants. Across Africa, it is estimated that one elephant is killed by poachers every 15 minutes. The global demand for ivory is still the principal driving force that is pushing elephants to the brink of extinction.\n\nAs recently expressed by one of Kenya's foremost supporters of elephants, the First Lady of Kenya, Margaret Kenyatta, only a sustained global effort can save them:\n\nElephants have lived in coexistence with human beings in Africa for millions of years. They are part of our natural environment our culture, our identity and our heritage. We are alarmed that trade in ivory in other parts of the world threaten the very existence of this majestic species and we call on all citizens of the world to celebrate World Elephant Day on 12th August, by renewing their commitment to end trade in ivory. The only place that it belongs is on the elephant. Let's play our part in keeping them alive.\n\nThe event in Union Square is intended to highlight the critical role that America and other consuming countries have to play, both by reducing its own ivory consumption and by building pressure for a global ban on ivory trade.\n\nOn an African level, poachers can only be defeated by adopting a continent-wide approach. Otherwise, when controls are tightened up in one country, poachers will simply relocate to neighbouring countries to continue their gruesome work.\n\nAnti-poaching efforts, like other actions to protect the environment, will have to be sustained on a timescale that is much longer than the election cycles in democratic countries. Elections are a reminder to defenders of wildlife of just how fragile our 'victories' can turn out to be.\n\nAmericans will not need to be reminded how, in just a few weeks, Donald Trump has not only reneged on the global climate change treaty but also set about dismantling domestic environmental protection measures that took decades to put in place.\n\nHere in Africa, it is not only the outcome but also the process of elections that gives cause for concern. All too often elections take place in a climate of uncertainty that allows unscrupulous people to plunder the natural environment, without fear of redress, with dire consequences for elephants and other wildlife.\n\nDuring the current election campaign in Kenya, armed invaders have wreaked havoc in some parts of Laikipia, undoing years of patient wildlife conservation work. Not a single arrest has been made.\n\nAfrican elephants are the largest terrestrial animal left on the planet. They live in close-knit families, and develop lasting friendships. They mourn their dead, meet up for reunions, and go to extraordinary lengths to protect other, young and vulnerable elephants from harm. To know elephants is to fall in love with them.\n\nIt seems unthinkable that wild elephants should disappear. How can we make sure it doesn't happen?\n\nCare for the natural environment should be understood as a moral duty, as it was in the past by cultures with close bonds with nature. Our ancestors recognized springs, trees, animals, forests, reefs and caves as sacred and considered desecrating them to be a sin.\n\nMost people in the modern world are only dimly aware of how our destinies are intertwined with those of wild creatures and natural resources. But science has revealed that modern humans are no less dependent on the natural world than 'primitive' societies. It has debunked the delusion of 'human exceptionalism': the idea that humans can somehow escape the constraints that nature imposes on other species.\n\nOnce we acknowledge that our natural heritage should be protected at all costs it is obvious that this truth should transcend politics and differences among political parties. Non-political organisations such as businesses and civil society organisations have a key role to play in maintaining this long-term vision in the face of political short-termism.\n\nIn Africa, this understanding should inform our vision of national development. People in developed countries are rich in many ways. But visitors from developed countries who spend large amounts of money for a few moments in the company of elephants are searching for something that their societies, for all their material wealth, cannot provide.\n\nWe in Africa have the opportunity to map out a different path. We can devise ways of creating wealth that leave our natural environment intact, as a continuing source of wonder and inspiration for future generations.\n\nSupport for this vision came last month from an unlikely quarter. Speaking in Nairobi on his first visit to Africa, Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire, argued passionately that Africa should not try to be like China.\n\nThe founder of the e-commerce giant Ali Baba might have been expected to argue that Africa should go for growth at any cost. Instead, he urged Africa to learn from the mistakes of developed economies and develop its own model of development, using technology to protect our unique wildlife and the environment:\n\nWhere else can you find elephants roaming around except in Africa? Where else can you find fresh air that is not polluted except here? When I landed here and I was hit by fresh air, I understood why people come here. It's a business opportunity, so leverage that.\n\nThis statement from one of the world's most successful businessmen underlines what a terrible mistake it would be to allow development to destroy our natural heritage. It should also remind us that Africa has a unique role to play in solving global conservation challenges.\n\nThis is one reason why the collaboration on World Elephant Day between two African organizations, Amarula and WildlifeDirect, is significant. We, as Africans, must be ready to assume responsibility for mobilising global support to protect our elephants and defeat the illegal wildlife trade.", "timeCrawl": "04:04:00", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 462, "date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 453}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8740725", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

population estimation India 2017' released on Saturday.\n\nIt is a \"healthy\" population, according to experts with no major fluctuation seen over years but human-elephant conflicts are definitely on the rise.\n\nThe elephant census is also showing an interesting but worrying trend. Many states that never reported any elephant population in previous census have reported elephants, which indicates a gradual expansion in elephant area.\n\nThis is of concern because it may lead to more human-elephant conflicts if these states fail to support the population with enough forest cover and adequate habitat for them to settle.\n\nElephant populations have been reported for the first time from Manipur, Mizoram, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the Andaman and Nicobars.\n\nAccording to elephant expert R Sukumar, this gradual expansion could be due to disturbance in their original areas or due to climate change impacts like temperature and precipitation change. This expansion has been happening gradually over 30 years, he added.\n\nThere were 415 human deaths in conflicts cases in 2015-16 and 245 deaths in 2016- February 2017, according to data released by the environment ministry on Saturday.\n\nAbout 45 elephants died in 2015-16 and 21 died in 2016-February 2017 due to electrocution. The census data shows Karnataka has the highest elephant population at 6,049 followed by Assam at 5,719 elephants. Even though the census data shows a decline in overall elephant population from 29391-30711 in 2012 to 27312 in 2017, experts said this was only due to a difference in the counting method.\n\nLast year, some southern states had adopted both direct count and indirect count method for the census to arrive at more reliable population estimates.\n\nIn the direct method, forest blocks of 4 to 5 sq kms are sampled by state forest department staff. They sample about 30 to 50% blocks under their jurisdiction and extrapolate the findings.\n\nThe indirect method helps validate the direct method by mapping elephant distributions in a GIS domain, analyzing data from indirect dung count method and compiling more accurate population structure data from photographs etc.\n\nThis year only the \"direct count\" method has been adopted for all states, so the numbers appear to be lower than 2012's census data.\n\nFor example, in 2012 Kerala reported 5942-6422 elephants based on the indirect method but only 2735 elephants based on the direct method.\n\n\"We have a healthy elephant population in India. There is no question of a decline. In fact, there may have been a slight increase. The indirect count method would give us a more accurate picture but there was no time to complete that. A more detailed report on elephant numbers will come out later this year. The real challenges or concerns for us is whether elephants are moving to other forest areas (from their own habitat) increasing the potential for conflicts with humans,\" said R Sukumar, elephant expert and head of Asian Nature Conservation Foundation (ANCF).\n\n\"The gradual expansion of elephant area is worrying. They may be coming out due to disturbance or climate change induced factors. For example, in 1983 following a major drought herds of elephants moved from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh where elephants have been absent for over two centuries. Such expansion may be difficult to manage in future,\" Sukumar told TOI.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "timeCrawl": "18:10:00", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-02-", "textStart": 1236, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1249}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8826966", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "id": 690, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "id": 784, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The indirect method includes estimation through elephant dung analysis.\n\nThe minister also launched a 15-month-long campaign -- Gaj Yatra -- to raise awareness about the shrinking space for India's wild elephants and their corridors, a probable reason for decline in their population. The Wildlife Trust of India, which will coordinate the yatra, has mapped a total of 101 elephant corridors.\n\nOf 24 states surveyed for the exercise, only eight reported an increase in elephant numbers. Tamil Nadu saw the biggest dip of 1,254 elephants, followed by Karnataka (439).\n\nThe report also highlighted the increasing elephant-human conflict with their habitat shrinking in most states in which over 100 tuskers and 660 people have died since 2015.", "timeCrawl": "18:41:00", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8831367", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The elephant population is concentrated largely in the Southern region and Northeast region, making up for over 22,000 elephants. Karnataka alone is home to 6,049 pachyderms, the highest in any state. Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Dr Harsh Vardhan released the preliminary results on Saturday, World Elephant Day.\n\nThe first cut estimate of elephant population is based only on direct count method, which involves direct sighting and counting of elephants in sample grid blocks, officials associated with the exercise said. Finer details on densities in specific habitats and regions are awaited in the final report. Though the estimation exercise is to undergo complete analysis of statistics, the preliminary numbers are lesser by 3,000 compared to the 2012 estimation. The 2012 estimation had found out that there were a little over 30,000 elephants across 16 states.\n\nProfessor Raman Sukumar, Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru and a lead collaborator on the project, however, said, \"The current numbers should not compared with the 2012 population estimate as the methods were different. We adopted a uniform methods this time while the previous exercise saw states using different methods.\"\n\nHe added, \"We have a stable population. But the real challenge is to maintain safe and clear passages for elephants. There are 101 critical elephant passages in the country.\n\nThe 2017 elephant estimation exercise was carried out using the direct and indirect method, between November 2016 and May 2017. The direct method involved direct counting of elephants using the sample block counting, in grids of 4-6 sq.kms each. Additionally, elephants are also counted at spots such as salt licks and water holes. The dung-decay method, though, falls in the indirect category. As elephants are difficult to spot in dense forests, their dung comes in handy, which is found more commonly. Dung piles were assessed in a period of three-four months to study its decay rate. As per studies, elephants defecate 15-16 times a day on an average and this data is used in the mathematical formula to estimate elephant density.\n\nThe dung density figure is multiplied by its decay rate and divided by the normal defecation rate.

He says it's a very real possibility the animals go extinct in the wild within his life time.\n\n\"The biggest threat to elephants,\" Montgomery says, \"it is humans.

He suggests people should support organizations with ecologically friendly principals and to buy coffee that is shade grown.\n\nWorld Elephant Day is August 12.

By inputting a phrase by voice, text, or emoji, users can see a video of an elephant communicating the same greeting or emotion back to them, which can then be shared with others.\n\nBy typing \"hello,\" for example, the translation includes an elephant call used to greet one another. Saying \"I love you\" or \"xoxo\" will play an elephant call used to express love or affection. Other human words and phrases like \"beautiful,\" \"funny,\" \"stressed out,\" and \"let's go\" can also be translated. (Read \"What Elephant Calls Mean: A User's Guide\")\n\nThe new website -- which launches just in time for World Elephant Day on Aug. 12 -- was created to help raise awareness of the elephants' plight.\n\nElephants continue to be in danger of extinction due to poaching and habitat loss. There were over 10 million African elephants in the early 20th century, but it's estimated that there are now less than 400,000, according to the Great Elephant Census. By 2025, scientists predict there could be only 190,000 African elephants left.\n\n\"As human population increases, this leads to more conflict and elephant deaths,\" says Joyce Poole, elephant conservationist and co-founder of ElephantVoices. \"The elephant population has improved a bit, but I think people should know that it's still a problem,\" adds Poole, who is also a National Geographic explorer.\n\nPoole, who's spent the last 40 years researching elephant communication and behavior, said elephant conservation is crucial for helping preserve the species' complex communications.

Restoration is easier said than done, but we want to effect a change with active involvement of local communities,\" she said.\n\nReferring to the successful relocation of a village in Karbi Anglong for restoring an important elephant corridor on the Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong landscape three years back, Mirza said that the campaign would strive to replicate the successful conservation model in areas needing similar intervention.\n\n\"We will engage with local communities and also assist them with livelihood options for freeing elephant corridors,\" she said.\n\nIn Assam and other parts of the Northeast, elephant habitat and corridors are shrinking drastically in the face of growing encroachment, tree-felling and commercial and industrial activities. This has also led to a spurt in the man-elephant conflict that has been taking a large toll on both elephant and human lives.\n\n\"Corridors apart, the need to save elephant habitat has never been as urgent as it is today. The problem is worsened by the fact that many elephant habitats fall outside protected forests like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, rendering those more vulnerable to encroachment and deforestation. We are for a better mechanism that can ensure protection to reserved forests as well,\" Mirza, who starred in several Bollywood blockbusters and was also a winner of Miss Asia Pacific Pageant, said.\n\nPointing out that the elephant had been a part of Indian folklore and culture, Mirza said that empowerment of communities living near elephant habitats could help mitigate the man-elephant conflict and protect elephant habitat.\n\n\"WTI has been working towards this for over a decade-and-a-half through 'Right of Passage - National Elephant Corridors Project', and we want to take it to the next level with Gaja Yatra,\" she said.\n\nAnother crucial aspect, she added, is that Gaja Yatra would be in the form of a national movement and also encompass people who were not necessarily into conservation.\n\n\"We want to bring every person into the fold of this campaign.

As these magnificent creatures increasingly come under various threats, from economic development to poaching, tomorrow is a reminder to do what we can to protect and conserve them and their natural habitat. The organizations that have partnered on World Elephant Day since 2012 also ask citizens to experience this family of pachyderms by interacting with them only in humane, sustainable and non-exploitive environments.\n\nLast month, the NGO World Animal Protection issued a report that in great detail described how thousands of elephants worldwide, especially across Asia, are exploited and cruelly treated in deplorable conditions. Those elephants you may have ridden in a trek in northern Thailand or during a safari in Sri Lanka are most likely, in World Animal Protection's assessment, treated \"appallingly.\"\n\nNow more tour companies and travel sites are pushing back and doing their part to educate citizens about the cruelty behind elephants used by the tourism sector. Intrepid Travel, for example, severed all ties with elephant ride operators three years ago. TripAdvisor announced last fall they would phase out sales for any attraction in which humans can come in close contact with wildlife, including elephants.\n\nMeanwhile, more needs to be done to stop the relentless threats elephants confront. Drones, for example, have been used in an attempt to ward off poaching.\n\nThe destruction of elephants and their habitats not only is pushing these animals to the brink of extinction, but also threatens the way of life of local citizens who could otherwise co-exist with them. One study has suggested that across southern African countries, eco-tourism opportunities offered by elephants could help more communities thrive. And a French NGO, Des \u00c9l\u00e9phants & Des Hommes, has worked since 2003 to help humans and elephants live together for both environmental and economic developments.\n\nTime is running out, however.

Till August this year, a staggering 17 jumbos had died in the state which works out to nearly two elephants every 30 days during the intervening eight months, according to the Heritage Animal Taskforce (HAT), an NGO, which has championed the cause of pachyderms. Besides, 179 wild elephants had died of various causes, the NGO said quoting various reports. There is also a major discrepancy in the report on elephant population submitted by the government in the Supreme Court two years ago which had put it at 609. However, this has come down to about 540 now as per the latest figures.\n\nV K Venkatachalam, secretary, Elephant Task Force (ETF), said the condition of captive elephants is really pathetic. This is despite the jumbo owners minting money, especially, during the festival season. The foresters and vets in the Animal Husbandry Department are complicit in the atrocities perpetrated on the animals, he said. Several of the dead jumbos had been victims of ill-treatment by mahouts. The animals are forced to remain on their feet for hours which takes a heavy toll on their health. Feeding processed food is also a major villain since it gets stuck in the animal's gut.\n\nMost of the captive elephants which died belonged to the 25-40 age bracket. But there is no mechanism to find how the death occurred. The postmortem is just an eyewash, Venkatachalam said. In many cases the true reason for the death is kept under wraps to protect the owners, who could be fined, he said. Though the Director, Project Elephant, had called for details of elephants which died this year the state government refused to play ball.\n\nVenkatachalam said there is a State ETF and District ETF consisting of the Forest Secretary, DFO, representative of the mahout and Chief Veterinarians which should be convened every year. However, since 2015 no meeting had been convened, he said. Even in the wake of disturbing number of elephant deaths, hardly any attempts have been made to deconstruct the issue to get a proper understanding of the actual reasons behind the spate of jumbo deaths.Rajeev Rajan, Chief Conservator of Forests(CCF), Central Circle, said regular checks are conducted to ensure elephants are treated well. Also, stringent action is being initiated in cases of cruelty to the animals. Rajan said attempts to draw parallels with the veterinary care available in the West will be overdrawn since those are evolved societies.\n\n24 elephants died in '16\n\nThe number of elephants that died in the past three years (2016, 2015, 104) was 24, 26 and 14 respectively. According to V K Venkitachalam, general secretary of the Heritage Animal Task Force, almost all the elephants that died during that period were due to prolonged torture. The elephants that died were in the age group 22-48. The average life expectancy of a captive elephant is 80 under normal circumstances, he said.", "timeCrawl": "04:02:00", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8740473", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "id": 574, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Production", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Production", "id": 615, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "id": 684, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Resources and Environment Minister Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar.\n\nHe said the animal distribution in the peninsula is concentrated in Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, Perak, Johor and Negri Sembilan, with the highest elephant population to be found in the National Park in Pahang of about 290 to 631 elephants.\n\nAs a 'keystone' species in the forest ecosystem, Wan Junaidi said

We are hopeful that through this campaign, man-elephant conflicts will reduce,\" the minister said.\n\nAccording to experts, Asian elephants now occupy a meagre 3.5 per cent of their historical range. The vanishing corridors or passages within the forests through which the animal migrates without human disturbance is the biggest stumbling block in the way of conservation.\n\n\"When WTI produced the first edition of 'Right of Passage' in 2005, we had mapped 88 elephant corridors. In this second edition, there are 101, which shows that elephant habitats have become more fragmented,\" said Vivek Menon, adding that the Gaj Yatra campaign aimed to take \"Gajah\" (elephant) to the \"Prajah\" (people).\n\nHe added the Asian elephant was a keystone species on whose broad back so much of India's rich biodiversity rested.\n\n\"We share our country with the largest number of Asian elephants. However, in recent years our wild lands have been steadily destroyed and degraded, posing a serious threat to elephants,\" said Mirza.\n\nShe also participated in a walk and run event organised on the occasion, along with children.\n\n--IANS\n\nkd/nir/bg\n\nSEARCH", "timeCrawl": "15:31:00", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 11, "date": "2017-08-12", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 17}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8810349", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

kids.nationalgeographic.com\n\nAugust 12 is celebrated as World Elephant Day ever since it was established in 2012. Worldwide, Elephants are increasingly under threat from poachers and trophy hunters. The Asian elephant is listed as endangered while the African Bush Elephants are classed as vulnerable. To create awareness about the need to protect this majestic land behemoth, a rally was conducted in the State of Tamil Nadu in India on August 11.\n\nAs reported by The Hindu, B. Ramakrishnan, an assistant professor in wildlife biology, Government Arts College, Udhagamandalam, told the newspaper, \"We wanted to create awareness among the 1,500 students studying in the college on the need to protect elephants.\" B. Ramakrishnan also member of the IUCN Asian Elephant Specialist Group.\n\nAs noted by The Hindu, more than 100 students of the Departments of Zoology and Wildlife Biology of the said Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam, popularly known as Ooty, marched inside the college premises on Friday, wearing elephant masks to create awareness among the college students. They demanded that the elephant population, along with their corridors and habitats be protected.\n\nAlso, Bollywood actress and ambassador of Wildlife Trust of India, Dia Mirza, penned a piece for Times of India, published today, explaining why elephants are vital for our ecosystem and require advocating for the need to keep open elephant corridors in the country.\n\nClearing of forests due to the practice of shifting agriculture has caused habitat loss for elephants in Northeastern Indian states. This type of agriculture is also known to be practised in Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Congo, Madagascar, Bolivia, Sweden and in a natural reserve in Finland.\n\nHabitat loss has led to increasing incidents of man-animal conflicts. NDTV reported that as per government figures, endangered elephants and tigers are reportedly killing one person a day in India. This is happening because vast tracts of forest lands are being cleared every year due to urbanisation, leaving the animals with no choice but to defend their territories violently. In the process, many animals are losing their lives. NDTV also notes that man is killing a leopard a day too, as per latest figures.\n\nAccording to the environment ministry, notes NDTV, 345 tigers and 84 elephants were killed between April 2014 and May 2017. Tito Joseph of the Wildlife Protection Society of India told AFP, \"Rampant killing of wildlife is ongoing in India. Hundreds of leopards, tigers and elephants are killed for their body parts.\" This is also true of other nations like Thailand and African territories where the animals are killed for their ivory tusks.\n\nRecently, an elephant that accidentally strayed from its herd and lost its way had reportedly killed 15 people in the Indian states of Jharkhand and Bihar. Unfortunately, the forest department was not able to tranquilise the animal and had it shot dead on August 11, Hindustan Times reported. The animal was believed to be highly stressed as a result of which it attacked people.\n\nElephants are often killed by trains in India while crossing tracks that are built through forest corridors which have been home to these animals for thousands of years. Then there are cases of physical and psychological abuse for entertainment purposes, which happen all over the world, in many zoos as well as circuses.\n\nIt is therefore good news that children, the future of any nation, are advocating awareness on the need to protect elephants. Also, as reported by The Assam Tribune, a nationwide 15-month awareness-cum-action campaign titled 'Gaja Yatra' is being launched today across India. Initiated by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) in association with the Government of India's Project Elephant and Partners, the goal of this campaign is the same as that of the students of the Ooty Arts College.\n\nWorld Elephant Day was conceived in 2011 by Canadian filmmakers Patricia Sims and Michael Clark and Sivaporn Dardarananda of the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation in Thailand and founded by them the following year.", "timeCrawl": "09:33:00", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "2017-05-", "date": "2014-04-", "textStart": 2381, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2404}, {"textStart": 55, "date": "2017-08-12", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 64}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 473, "date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 464}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8771579", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

A team led by hunter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan from Hyderabad, along with veterinarians, had been camping in the higher reaches of Raj Mahal Hills of Sahibganj for the purpose.\n\nPrincipal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Wildlife, L R Singh, said: \"The team managed to track down the elephant around 6 pm near Banjhi Santhali village in Taljhari Block of Sahibganj district. Two bullets were shot.\"\n\nSingh said it was an unfortunate act but the last resort. \"We tried to tranquilise it. But to do that, you have to come very close to it. One of our veterinary doctors nearly got killed three days ago,\" he said.\n\nAnother option was to dig trenches and trap it. But that too could not be done because of the hilly terrain. Singh said that after it had killed three people, Bihar counterparts had almost declared it 'rogue'.\n\nFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Jharkhand", "timeCrawl": "00:56:00", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 46, "amb": false, "textEnd": 61}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8859265", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas", "id": 654, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It is at that site where the wounded animal had been found nearly two weeks after the incident.\n\nThe explosion had mutilated its jaw bones, teeth, and ripped off a foot long piece of trunk. The animal is being treated at the Elephant Transit Home Udawalawe.\n\nVeterinary surgeon, Dr Malaka Abeywardena told the Sunday Times that even after three days of treatment, there had not been any improvement as of Friday.\n\n\"Due to the damage to the jaw and teeth of the elephant calf it has to take liquid food. It is malnourished and weak making anaesthetised surgery impossible.''\n\nDr Abeywardena said that that the calf would have roamed near Hambantota harbour for over a week after being wounded. The animal's mouth and the side of it's head was infested with maggots.\n\n\"Antibiotics are given twice a day, while saline, energy boosting medicine and vitamins are given regularly,'' he said.\n\nIncidents of elephants being killed by using hakka patas, shooting them or poisoning them are on the rise.\n\nWithin the last five years, from 2012 to 2016 around 1,171 elephants have died out of which only 104 had died due to natural causes, according to the Wildlife Department.\n\nThe survey on the elephant population done in 2011 revealed that the number of elephants in the country around 5,800.\n\nStatistics show that during last year alone 279 elephants were found dead and only 35 of them had died due to natural causes.\n\nDr Tharaka Prasad, director of wildlife health at the Wildlife Department as well as the chief veterinary surgeon, said more deaths take place because of gun shot wounds.\n\nHe said that a tusker and another elephant suffering from gunshot injuries are struggling for their lives in Kala Wewa, Anuradhapura and in Minneriya respectively.\n\n\"Elephants which are shot can only be identified when the animal shows signs of weakness or seen limping towards a pool of water. Its too late then as it is badly infected by that time,'' he said.\n\nDr Prasad noted instances of elephants wounded by trap guns set up by farmers and surviving for years after the wounds heal, but the corrosion of the iron balls embedded in their flesh, kills them eventually.\n\nHe explained that some farmers kill elephants by using toxic pesticide in vegetables. Electric fences can also kill elephants in minutes or within days.\n\n\"At least three elephants are found dead every week. If an animal that has been poisoned, eaten hakka patas, or has suffered burn injuries from an electrical source, is found alive, there is little chance to save it,'' he explained.\n\nThere are 15 wildlife veterinary surgeons, but their main task is to handle any epidemic situation in wildlife parks and not individual cases.\n\nMeanwhile, wildlife rangers, guards and officials from various parks spelt out the difficulties that they face in elephant conservation. There is not enough staff for monitoring, for raids, to investigate those who set explosives, or those who leave poisoned food in the paddy fields bordering forests.\n\nThere is also not water in Galagmuwa, Giribawa, Hambantota, and Meegalawa because of the drought. Water is brought in by tanker trucks only into some areas.\n\n\"The elephants which roam in search of water take down electric fencing and enter villages.The villagers shot them,''one of them said.\n\nThe lack of staff means they have to call up the unarmed Civil Defence Force to help. They are not trained to handle wildlife issues.\n\nThe rangers also claimed that some elephants are wounded by their own officers because they use live ammunition, not rubber bullets.\n\nDirector general of the DWC, M G C Sooriyabandara, said that over 65% of elephant deaths are caused by shooting.\n\nElephants who fall victim to hakka pattas could suffer for over three months and starve to death.\n\nMr Sooriyabandara said that use of hakka pattas within or outside of wildlife reserves is illegal, but detection is difficult.\n\n\"According to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance any person who kills or harms any protected animal is liable to a jail term and or a fine of Rs 200,000 to Rs 500,000.\n\nMr Sooriyabandara admitted that the DWC is short staffed, but said offenders can be arrested.\n\nHe denied that live ammunition is used and explained that rubber bullets are provided to officers for emergencies.\n\n\"We never encourage officers to shoot animals. We never provide live ammunition, but if individuals are using them we will investigate.''\n\nMinister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, said he wants to find the companies making firecrackers that provide people with gunpowder to produce hakka pattas.\n\nIf animals continued to suffer, new laws will have to be drafted to restrict gunpowder issued to villagers, he said.\n\nMr Perera said that the department needs at least 1,000 officials. He had informed the cabinet that 200 people are urgently needed.", "timeCrawl": "18:53:00", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8835692", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "id": 892, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

released by Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan here, elephants -- India's heritage animal -- are present in over 22 states and a union territory (Andaman and Nicobar Islands).\n\n\"Elephants should not be confined to only few regions of few states...they must spread... We will work to fix the forest corridors and mend their habitats,\" Harsh Vardhan said.\n\nOf all the states, Karnataka has the maximum 6,049 free-ranging or wild elephant population.

(Source: Reuters) Two forest staff injured in elephant attack in CoimbatoreKerala: Elephant attacks man who tried to take a selfie with itElephants and leopards in the city: Run out of luck - and choices\n\nThere were 3,000 extra elephants in India in 2012, but only on paper. An error that combined direct and indirect count methods for the state of Kerala showed an inflated figure of 30,000 elephants across the country. Five years later, the count is 27,312 elephants based on Forest Department officials who \"saw it\" across four geographical regions in India. This prompted elephant expert Raman Sukumar to say on Saturday: \"If I do a comparison with 2012 figures, then we have a stable population.\"\n\nSukumar, a professor at the Centre for Ecological Sciences at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, was the technical adviser for the 'Synchronised Elephant Population Estimation 2017' -- the preliminary findings for it were released Saturday. According to this census prepared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change by direct block count method during March-May 2017, there are 10,139 elephants in India's northeast region, 3,128 in east-central region, 2,085 in northwest and 11,960 in the southern region. At 6,049, Karnataka has the maximum.\n\nThis, ministry officials said, were only preliminary findings in ongoing work, on the \"basis of data made available by the state forest departments\". Even within this there are gaps -- - \"reliable information on elephant distribution area is lacking in some states or forest divisions within a state\", the report said.\n\n\"In particular, no trend information should be made for individual forest divisions or states from these results. In 2017 there were major shifts in dry season habitat used by elephants in the south because of a severe drought in the previous year.\"\n\nWhat remains to be analysed is data from the indirect dung count method -- an estimate that has been in use since 2002 in southern India now adopted across the country. \"This was the first time we used the dung density count across the country,\" Sukumar told The Indian Express. \"Through the dung density estimate we have tried to bring a little more science into the census taking process.\"\n\nSukumar pointed out that elephants leave behind signs. \"The obvious one being dung. They defecate 14-18 times a day,\" he said. \"We use what is a well-known statistical method -- the line transact method -- to make an estimate of dung density. This is a similar method used to get estimates for tiger populations too,\" he said.\n\nThe Wildlife Trust of India has identified 101 elephant corridors in the country of which six have been secured. Union Minister for Environment Harsh Vardhan, who released the census, asked that a strategy be prepared for a \"more even distribution of elephant population in all states of the country.\"\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: elephant", "timeCrawl": "00:56:00", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "2017-05-", "date": "2017-03-", "textStart": 1320, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1334}, {"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 49, "amb": false, "textEnd": 64}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8859276", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"19:47:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "African elephants are the largest terrestrial animal left on the planet.\n\nAs we celebrate World Elephant Day on Saturday, a life-sized ice sculpture of an African elephant is being placed in downtown Manhattan.\n\nThere it will gradually melt, symbolising the alarming rate at which African elephants are disappearing at the hands of poachers.\n\nThe event is part of the campaign #DontLetThemDisappear, launched by Amarula in partnership with WildlifeDirect, a Kenyan NGO.\n\nTo reinforce the message, bottles of the liqueur will be released for sale without the iconic elephant on the label.\n\nAmarula will donate $1 for every bottle sold until the end of the year to support anti-poaching efforts.\n\nInitiatives like this are vital to raise global awareness of the plight of Africa's elephants. Across the continent, one elephant is killed by poachers every 15 minutes.\n\nIVORY\n\nThe global demand for ivory is still the principal driving force pushing elephants to the brink of extinction. As expressed by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, only a sustained global effort can save them.\n\n\"Elephants have lived in coexistence with human beings in Africa for millions of years,\" said the First Lady. \"They are part of our natural environment, our culture, our identity and our heritage. ... We call on all citizens of the world to celebrate World Elephant Day by renewing their commitment to end trade in ivory. The only place that it belongs is on the elephant. Let's play our part in keeping them alive.\"\n\nSaturday's event at Union Square highlights the critical role that consuming countries have to play, both by reducing their own ivory consumption and by building pressure for a global ban on ivory trade.\n\nIn Africa, poachers can only be defeated by adopting a continent-wide approach.\n\nOtherwise, when controls are tightened up in one country, poachers will simply continue their gruesome work in neighbouring countries.\n\nPOACHING\n\nAnti-poaching efforts will also have to be sustained on a timescale much longer than the election cycles in democratic countries.\n\nElections are a reminder to defenders of wildlife of just how fragile our 'victories' can turn out to be.\n\nIn just a few weeks, Donald Trump has been able to dismantle environmental protection measures that took decades to put in place.\n\nHere in Africa, all too often elections take place in a climate of uncertainty that allows unscrupulous people to plunder the natural environment, without fear of redress.\n\nDuring the current election campaign, armed invaders have wreaked havoc in some parts of Laikipia, undoing years of patient wildlife conservation work. Not a single arrest has been made.\n\nAfrican elephants are the largest terrestrial animal left on the planet. It seems unthinkable that they should disappear. But how can we make sure it doesn't happen?\n\nNATURAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nFirst, care for the natural environment should be understood as a moral duty, as it was by our ancestors for whom rivers, trees and animals were sacred. Desecrating them was a sin.\n\nOur natural heritage should be protected at all costs; its importance transcends politics and differences among political parties.\n\nTherefore, non-political organisations such as businesses and civil society organisations have a key role to play.\n\nSecond, this understanding should inform our vision of national development. People in developed countries are rich in many ways.\n\nBut visitors from developed countries who spend large amounts of money for a few moments in the company of elephants are searching for something that their societies, for all their material wealth, cannot provide.\n\nAfrica has the opportunity to map out a different path.\n\nCREATING WEALTH\n\nWe can devise ways of creating wealth that leave our natural environment intact as a source of wonder and inspiration for future generations.\n\nSupport for this vision came last month from an unlikely quarter. Speaking in Nairobi, Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire, argued passionately that Africa should not try to be like China.\n\nInstead, he urged Kenya to develop its own model of development, using technology to protect our unique wildlife and the environment.\n\n\"Now I understand why so many people come to Africa every year,\" he said: \"It's a business opportunity, so leverage that.\"\n\nThis statement from one of the world's most successful businessmen underlines what a terrible mistake it would be to allow development to destroy our natural heritage.\n\nIt also highlights that Africa's has a unique role to play in solving global conservation challenges.\n\nThe collaboration between two African organisations, Amarula and WildlifeDirect, shows that we, as Africans, are taking responsibility for mobilising global support to meet the challenges of saving elephants and defeating the illegal wildlife trade.", "timeCrawl": "19:47:00", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8690688", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

An elephant census released by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change on Saturday revealed an expansion in elephant areas, even while the jumbo population remained \"stable\" at 27,000.\n\nThe report 'Synchronised elephant population estimation India 2017', released on World Elephant Day, estimates that the exact population of jumbos in the country is 27312, with Karnataka reporting the highest population at 6049, followed by Assam at 5719.\n\nThough there has been a decline in overall elephant population from 29391-30711 in 2012, but it is only due to a difference in the counting method. \"We have a healthy elephant population in India. There is no question of a decline. In fact, there may have been a slight increase,\" said elephant expert and head of Asian Nature Conservation Foundation (ANCF) R Sukumar.\n\nExperts termed the \"expansion\" trend as worrying because it could lead to an increase in human-animal conflicts. Jumbos have been reported for the first time in Manipur, Mizoram, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman & Nicobar islands, indicating disturbance in the wild animals' original areas or climate change impacts like temperature and precipitation modification.\n\n\"This expansion has been happening gradually over 30 years. It is worrying because it will be difficult to manage. The real challenge is that elephants are moving to other forest areas, which could increase the potential for conflicts with humans,\" Sukaumar said, adding that the last mass translocation was reported from Tamil Nadu in 1983, following a major drought.

struggling to survive after a jackal attack- and is now thriving in a wildlife orphanage.\n\nKenya Wildlife Service and David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust responded to reports of the wandering calf on March 18 and dispatched a rescue team to pick up the calf.\n\nThe reasons behind why the elephant, who was three or four months old at the time, was abandoned are still unknown, though it is believed

Wildlife Service and David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust responded to reports of the wandering calf on March 18\n\nAngela Sheldrick, Executive Director of DSWT, said of the rescue: 'The Rescue Team located the calf after a short search and it became clear that he was in desperate need of rescuing, and in fact with the infamous Tsavo lions plentiful in that area, it was a miracle that he was still alive.\n\n'Small predators - we suspect jackals - had attacked his rear end and hind legs and, due to his wounds coupled by poor condition, it was evident that we needed to respond fast.'\n\nAfter being found he was driven to the Voi Reintegration Centre nearby and given milk and rehydration salts by the team, who estimated that he was no more than three to four months old.\n\nThe next day, a team of keepers from DSWT's Nairobi nursery flew to the Voi headquarters in Tsavo East National Park to collect the baby.\n\nSince the rescue, the elephant has been nursed back to health by rescue teams and now lives in a nursery\n\nThe reasons behind why the elephant, who was three or four months old at the time, was abandoned are still unknown, though it is believed his mother may have been a

plane and flown to Nairobi National Park, where the DSWT operates an elephant and rhino orphanage.\n\nSheldrick said: 'The reason behind him being abandoned remains a mystery, but there had been a couple of poaching causalities in the area around this time and it is possible that one of these victims was his mother.\n\n'What often happens in such situations is that the calf remains with the herd, but as it loses strength due to a lack of milk, the herd is forced to abandon it when it can no longer keep up due to its weakened state.\n\n'This is more than likely what transpired in this baby's case, because he was incredibly thin and dehydrated when eventually found. It is hard to imagine how frightened and stressed he must have been, all alone in such a hostile environment!'\n\nPoaching remains a threat to elephants across Africa and conservationists like DSWT are doing everything they can to protect elephants from those who wish to profit off of their tusks and their lives.\n\nThe calf has constant care from keepers night and day and they have even reported hearing him snore occasionally\n\nHe has also melted the hearts of the other orphaned elephants, even the older orphans who have previously ignored the babies\n\nOne elephant named Tagwa has taken him under his wing and constantly tries to get his attention and take him on forest adventures, so he can show him what shoots and roots are the tastiest\n\nWhen he was first found, the elephant was driven to the Voi Reintegration Centre nearby and given milk and rehydration salts by the team\n\nSheldrick said: 'It was a long while before we saw positive changes in his body condition, but the presence of the others, particularly best friend Laggard, helped his recovery.\n\n'The bite marks on his legs were cleaned and treated daily until they slowly healed and today little Sattao is finally filling out.'\n\nThe calf has constant care from keepers night and day and they have even reported hearing him snore occasionally.\n\nHe has also melted the hearts of the other orphaned elephants, even the older orphans who have previously ignored the babies.\n\nOne elephant named Tagwa has taken him under his wing and constantly tries to get his attention and take him on forest adventures, so he can show him what shoots and roots are the tastiest.\n\nSheldrick said: 'He has benefited from the love and comfort of our older females, Mbegu and Godoma, who are lavish in their attention of the young babies - carefully ushering them through each day, always guiding them and reassuring them.\n\n'It is a marvel to watch this beautiful, gentle nurturing nature of elephants.\n\n'Some of our successes in the more challenging cases can be attributed directly to the help and care afforded to newcomers by our resident elephant orphans, healing the traumatic scars of loss that haunt these little orphans by giving them that all important ingredient - the will to live.'", "timeCrawl": "10:45:00", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-03-18", "textStart": 374, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 382}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8593779", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "id": 892, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"pinCnt": 10}}

an expansion in elephant areas, even while the jumbo population remained \"stable\" at 27,000.\n\nThe report 'Synchronised elephant population estimation India 2017', released on World Elephant Day, estimates that the exact population of jumbos in the country is 27312, with Karnataka reporting the highest population at 6049, followed by Assam at 5719.\n\nThough there has been a decline in overall elephant population from 29391-30711 in 2012, but it is only due to a difference in the counting method. \"We have a healthy elephant population in India. There is no question of a decline. In fact, there may have been a slight increase,\" said elephant expert and head of Asian Nature Conservation Foundation (ANCF) R Sukumar.\n\nExperts termed the \"expansion\" trend as worrying because it could lead to an increase in human-animal conflicts. Jumbos have been reported for the first time in Manipur, Mizoram, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman & Nicobar islands, indicating disturbance in the wild animals' original areas or climate change impacts like temperature and precipitation modification.\n\n\"This expansion has been happening gradually over 30 years. It is worrying because it will be difficult to manage. The real challenge is that elephants are moving to other forest areas, which could increase the potential for conflicts with humans,\" Sukaumar said, adding that the last mass translocation was reported from Tamil Nadu in 1983, following a major drought. Herds of elephant had moved to Andhra Pradesh, where the jumbo population had been absent for over two centuries.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "timeCrawl": "23:05:00", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8852507", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "id": 784, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

sometimes into valuable cropland, where locals might retaliate.\n\nElephants can also compete or conflict with other animals for limited supplies of food and water, and they can do a number on the environment by stripping trees of their bark.\n\nSouth Africa stopped culling elephants in 1995 amid criticism from animal rights organizations and environmental groups.\n\nBut some governments loosened the ban in 2008 to help manage the growing population.\n\nSEE MORE: China's Ivory Trade Is Dying, And That's Good For African Elephants Some conservationists have tried to use contraception

isn't too many elephants, but rather not enough space.\n\nTo solve this, several groups work to spread out populations .\n\nAfrican Parks, for example, just finished moving 520 from one reserve to another.\n\nBut critics say relocation is expensive and time-consuming.\n\nHowever it happens, humans will need a solution for the two species to coexist.\n\nElephants might enjoy a population boom

The gun would now replace the age-old practise of bursting crackers to chase away the wild jumbos.\n\nPrincipal conservator of forest and additional director K K Kaushal unveiled the pepper gun during the World Elephant Day celebrations at the Tamil Nadu Forest Academy here. The gun would be first introduced in the Periyanaickenpalayam forest range.\n\nThe forest department also lauded the efforts of foresters towards conservation of wildlife and jungles and announced insurance policies for anti-poaching watchers of Coimbatore region.\n\nThe Western Ghats Wildlife Conservation Trust handed over the accidental medical insurance to 141 anti-poaching watchers of Coimbatore, Boluvampatti, Madukkarai, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karamadai, Mettupalayam and Sirumugai ranges. \"Elephants are socially intelligent animals. We should take a leaf out of their life to teach family values to youngsters,\" said Kaushal.\n\nThe principal conservator of forest also said Coimbatore was one of the most important elephant habitats in the country. \"Despite being a big city with a large industrial base, Coimbatore is also a biodiversity hotspot. The good thing is that besides the forest department, local residents also show enthusiasm towards conservation of forests,\" Kaushal said.\n\nHonorary wildlife warden Badrasami, meanwhile, urged the people to understand elephants' habits. \"In Sri Lanka, people have elephants as their pets and they purchase acres of land and convert them into forest-like places for elephants to survive,\" he said.\n\nExpressing a similar view, Kaushal said the people should understand the life of elephants and also learn to live in harmony with them. \"In Africa, the number of man-animal conflicts is less. This is despite Africa having a large elephant population. The reason is that the people there know the life pattern of elephants,\" Kaushal said.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8867532", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "id": 171, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "id": 879, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But not deep enough for people to ease off into a comfortable night's sleep. Having thrown normal life adjacent to the Kalladikode and Malampuzha forests out of gear for over a week, the pachyderms are not in a mood to give up the food and water on offer in human settlements all that quickly. When last heard, they had moved back into the fringes of the man-animal conflict zone. Express examines the travails of both man and beast along the disrupted corridors of elephant movement.\n\nThe Western Ghats is bleeding, literally. The man-animal conflicts have resulted in a bloodbath in the Western Ghats, especially in Munnar. So far, the loss of life has been tallied at three each on both sides this year. While elephants killed three humans, men took the lives of three jumbos in 2017. The blood-soaked battle goes on.Elephants foraying into human settlements and people's efforts to get rid of the wild raids have taken a turn for the worse this year in Chinnakkanal, Marayur and Devikulam areas in Idukki district. For the elders of the region, this is something unprecedented. The conflicts have never lasted for such a long period and they have never suffered such a huge loss in recent years.\n\nAccording to the Forest Department, as many as five people lost their lives and several were injured over the past 13 months in Munnar Division. Crops worth thousands of rupees were damaged along with houses, shops and vehicles by the beasts. However, given the fact the state has the highest number of wild elephants, the man-jumbo encounters in Kerala are less compared to other states. What is the reason behind the sudden spurt of attacks? Forest officials, local residents and environmentalists believe the main reason is the rampant destruction of the elephant corridors between the Anamalai Forest Area and the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR).\n\nThe Broken chain\n\nIn 2002-03, the then UDF Government had set up a tribal settlement named 301 New Adivasi Colony in the catchment area of Anayirangal Dam in Chinnakkanal grama panchayat. The government offered one acre each to 301 families after prolonged and sensational protests of tribals led by C K Janu. Out of 301 families who settled here, only 26 remain now. The reason? Enraged over breaking their corridor, jumbos took six lives over the years and injured many others in this settlement. According to a doctoral research conducted by M Rameshan working at Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS), Thiruvananthapuram, the five new tribal settlements set up by the government after 2003, are in high conflict prone zones.\n\n\"The traditional elephant corridors were rampantly destroyed in Chinnakkanal with superfluous encroachments and construction of resorts,\" he told Express. \"Elephants coming from Anamalai via Mattuppetty usually take the Old Devikulam-Club Mahindra Resort-Chinnakkanal village office route or the Gundumala-Kolukkumala-Pappathichola-Thideer Nagar path to reach Anayirangal Dam. Both these routes have now been invaded by resorts and human settlements. The unscientific tribal settlements augmented the crisis,\" Rameshan said.\n\nThe rate of forest fragmentation and depletion of shola forest, grasslands and fuel wood plantations was high after 1990s, shrinking crucial elephant habitats and blocking their paths resulting in high conflict condition. The once continuous belt of evergreen forests in the high ranges has given way to cardamom plantations in many places. The geo spatial analysis of conflicts shows 85 per cent of the settlements at Anayirangal fall under high conflict prone zones except Pachapulkudi. All the newly-assigned tribal colonies are in the same zone. The percentage area of very high conflict prone zone is high in 301 New Adivasi Colony and Chinnakkanal New Adivasi Colony along the catchment area of Anayirangal reservoir.\n\nNever-ending Woes of Anayirangal Residents\n\nSpread across 114.09 sq.km (11,409 hectares), Anayirangal Valley lies at the juncture of Kannan Devan Hills and Cardamom Hills in Munnar. Anayirangal, which means 'elephants coming down' is known to be a resting place of pachyderms during summer. But uncontrolled construction, rampant encroachments and human interventions disrupted their natural habitat.\n\nThere are 19 settlements in the immediate catchment area of Anayirangal reservoir, including five old tribal settlements, five new Adivasi colonies, nine non-tribal settlements and small towns spread across 6.42 sq.km. The result? Many areas, including Singukandam, Chinnakkanal, Thideer Nagar, B L Ram and tribal colonies have become high conflict zones. \"When encroachments commenced and people started protecting their estates and cardamom plantations with electric fencing, elephant paths were cut forcing them to move on to human settlements,\" said Michael Raj, a resident of Chinnakkanal. \"With the organised encroachers driving the elephants away from their areas with firecrackers, loud noise and camp fires, it triggered behavioural changes in elephants and they started attacking people.\"\n\nThe Remedies\n\nAs per the official records of the Forest Department, six people lost their lives and 17 persons were injured since April 2015 in Munnar Forest Division. The department paid a compensation of Rs 3.88 lakh for the crop loss in 2016-17 fiscal alone. This apart, 40 houses have been damaged in three years. The only solution is to offer a hassle-free path for pachyderms between Chinnar and PTR. According to Chief Wildlife Warden K J Varughese, corridor breakage in Anayirangal can be addressed by clearing the path at Meesappulimala. \"The department is pressing for an elephant sanctuary in Chinnakkanal-Anayirangal Valley.\"\n\n\"A Rs-100 crore project is currently underway to construct protection walls along the forest boundaries. Of this, Rs 25 crore has already been sanctioned and work is underway. The department has been exploring various options like solar fencing, trenches, elephant wall and rail fencing. Depending on the geography of each region, sufficient measures are being taken. At the same time, we should not forget the reasons why they are forced to come into human habitats. Many a time, elephant corridors are being blocked by man-made barriers, forcing these animals to deviate from their natural path. In Idukki and Wayanad, the forest boundaries have not been earmarked properly. The department is also going for measures to ensure elephants get sufficient water and food within the forest. Preserving water resources within the forest and growing more natural forests will help in this direction.\"\n\nForest Minister K Raju", "timeCrawl": "04:38:00", "sim": 0.43529412150383, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-04-", "textStart": 5243, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5253}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8872255", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "id": 320, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "id": 500, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Ecology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Ecology", "id": 507, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "id": 765, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "id": 879, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nMatty Barton, portrayed by Ash Palmisciano, has been grappling with fear while on remand in prison, and in the latest twist of Emmerdale's plot, he was hospitalised after an attack.\n\nSince his incarceration for the accidental stabbing of Samson Dingle (played by Sam Hall), Matty has been living in dread of other inmates discovering that he is transgender, which could potentially make him a target.\n\nIn a fortunate turn of events, after confiding in his cellmate Les about his past identity, Matty gained an ally in Les who offered him some protection against the more aggressive prisoners.\n\nLes, played by Stacey J Gough, vowed to keep Matty's secret. However, during a visitation, Amy Wyatt (Natalie Ann Jamieson) inadvertently revealed to Robbo (John O'Neill) that Matty is transgender, setting the stage for subsequent trouble.\n\nThe episode saw Les gearing up for his release from prison, expressing regret at having to leave Matty vulnerable. With Les no longer there to protect him, Robbo seized the opportunity to intimidate Matty, hurling violent threats his way, reports the Express.\n\nA confrontation ensued when Matty encountered Robbo in the prison corridor, where Robbo mockingly questioned Matty's pronouns, \"Alright, pronouns? How are they/them going? \" To which Matty responded, \"It's just he,\" only for Robbo to cruelly retort, \"No one left to protect you after today, freak.\"\n\nSubsequently, Matty expressed his concerns to a prison officer regarding the threats he had faced. The officer's solution was to place Matty in segregation, which would mean spending most of his time isolated in his cell, a proposition Matty refused.\n\nAmy received a distressing phone call from the prison informing her that Matty had been rushed to hospital, prompting her to rush to his side in Moira's car.\n\nUpon arrival, Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb) was heartbroken to see her son sporting a bruised eye and stitches, while Amy looked on in horror.\n\nMatty tried to reassure them that he was \"okay\", despite having a fractured eye socket and cracked ribs. He revealed that Amy had inadvertently informed a fellow inmate about his trans identity, suggesting that he had been attacked by Robbo.\n\nHowever, before the episode concluded, Matty was visited by Les, a recently released cellmate, who questioned whether he planned to report the violent attack.\n\n\"Oh yeah, can you imagine me grassing on Robbo when he's not even touched me yet,\" was Matty's response.\n\nHe then confessed to Les: \"I'm sorry I asked you to do this to me\", indicating that the assault had been staged to facilitate his removal from the prison wing.\n\n\"Looks like it's all been for nothing\", Matty added emotionally, appearing terrified. Will Matty's injuries deter Robbo from further harassment?\n\nEmmerdale airs weekdays at 7.30pm on ITV.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angie_quinn@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Angie Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moira_Barton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moira Barton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_J._Robb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natalie J.

However, Matty was left terrified when Les revealed he was being released from prison in Tuesday's episode (July 9.)\n\nMatty was seen scrambling for a way to keep himself safe in Les' absence. Moira and Amy then received a call from the prison, informing them Matty had been hospitalised. The pair arrived to find Matty battered and bruised, but he refused to admit who had attacked him.\n\nIt was later revealed Les had beaten Matty up to help him get out of prison and avoid Robbo. Their plan didn't quite work out however, as Matty was told he'd be heading back to prison the next day.\n\nHow will Matty cope without Les' support in prison?\n\nMatty's cellmate Les has proven to be a big hit with Emmerdale fans, who are now hoping he will become a regular character.\n\nMany soap fans took to social media to praise Les, with one person writing: \"Any chance we can keep Les as a character I quite like him.\"\n\n\"Aww I like Les, we need him and Swirling to move into the village,\" a second fan wrote, while a third added: \"They should make Les a regular character once Matty comes out of prison.

Amy is full of guilt about being the cause of Matty being beaten up in prison - but he's about to make an admission that will shock her.\n\nMatty is wrongfully in prison after Samson Dingle (Sam Hall) told the police that Matty stabbed him in an unprovoked attack. Viewers know that the 'stabbing' was an accident and was caused by Samson's horrible friend Josh (Osian Morgan) pushing him at Matty, who was holding a kitchen knife.\n\nAs soon as Matty was sent to prison, after breaking bail by trying to convince Samson to tell the truth, he was terrified for his safety. As a trans man, Matty knew that he would be vulnerable and could be the target of hatred and violence.\n\nHis fears were slightly alleviated when he discovered that his cell-mate Les (Stacey J. Gough) was a good man who could be trusted with Matty's secret, and he told Amy when she visited that Les had his back.\n\nUnfortunately for Amy, when another prisoner approached her she thought it was Les and during the short conversation mentioned Matty being trans. It was only when Matty was severely beaten up that she realised what had happened - she'd actually been talking to Robbo (John O'Neill), 'The prison's biggest transphobe,' according to Matty.\n\nIn this clip Amy is mortified that she was the cause of Matty's injuries and she's full of regrets that she was so careless about talking about Matty's private information. 'I'll never forgive myself,' she tells him.\n\nMatty is upset by her words, because he knows that his beating wasn't her fault at all. In fact it wasn't even Robbo who attacked him - it was his friend Les.\n\nMatty got Les to beat him up so he would be taken to the hospital and would be safely away from the other prisoners now that Les was being released and would no longer be around to defend him.\n\nAs Matty struggles to find the words to tell his wife what really happened, how will she react when he tells her that his injuries - a fractured eye socket and broken ribs - weren't her fault at all but were inflicted by Les in a moment of sheer desperation by Matty?\n\nMORE : Emmerdale confirms major prison twist as liar is finally exposed in 34 pictures\n\nMORE : Emmerdale's Matty rushed to hospital after brutal attack but there's an unexpected twist", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sue_haasler@metro.co.uk", "name": "Sue Haasler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Hall_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Hall (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natalie (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osian,_Jodhpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Osian, Jodhpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osian, Jodhpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wes Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraxinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Barton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Barton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmerdale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmerdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fault (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEI_207616552-286c.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=2px%2C0px%2C1196px%2C628px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716011", "eventUri": "eng-9716011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

A little later in the episode, Amy and Moira got a call from the prison telling them Matty had been hospitalised.\n\nAmy and Moira rushed to the hospital where they found a bloodied and battered Matty with a fractured eye socket and bruised ribs.\n\nAmy was horrified as Matty explained her mix-up with Les and Robbo, with Moira turning against her daughter-in-law for accidentally putting Matty at risk.\n\nMoira and Amy were concerned about why Matty refused to disclose who'd attacked him.

Robb) received a phone call in Tuesday (July 9)'s episode of Emmerdale - and it was the news they'd been dreading since Matty (Ash Palmisciano) was sent to prison. He'd been beaten up by another in-mate and was in hospital.\n\nThey rushed to the hospital to find Matty with appalling injuries, including a fractured eye socket and broken ribs. He revealed that the person who'd done that to him was 'the prison's biggest transphobe,' Robbo (John O'Neill).\n\nAnd Robbo had discovered that Matty is trans after talking to Amy at the end of the visiting session, where she'd assumed she was talking to Matty's nice cell-mate Les (Stacey J. Gough).\n\nMoira was fuming with Amy for her mistake, and Amy was devastated to think that she'd put Matty in danger by being careless about who she spoke to.\n\nThe attack on Matty has made Moira double down on thinking she needs to put pressure on Samson Dingle (Sam Hall) to tell the truth about what happened at the Hide when he was stabbed. The official version of events is that Matty launched an unprovoked attack on him and Samson is sticking to the story because he's scared of possibly going to prison himself if the truth comes out.\n\nHe's also scared of his friend Josh (Osian Morgan), who was the actual cause of the incident.\n\nAfter Josh had been making a nuisance of himself at the Hide and had been making transphobic comments towards Matty, he then demanded money from the till and pushed Samson towards Matty to get it. Samson was impaled on a knife Matty happened to be holding.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the hospital, we saw Matty being visited by his cell-mate Les, who'd been released from prison earlier that day. Earlier we'd seen Les stopping Robbo from attacking Matty, and Matty's sheer terror about what might happen when Les was no longer around to protect him.\n\nMatty told his friend that the plan was to send him back to prison in a day or so. Les said he was sorry.\n\n'No, I'm sorry,' Matty said. 'I'm sorry that I asked you to do this to me. It looks like it's all been for nothing.'\n\nIn a twist, it turned out that Robbo hadn't hurt Matty at all. He'd asked Les to beat him up so he could be taken to the safety of the hospital - but that had backfired badly.\n\nMatty had earlier rejected the offer of a move to the segregation wing, where he would have a cell to himself but would be locked up practically all the time. He'd refused that, but will he now reconsider knowing the extreme danger he's in?\n\nOr will Moira succeed in wringing the truth out of Samson?\n\nMORE : Major Emmerdale and Coronation Street returns confirmed as EastEnders reveals huge secret in 12 new soap spoilers", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sue_haasler@metro.co.uk", "name": "Sue Haasler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moira_Barton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moira Barton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_J._Robb", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natalie J.

After a wonderful soap wedding between Matty and Amy Wyatt earlier this year, their marital bliss was quickly interrupted when he was arrested for stabbing Samson Dingle.\n\nAs viewers of the ITV soap saw last month, Samson's mate Josh took a shine to Amy and continually flirted with her, despite admitting she's a married woman. Josh was introduced to Matty but unbeknownst to anyone else, he later branded Matty a 'freak' after discovering he'd transitioned from a woman.\n\nAs he continued openly flirting with Amy, Samson was clearly uncomfortable at the exchange and tried to get his new pal to give it a rest. However, once Amy had gone, Josh turned to Matty and continued to jibe him before he eventually had had enough. Pouring their paid-for beers away, Matty told them both to leave, which infuriated Josh.\n\nREAD MORE: Gemma Atkinson tells Gorka Marquez to issue her 'reminder' after heartbreak over loss\n\nJoin our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link\n\nWhile outside, Josh made it clear the situation wasn't over, as he told Samson they were owed their drinks. Storming back inside, Matty tried to tell them both he had shut the cafe, although Josh was adamant they weren't leaving without getting their drinks and started making awful remarks about Matty being transgender.\n\nAs Samson joined in the aggravation, Matty warned them to leave before he called the police. Josh started referring to Matty as \"she\" and as he tried to carry on with closing up, picking up a chopping board and a knife, Josh's anger escalated and he pushed Samson into Matty, pushing him straight into the knife leaving him staggering backwards while bleeding profusely.\n\nAfter being arrested, Matty has been remanded in custody and has been living in dread of other inmates discovering that he is transgender, which could potentially make him a target. In a fortunate turn of events, after confiding in his cellmate Les about his past identity, Matty gained an ally who offered him some protection against the more aggressive prisoners.\n\nLes, played by Stacey J Gough, vowed to keep Matty's secret. However, during a visitation, Amy Wyatt (Natalie Ann Jamieson) inadvertently revealed to Robbo (John O'Neill) that Matty is transgender, setting the stage for subsequent trouble. After being tormented by Robbo, Les told Matty he wouldn't be there to protect him as he was getting out.\n\nSubsequently, Matty expressed his concerns to a prison officer regarding the threats he had faced. The officer's solution was to place Matty in segregation, which would mean spending most of his time isolated in his cell, a proposition Matty refused.

Robbo threatened Matty, before being told to back off by Les.\n\nBut as Les prepared to be released, a terrified Matty considered his options. He was told by a prison officer that he could be placed in solitary confinement, but that this would mean him mostly being locked up in a cell alone.\n\nLater in the episode, Amy received a phone call and was told Matty had been rushed to hospital. When she and Matty's mum Moira Dingle arrived at hospital, they were enormously upset to see him battered and bruised.\n\nViewers likely assumed Robbo had done this to him, but as the episode drew to a close Matty confirmed he had asked Les to do it, hoping he'd be in hospital for weeks and away from the wing. But a gutted Matty said doctors had told him he'd be back in prison in a day or two.\n\nReacting to the scenes, many fans on X called on Emmerdale bosses to make Les a permanent character.

It could lead to a devastating exit if viewers' fears become reality, while the latest episode did appear to confirm another exit for a fan favourite on Monday night.\n\nMatty is currently in prison accused of stabbing Samson, after a row with transphobe Josh, Samson's pal. While Matty accidentally impaled Samson on a kitchen knife after Josh shoved him into him, both Josh and Samson have claimed the assault was unprovoked.\n\nAhead of the case going to court, Matty is fearing for his life in jail with just his cellmate Les knowing the truth about him being transgender. Les has been supportive of Matty, but agreed Matty should not tell the other prisoners the truth - including transphobe Robbo.\n\nWith Josh and Samson now plotting to flee before the trial, clearly trying to avoid the truth about the attack coming out, Matty faces a dark future as another twist sealed he would face serious danger. Samson denied the plot to flee before the court visit, but Josh seemed adamant it was going to happen.\n\nWith Samson leaving, it's safe to say at some point Josh will likely leave too. But will they manage to get away before facing Matty in court, and what will this mean for Matty?\n\nAs for exit number three, Les confirmed he would be getting out of prison in a sad update for Matty. This will likely lead to Les leaving the show for good, with him no longer there to protect Matty from harm.\n\nSo with Samson and Josh possibly leaving and Les also leaving prison, could this seal a devastating fourth exit for Matty? With Robbo now knowing Matty's secret, a sinister scene in his cell left fans worried for the character especially now Les isn't going to be around.\n\nVile Robbo began taunting Matty about being transgender, making it clear he needed to watch out and even threatening his life. But will Matty end up facing serious harm as his inmate takes things too far?\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7:30pm on ITV1 and ITVX, with an hour-long episode on Thursdays.* Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_tutton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Charlotte Tutton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmerdale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmerdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITVX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITVX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33195969.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emmerdale-TV-Series-UK-2018.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716011", "eventUri": "eng-9716011", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

He knew that if the men behind bars discovered he is trans, it would sadly make him a target.\n\nRecently though, Matty found himself an ally in the form of a man called Les. He opened up about his past and the journey he's been on, and Les happily listened to try and understand.\n\nLes told Matty that he will keep his secret but reminded him other people in the prison wouldn't be so kind. One of these men will turn out to be Robbo, who only discovers Matty is transgender as a result of a mistake from Amy Wyatt (Natalie Ann Jamieson).\n\nShe mistakes him for Les, and as Robbo manipulates her, she tells him Matty's biggest secret. Amy leaves feeling pleased with herself, no idea what she's just done.\n\nAs a new week begins, Lydia (Karen Blick) and Sam (James Hooton) are poles apart because Sam wants Samson to leave and escape justice, while Lydia is unhappy that Samson wants to evade the law.\n\n'She's done it herself in the past. She thinks it's the wrong thing to do. He needs to tell the truth, Matty needs to be released from prison so that any threat that he's under can be stopped and Samson can face the consequences', Karen Blick told us.\n\n'I don't think Lydia fully understands what that will mean. Will he get a prison sentence? Will it be a relatively short prison sentence? He's a clever lad, he'll be able to come back out and put his life back together. She has very much been the moral compass but we'll see certainly as this story plays out, she has to make a few tough moral decisions herself. She's probably a bit more 'Dingle Code' down the line than she's comfortable with!'\n\nLydia manages to intercept Samson's secret getaway with Sam and implores her son to go to the police station. Eventually, Samson confesses the truth about the stabbing, leaving Sam furious at his wife.\n\n'I think it's his own conscience, I really do. There's multiple stages of pressure and of course that will have an effect and potentially guide his own conscience to tell the truth in the end', actor Sam Hall explained.\n\n'But I do think his morals are very deep down correct, so I think in the end it's himself that thinks, \"Matty's family, this isn't the right thing to do.

But with Samson set to flee the village to go travelling, things aren't looking good for Matty.\n\nThe ITV soap recently aired worrying scenes when his wife Amy accidentally outed Matty as a trans man to his transphobic fellow inmate Robbo.

A brutal attack left him fighting for his life, and Matty lied that he was beaten up by transphobic thugs.\n\nIn another twist, it was later revealed that Matty had actually been beaten up by Les - begging his cellmate to assault him so he could get to hospital and away from the thugs. Matty was left with broken ribs, a fractured eye socket and bruises all over his face - and only got two days' reprieve.\n\nFans, however, think they've exposed a key connection between Les, the perpetrator of the staged attack, and Matty's step-dad Cain - after he seemed to recognise the name when it was brought up in prison.

I was quite worried he was going to be an a******* and would give him a hard time but he seems to always be looking out for him\", one of them jumped in.\n\nAnother TV fan took to the social media platform as they admitted to being sceptical: \"Just can't really see Matty asking Les to hurt him.\" What is really going on with Matty and will he ever find a reprieve in prison?\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs onTikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_carreno@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Laura Carreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_J._Robb", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natalie J.

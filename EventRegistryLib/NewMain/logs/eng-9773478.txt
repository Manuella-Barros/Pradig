He was sacked twice and threw an interception in 7-on-7 drills.\n\nMeanwhile, current Patriots starter Jacoby Brissett only further solidified his standing by going 13 of 16 with two deep completions to wide receiver Tyquan Thornton and one to rookie wideout Javon Baker.\n\nVeteran wide receiver K.J. Osborn has enjoyed working with both QBs.\n\n\"It's been pretty cool,\" Osborn said. \"I've worked with Jacoby in the past. We worked all offseason long in Miami, so we've created a really, really good chemistry that we've seen carry over to here on the field.\n\n\"Drake, we worked in Miami once, as well. We've been working here in OTAs, seeing him come along. He's got a lot on his plate. It's living up to that third (overall) pick, things like that. He's got a lot on his plate. I try to give him space and talk to him when we hit on plays. And if we don't we're practicing after practice and developing that chemistry as we go. Super impressive by him, his smarts and his love for the game, as well.\"\n\nMaye was the last quarterback to take the practice field, walking up the steps from the Gillette Stadium facility to the left practice field at 10:54 before Monday's 11 a.m. practice start time.\n\nMaye warmed up with a staffer before the entire team began their stretching period.\n\nQuarterbacks joined the offensive line, tight end Hunter Henry and running back Rhamondre Stevenson for an offense-on-offense walk-through before breaking off to throw into nets. Brissett, Bailey Zappe and Maye were all 1 of 3 throwing into the net. Rookie Joe Milton III was 2 of 3.\n\nQuarterbacks then went through their usual cycle, throwing to staffers for one period, handing off and throwing to running backs, throwing to tight ends and finally throwing to wide receivers.\n\nMaye completed passes in that period to Javon Baker, Kayshon Boutte, Ja'Lynn Polk, Thornton, Kawaan Baker and David Wallis.\n\nSkill players on both sides of the ball then met for 7-on-7s. Brissett started off the period by going 4 of 6. His best throw came on a deep ball that Thornton caught over his shoulder against cornerback Marco Wilson. He completed an intermediate pass to Henry over the middle but missed on a deep ball to Javon Baker and to Henry when he threw in front of the tight end on a crossing route.\n\nMaye was 2 of 6 in the lone 7-on-7 period, throwing behind tight end La'Michael Pettway before hitting tight end Jacob Warren on a stop route. His third attempt was a shallow out to Mitchell Wilcox that was thrown behind the veteran tight end and tipped and intercepted by safety Kyle Dugger. Maye hit Boutte in the flat but was high to Kawaan Baker on a crossing route and threw to no-mans-land on his final attempt with Wallis closest to the area.\n\nThe Patriots went run-heavy with the pads on in their first 11-on-11s. Brissett was 2 of 2, completing a play-action pass to tight end Austin Hooper in the flat and to Polk on a screen.\n\nMaye handed off three times before taking a sack from outside linebacker Oshane Ximines. Milton handed off to running back Kevin Harris before botching a handoff. Zappe entered to hand off to Hasty before Milton returned to complete a pass in the flat to Hasty and hand off to rookie running back Terrell Jennings.\n\nThe Patriots ran a ball security drill, then the QBs threw to staffers during a special teams period.\n\nIn the final set of 11-on-11s, Brissett was 4 of 4 in his first turn but took two sacks. Among his completions, he hit Henry on an intermediate crosser and stepped up in pressure to complete another intermediate pass to Polk.\n\nMaye was 1 of 4 in his next turn, completing a shallow pass to Javon Baker. He threw wide on a drop by Wilcox. The ball slipped out of his hands on his third attempt, and he threw the ball away under pressure on his fourth dropback.\n\nZappe went 2 of 4 before giving way to Brissett, who was 3 of 4. He threw slightly shallow to Javon Baker, but the rookie wideout leaped over cornerback Alex Austin and safety Jaylinn Hawkins for a highlight-reel catch. After a handoff to Stevenson, starting tackles Caedan Wallace and Chukwuma Okorafor ran laps for a false start. Brissett was incomplete on a crossing route by Polk but then hit Thornton on another deep over-the-shoulder catch in his final competitive throw of practice.\n\nMaye was 0 of 1 in his final period. He threw out in front of Wilcox with linebacker Christian Elliss in tight coverage. After a pitch to Hasty and a handoff to Kevin Harris, Maye took a sack in his final dropback.\n\nMilton finished things up going 3 of 4, but during his period the entire offense took a lap around the goalpost and huddled. Head coach Jerod Mayo told the offense they weren't playing up to the team's standard.\n\nMayo said before practice that the team was hopeful to have its starting offensive line sorted out by the team's third preseason game on Aug. 25. If the quarterback battle is given the same leash, then Maye has plenty of time to catch up to Brissett. But Monday marked the first practice when there was a clear delineation between the two quarterbacks' performances.\n\nMaye does continue to impress his teammates on and off the field.\n\n\"Big arm, athletic, talented, good guy, good work-ethic, he's got the right mindset,\" Hooper said after practice. \"I think we're all just very happy with how committed he is and how hard he's working. We're all rooting for our teammates as we should.\"\n\n\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc. Visit at bostonherald.com.

With all that arm strength, he didn't always need his lower body to generate accuracy and power in college. In the NFL, he'll need to take control of his footwork to meet the league's best-in-the-world level of play.\n\nAnd that's why, even between plays, his feet are restless.\n\nWhen quarterbacks Jacoby Brissett, Joe Milton and Bailey Zappe are running the Patriots offense, Maye is often seen pacing. He walks between coaches and teammates to pick their brains after his repetitions -- and to get a sense of what's working (or not working) during the other quarterbacks' reps. There is no shortage of staff available to Maye, including offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, quarterbacks coach TC McCartney and offensive assistants Evan Rothstein and Ben McAdoo. Maye has also spent time with Brissett, tight end Hunter Henry and receiver Jalen Reagor.\n\nMaye's performance in training camp has closely mirrored his play in college. That was good enough to land him in the third-overall draft slot. But with all top quarterback prospects, there are always plenty of questions.\n\nIf there was one evaluation that has proved prescient, it might be that of former Patriots coach Bill Belichick. He nailed the assessment of what New England must have seen from Maye at North Carolina and what the Patriots are seeing from the rookie in camp.\n\n\"He's going to need some work in reading defenses, reading coverages,\" Belichick said on ESPN's \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on draft night. \"He's kind of quick to bail out of the pocket. He's going to have to hang in there a little bit longer and find those receivers.\"\n\nWhile many thought Belichick's assessment was harsh, it was clear that he was similarly critical of every draft prospect, not as willing to offer effusive praise in the ways most draft analysts do. Belichick's analysis was like a \"South Park\" episode, hating everyone equally. When I texted a former Patriots player about Belichick's candid assessment of Maye and the other prospects, the player replied: \"Haha you experienced a team meeting.\"\n\nWell, here's what the eye in the sky said about Maye.\n\n\"He's quick to come off his receiver,\" Belichick said on ESPN. The broadcast then showed a moment against Clemson where Maye, under pressure, took his eyes off his receivers who were just getting separation. \"That's as open as they're going to get in the NFL, bud. I'm just telling you. They're not going to get open by like eight yards in the NFL. So you've got to deliver it in there. He's kind of quick to bail out of the pocket, and he's going to have to hang in the pocket a little longer and find those receivers.\"\n\nThrough the first few days of camp, it's clear that the foundation of Maye's skills are, roughly, at the spot that Belichick thought they were. And that is, by no stretch, a condemnation of Maye. Coach Jerod Mayo and executive Eliot Wolf knew their new quarterback was a developmental prospect.\n\n\"This is a kid that can make all of the throws,\" Belichick said. \"He just needs to be more consistent. Transitioning from a college quarterback to a pro quarterback, he just needs some time and experience.\"\n\nDuring team drills last week, Maye looked a half-second behind the timing of the rest of the offense, which was just enough for him to miss his moment to deliver the ball downfield to receivers. And as a result, he spent most of these practices checking down on short passes. He completed just one pass of 10 yards or more during Thursday's team drills. On Sunday, it was the same story: Only one pass of ten yards or longer. (He is averaging 15 team-drill passes per practice.)\n\nAs the pocket broke down, Maye showed a propensity to tuck the ball and run a few times, which Mayo indicated was not what he wanted to see. In this non-contact environment, the Patriots want Maye to go through his progression and elude pass-rushers to see how the play progresses downfield. It's all a matter of teaching points.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make it where I'm not missing the read or not necessarily missing the read, but [I'm] not getting through the read as quickly as I need to out here more than one time in a row,\" Maye said Sunday. \"If I make the same mistake [next week], then I'm not making progress, So trying to keep that balance and keep going at it. You're going to keep making mistakes. That's what practice is for.\"\n\nWhile breaking down more of the QB's film against Clemson, Belichick emphasized that Maye needs to stay in the pocket and make his reads. In one instance, he scrambled early, threw the ball late and it was nearly intercepted. \"Of all the quarterbacks, he was the lowest-rated in-the-pocket thrower,\" Belichick said. He brought up film against Florida State that showed Maye could operate in the pocket. Like any high-risk, high-reward prospect, it's a matter of bringing out the good and eliminating the bad.\n\nTo Maye's credit, he has just one interception after 60 passes in team drills during camp.\n\nIt's also worth noting that his top competitor, Brissett, who runs a more efficient offensive unit, has experience in this system and works with a starting-caliber cast. Maye has worked with the second stringers, who are also learning the offense. Maye had two good days getting the offense lined up, but he began to stall in the third and fourth practice, as the playbook install grew more robust. At one point on Sunday, he had to return to the huddle to reset, according to reporters on the scene.\n\nAfter his mistakes, Maye has sought advice from coaches and teammates on the field. He's also doing more than asking questions. In spring and summer practices, Maye has gotten to practice early (sometimes as many as 30 minutes) and stayed late (sometimes as many as 40 minutes). He often spends time with rookie receivers Javon Baker, a fourth-round pick, and Ja'Lynn Polk, a second-rounder.\n\n\"If there's something in practice that we feel like we need to get right or if there's something that Drake feels like he has to get right, wanted an extra rep at, it's our job as receivers to do what our quarterback needs and do what they want,\" Polk said after practice. \"Whatever those quarterbacks need from us, we expect to give it to them.\"\n\nMaye's splash plays have been impressive. He tossed a deep ball down the line for Jalen Reagor that would've been a 50-yard pickup. (It comes with the asterisk of 7-on-7, which lacks the pocket pressure that has plagued Maye. And that's partially an overarching problem for this offense: a talent shortage on the offensive line.)\n\nAnd then there was an 11-on-11 rep on Thursday when Maye worked through his progression on time and found his way to Polk. Maye didn't hesitate. He didn't overthink it. He just fired the ball and picked up a 15-yard chunk.\n\nIt felt like such a notable, crisp rep that Brissett ran to Maye to celebrate.\n\nThe Patriots have been insistent that Maye will get all the time he needs before entering the starting lineup. That's why Mayo has repeatedly said that Brissett is the team's starter. And right now, Brissett is the best quarterback on the field. Maye's progress -- and the rate at which he progresses -- will determine the quarterback battle. Thus far, he is who we thought he was. And that should worry Brissett, because Maye is putting in immense effort to push himself into the QB1 conversation by Week 1.\n\n\"Jacoby is the most pro-ready guy,\" Mayo told the NFL Network on Sunday. \"I don't want to say, obviously, but he's the most pro-ready guy and he shows it on a day-after-day basis. But it is a competition.\"\n\nIt's unlikely that Maye will get anywhere near Brissett in terms of steadiness -- at least this season. That's the appeal of Brissett: his even keel. The question is more about how steady Maye can get in 2024. His upside will eventually make him a more tempting starter, even with the mistakes. But the Patriots will only begin to trust him when he starts to limit his mistakes.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Reagor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Reagor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_McAdoo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben McAdoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Position coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Van Pelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_scramble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback scramble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huddle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1408/814/drake-maye-16x9-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

He was sacked twice and threw an interception in 7-on-7 drills.\n\nMeanwhile, current Patriots starter Jacoby Brissett only further solidified his standing by going 13-of-16 with two deep completions to wide receiver Tyquan Thornton and one to rookie wideout Javon Baker.\n\nVeteran wide receiver K.J. Osborn has enjoyed working with both QBs.\n\n\"It's been pretty cool,\" Osborn said. \"I've worked with Jacoby in the past. We worked all offseason long in Miami, so we've created a really, really good chemistry that we've seen carry over to here on the field.\n\n\"Drake, we worked in Miami once, as well. We've been working here in OTAs, seeing him come along. He's got a lot on his plate. It's living up to that third (overall) pick, things like that. He's got a lot on his plate. I try to give him space and talk to him when we hit on plays. And if we don't we're practicing after practice and developing that chemistry as we go. Super impressive by him, his smarts and his love for the game, as well.\"\n\nMaye was the last quarterback to take the practice field, walking up the steps from the Gillette Stadium facility to the left practice field at 10:54 before Monday's 11 a.m. practice start time.\n\nMaye warmed up with a staffer before the entire team began their stretching period.\n\nQuarterbacks joined the offensive line, tight end Hunter Henry and running back Rhamondre Stevenson for an offense-on-offense walk-through before breaking off to throw into nets. Brissett, Bailey Zappe and Maye were all 1-of-3 throwing into the net. Rookie Joe Milton III was 2-of-3.\n\nQuarterbacks then went through their usual cycle, throwing to staffers for one period, handing off and throwing to running backs, throwing to tight ends and finally throwing to wide receivers.\n\nMaye completed passes on air in that period to Javon Baker, Kayshon Boutte, Ja'Lynn Polk, Thornton, Kawaan Baker and David Wallis.\n\nSkill players on both sides of the ball then met for 7-on-7s. Brissett started off the period by going 4-of-6. His best throw came on a deep ball that Thornton caught over his shoulder against cornerback Marco Wilson. He completed an intermediate pass to Henry over the middle but missed on a deep ball to Javon Baker and to Henry when he threw out of in front of the tight end on a crossing route.\n\nMaye was 2-of-6 in the lone 7-on-7 period, throwing behind tight end La'Michael Pettway before hitting tight end Jacob Warren on a stop route. His third pass was on a shallow out to Mitchell Wilcox that was thrown behind the veteran tight end and tipped and intercepted by safety Kyle Dugger. Maye hit Boutte in the flat but was high to Kawaan Baker on a crossing route and threw to no-mans-land on his final attempt with Wallis closest to the area.\n\nThe Patriots went run-heavy with the pads on in their first 11-on-11s. Brissett was 2-of-2, completing a play-action pass to tight end Austin Hooper in the flat and to Polk on a screen.\n\nMaye handed off three times before taking a sack from outside linebacker Oshane Ximines. Milton handed off to running back Kevin Harris before botching a handoff. Zappe entered to hand off to Hasty before Milton returned to complete a pass in the flat to Hasty and hand off to rookie running back Terrell Jennings.\n\nThe Patriots ran a ball security drill, then the QBs threw to staffers during a special teams period.\n\nIn the final set of 11-on-11s, Brissett was 4-of-4 in his first turn but took two sacks. Among his completions, he hit Henry on an intermediate crosser and stepped up in pressure to complete another intermediate pass to Polk.\n\nMaye was 1-of-4 in his next turn, completing a shallow pass to Javon Baker. He threw wide on a drop by Wilcox. The ball slipped out of his hands on his third attempt, and he threw the ball away under pressure on his fourth dropback.\n\nZappe went 2-of-4 before giving way to Brissett, who was 3-of-4. He threw slightly shallow to Javon Baker, but the rookie wideout leaped over cornerback Alex Austin and safety Jaylinn Hawkins for a highlight-reel catch. After a handoff to Stevenson, starting tackles Caedan Wallace and Chukwuma Okorafor ran laps for a false start. Brissett was incomplete on a crossing route by Polk but then hit Thornton on another deep over-the-shoulder catch in his final competitive throw of practice.\n\nMaye was 0-of-1 in his final period. He threw out in front of Wilcox with linebacker Christian Elliss in tight coverage. After a pitch to Hasty and a handoff to Kevin Harris, Maye took a sack in his final dropback.\n\nMilton finished things up going 3-of-4, but during his period the entire offense took a lap around the goalpost and huddled. Head coach Jerod Mayo told the offense they weren't playing up to the team's standard.\n\nMayo said before practice that the team was hopeful to have it's starting offensive line sorted out by the team's third preseason game on Aug. 25. If the quarterback battle is given the same leash, then Maye has plenty of time to catch up to Brissett. But Monday marked the first practice when there was a clear delineation between the two quarterbacks' performances.\n\nMaye does continue to impress his teammates on and off the field.\n\n\"Big arm, athletic, talented, good guy, good work-ethic, he's got the right mindset,\" Hooper said after practice. \"I think we're all just very happy with how committed he is and how hard he's working. We're all rooting for our teammates as we should.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_kyed@bostonherald.com", "name":

That meant a more intensified focus on the running game. But it also meant a more physical pass-rush. It meant more handsy defensive backs, both at the line of scrimmage and at the catch point.\n\nIt ended up being a difficult day for the No. 3 overall pick in this year's draft. Let's get to the details in our Day 5 edition of the Drake Maye Report.\n\nMaye received six reps in the lone 7-on-7 period of practice to go along with 13 reps in 11-on-11 periods. Those 19 total snaps were about in line with the 18 competitive reps he saw in the previous practice.\n\nAnd, as has been the case over the last several practices, Maye and top quarterback Jacoby Brissett got about the same volume of work. Though it was Brissett who was the first quarterback up in all team periods, he also got six 7-on-7 snaps and 14 plays of 11-on-11 work. Brissett ended up with one more rep, in all likelihood, because there was one botched snap count with Brissett that might've led to a do-over from the coaching staff.\n\nBailey Zappe and Joe Milton continued to split the remaining quarterback reps, but the way in which Maye has been handled has been consistent throughout camp. Offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt is trying to develop Maye with real action on the field, not just having him watch from the sidelines.\n\nMaye finished the 7-on-7 period completing just two of his six attempts, including one interception. He went 1-for-4 in 11-on-11 periods and was \"sacked\" during one rep. In all, he went 3-for-10 in competitive periods.\n\nBrissett, meanwhile, went 4-for-6 in 7-on-7 work. He was nearly perfect in 11-on-11s, going 8-for-9, with his lone incompletion coming thanks to a drop by rookie wideout Ja'Lynn Polk. In all, he went 12-for-15, in what was decisively the best quarterback performance of the day.\n\nFor Maye, there were no standout plays. Of his three completions, the longest connection was likely a completed curl route to fellow rookie Javon Baker in 11-on-11 work. He also hit tight end Jacob Warren and Kayshon Boutte for modest gains in 7-on-7 work.\n\nIn this section of The Drake Maye Report, we'll highlight the portions of the rookie's performance that suggest he's prepared to sit atop the hierarchy of quarterbacks in New England sooner rather than later.\n\nMay have to stretch a bit here since there weren't obviously-positive moments to point to in this run-heavy practice. Therefore, this may be the rare (I think) case in which we reference the same play in both our \"Why He's Ready\" and \"Why Patience Is a Virtue\" sections.\n\nIn an 11-on-11 period about midway through the practice, Maye was faced with what ended up looking like an all-out pressure. He was immediately moved off his spot by interior pressure and threw a pass away out of bounds.\n\nOne thing that has stood out about Maye through five practices is his athleticism to be able to get himself out of trouble -- something he'll need whenever he's named the starter, particularly if there remain questions along the offensive line. There are situations in which an incompletion won't kill a drive, but a sack will. On that particular play, Maye flashed the ability to turn a potentially negative play into a no gain.\n\nIn this section of The Drake Maye Report, we'll highlight the portions of the rookie's performance that suggest he's not quite ready to sit atop the quarterback depth chart.\n\nWhile Maye was able to remove himself from immediate trouble on that particular snap, he might've been able to further wiggle himself out of a tight spot by having an answer before getting flushed from the pocket.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that Maye is not yet at the stage of having the \"answers to the test\" pre-snap, as Tom Brady used to say. But as he develops, and as he gets more accustomed to the types of exotic pressures he'll face from NFL defenses, he'll likely have different tools in his quarterbacking tool belt to be able to handle challenging blitzes.\n\nMaye had brief bouts of inaccuracy on Monday, falling as he threw one incomplete, and making tight end Mitchell Wilcox lay out for a pass that probably should've been completed. But there were multiple plays on Day 5 -- the throwaway when under pressure, and a sack on a roll-out -- where perhaps Maye could've had an answer before having to try to use his athleticism to avoid a negative result.\n\nIt's worth noting: Maye worked with reserve center Atonio Mafi -- inexperienced at the center spot -- on Monday. David Andrews was out, meaning veteran backup center Nick Leverett worked with Jacoby Brissett. In this scheme, centers are typically relied upon to take charge in setting protections pre-snap, meaning Maye had less experienced help than usual.\n\nThat's not to excuse away any of Maye's performance, but it's context that should be highlighted as we assess what we've seen.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayshon_Boutte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayshon Boutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Van Pelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonio_Mafi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atonio Mafi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Wilcox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_bounds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out of bounds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Andrews_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Andrews (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/353fae3b428881bf56fb1575fdf26679", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

And he hasn't been alone.\n\nMaye played behind a second-string offensive line of, from left to right, Calvin Anderson, Michael Jordan, Antonio Mafi, Layden Robinson and Vederian Lowe. Mafi, specifically, worked with the second unit since center David Andrews was absent and Nick Leverett filled in on Jacoby Brissett's first team.\n\nThe Patriots have rotated receivers throughout six practices so it's not as if Maye is drawing any short straws with pass-catchers. But it's still fair to question how Maye's struggles have been hindered by those around him.\n\nThe most notable stretch came during the offense's third 11-on-11 period -- the main team period -- after Maye went 3-4 with six run plays in the prior 10 full-team reps. Fine start, right? Sure. But then the wheels feel off for Maye and his group.\n\nThe rookie quarterback went 1-for-6. He struggled with his accuracy, as evidenced by Maye's high rollout throw intended for a leaping Ja'Lynn Polk. It seemed he struggled to diagnose the pressure, too. The defense had its way with the offense. But those in front of Maye didn't do much to help either.\n\nMafi opened with two low snaps. It surely impacted Maye's first pass to tight end Mitchell Wilcox as the timing on the quick read was thrown off from the jump. Maye targeted rookie Javon Baker on the second rep, another incompletion which followed a low snap. On the third play of the period, running back Kevin Harris fumbled after another snap gave Maye some trouble. Patriots cornerback Marco Wilson picked it up for what would have been a scoop-and-score.\n\nIt didn't improve.\n\nWilson then broke up a Maye pass intended for Baker. JaMycal Hasty was stuffed on a run play where a pile resulted in Kayshon Boutte's helmet popping off while linebacker Joe Giles-Harris and the defense barked at the offense.\n\nIt was so bad the Patriots gave Maye the opportunity to reset with the third-stringers before Joe Milton III came on. Maye hit wide receiver Kawaan Baker on an out-breaking route on the first snap. But the damage was done.\n\nMaye finished the day 8-for-15 including a 5-for-11 stretch during 11-on-11s. He was 9-for-16 during a 1-on-1 portion, per the Boston Herald's Doug Kyed. He was 3-for-11 during competitive periods Monday.\n\nMaye's teammates have lauded the rookie signal-caller for his work ethic and physical tools. While speaking with the media after Tuesday's practice, Patriots wide receiver Jalen Reagor called Maye a \"student of the game.\" Reagor said there's going to come a time when Maye earns more opportunities, and when that time comes he's going to show why he was drafted third overall.\n\nSo while it's clear Maye is not in a neck-and-neck competition with the veteran Brissett. And while it's increasingly clear Maye, who was drafted because of his potential rather than his polish, is going to need time to get things right. That shouldn't come as that much of a surprise.\n\nAnd given it's been six practices with merely two in pads, and given the group around Maye hasn't been up to par either, it shouldn't serve as too much of a concern. It's going to take time.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_t_mcguire@nesn.com", "name": "Sean T.

There is still plenty of time for Maye to push Brissett, match him and potentially pass him in the QB battle, but the offense is currently in better shape with the veteran QB under center.\n\nMaye had a chance to respond Tuesday to a challenging performance in the first padded session of his career, and things started out well. He arrived 10 minutes early to practice, warmed up with staffers and stretched with the rest of the roster. After some offense vs. offense walk-throughs with the quarterbacks, offensive line, Stevenson and tight ends Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper, Maye, Brissett, Bailey Zappe and Joe Milton threw into nets. For the first time, all four quarterbacks went 2-of-2, and Milton capped things off with a standing backflip, playing to the crowd.\n\nQuarterbacks then threw to staffers, handed off to running backs, threw to running backs and threw to tight ends. Against air, Maye skied a pass to tight end La'Michael Pettway during the individual work.\n\nHe also missed a pass throwing to wide receivers on air, hitting Tyquan Thornton, Javon Baker and JuJu Smith-Schuster but overthrew Baker on his eighth attempt.\n\nThe Patriots then broke into 1-on-1s. Maye started out with wide receivers facing off against cornerbacks. He was 2-of-4 in his first turn. He threw an accurate deep ball to wide receiver K.J. Osborn -- perhaps his best throw of the day, but cornerback Jonathan Jones yanked it out for a pass breakup. He completed passes to Ja'Lynn Polk and David Wallis but missed Kawaan Baker.\n\nMaye then crossed from the right practice field to the left practice field to begin throwing to running backs and tight ends facing linebackers and safeties. He was 7-of-12 throwing to running backs and tight ends. Tight end Mitchell Wilcox dropped one of the incompletions, and linebacker Steele Chambers broke up a pass intended for running back Terrell Jennings, but Maye was also inaccurate on passes to tight end Hunter Henry and threw too long to running back JaMycal Hasty on a deep ball against linebacker Christian Elliss.\n\nOverall, Maye was 9-of-16 in the 1-on-1 period.\n\nBrissett was up first in 11-on-11s, going 1-of-3 with three handoffs, hitting Wilcox in the flat. Safety Joshuah Bledsoe broke up a pass on a target to Henry on a drag route, and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster dropped a target while wide open.\n\nMaye was 2-of-2 and handed off four times. He hit Wilcox in the flat on a play-action pass and Pettway in the flat.\n\nLinemen then went to the far side of the field while the quarterbacks and skill players worked on 7-on-7s in the red zone. Brissett was 2-of-4 with one of the top plays of practice, throwing to Polk in the back left corner of the end zone with the rookie high-pointing the ball over cornerback Marco Wilson.\n\nMaye was 3-of-4, hitting Stevenson in the flat, slot receiver DeMario Douglas on a shallow out and Smith-Schuster on a slant. He overthrew Henry with safety Kyle Dugger in coverage.\n\nZappe also went 3-of-4.\n\nThe red zone work continued in 11-on-11s. Brissett hit Henry for a touchdown up the seam with Bledsoe in coverage. Brissett was 1-of-3. He had to throw the ball away with defensive end Keion White bearing down with pressure. His final pass of the period was broken up by Bledsoe on a target to Hooper.\n\nMaye was just 1-of-2, overthrowing Osborn on an intermediate pass and completing a bubble screen to wide receiver Kayshon Boutte. The offense also had to re-huddle on the fourth snap of Maye's turn.\n\nMilton was 2-of-3 and fired up the offense by hitting Smith-Schuster in the end zone on a slant.\n\nFollowing ball security and special teams periods, the Patriots ended practice with more 11-on-11 work. Brissett was 3-of-4 with a sack. At one point, the entire offense had to take a lap around the goal post after Polk committed a pre-snap penalty. Brissett responded on the next play by hitting Osborn on an intermediate slant.\n\nMaye was 2-of-7. He threw behind Wilcox on a stick route that was broken up by Elliss and overthrew Javon Baker on a drag before running back Kevin Harris fumbled. Cornerback Marco Wilson recovered it for a touchdown. Maye then threw behind Javon Baker on a pass breakup by Wilson, handed off to rookie running back DeShaun Fenwick and threw behind Polk on a bootleg pass. Maye hit Polk on a drag route, handed off to Hasty and then had a pass broken up by cornerback Shaun Wade on a fade route by Javon Baker.\n\nThe offense reset, Maye completed a pass in the flat to tight end Jacob Warren, scrambled on his next snap and then handed off to Jennings.\n\nMilton finished things off by going 1-of-2 with a handoff.\n\nMaye has struggled to make standout plays in his first two padded practices, and there have been too many pre-snap issues overall for the Patriots' offense over the past three days.\n\nWide receiver Jalen Reagor is still seeing encouraging signs, however.\n\n\"He's got a lot of arm talent,\" Reagor said. \"Whenever he does get more opportunities, he's going to show you guys how great he really is and why he went where he went.

He's a great resource to talk to, just the way he sees the game, the way he can communicate with his teammates.\"\n\nHooper was also asked about Maye, and gave an answer that tells the whole story of New England's quarterback competition.\n\n\"He has a big arm, athletic, talented, good guy, good worth ethic,\" Hooper said. \"He's got the right mindset. I think we're all just very happy with how committed he is and how hard he's working.\"\n\nMaye is working hard. He has the tools. His teammates can see the work he's putting in. Does any of that have anything to do with what he's actually doing on the field? No.\n\nBrissett continued to distance himself in the so-called \"competition\" Monday, having what might have been his best practice of camp on the first day of full pads. He completed 12-of-17 total passes in competitive team drills, finding Javon Baker, Ja'Lynn Polk and Tyquan Thornton for explosive plays that really riled up the crowd.\n\nBrissett's strike to Polk, in particular, was surprising, as he evaded pressure and dropped a nice touch pass behind the defense into the waiting arms of his rookie receiver. It was about as athletic a move as you'll see 31-year-old pull off.\n\nIt shouldn't be understated how much Brissett benefitted from playing with the top unit, though. Chukwuma Okorafor-Sidy Sow-Nick Leverett-Mike Onwenu-Caedan Wallace repped as the top offensive line, with David Andrews missing practice altogether, and showed exactly why you should hold off on judging the trench battle until pads come on.\n\nIt was their best day of camp, for certain.\n\nMaye wasn't necessarily awful, but he wasn't able to overcome playing with the second unit. He completed just 3-of-11 passes in competitive periods, though three of those incompletions could be considered drops. Bailey Zappe (3-for-4) and Joe Milton III (4-for-5) had better days in terms of completion percentage.\n\nMaye was on the field for three \"sacks\" by the defense, trying to take off with his legs but still not being able to do much with the collapsing offensive line in front of him. Baker, Jacob Warren and Kayshon Boutte were his receivers on the three completions, while Calvin Anderson-Michael Jordan-Atonio Mafi-Layden Robinson-Vederian Lowe made up his offensive line from left to right.\n\nIt wasn't a good day for Maye, but did he have much of a chance?\n\nThe Patriots will continue to get him second-team reps, but as camp moves on it can be expected that he gets more time with the top receivers. It's when the 21-year-old is throwing to guys like Polk, Hunter Henry, Rhamondre Stevenson and DeMario Douglas that we can get a better understanding of where he's at.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keagan_stiefel@nesn.com", "name": "Keagan Stiefel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Hooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin Hooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyquan_Thornton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyquan Thornton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayshon_Boutte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kayshon Boutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamondre_Stevenson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhamondre Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Andrews_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Andrews (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/Drake-Maye-19.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 156, "textEnd": 163}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Rookie Drake Maye has a lot of potential, but it's clear Brissett is the top quarterback on the roster for now.\n\nTo be fair, Maye has been working with the second-team offensive line unit. Nevertheless, Brissett was sharp at Monday's practice in particular, going 8-of-9 in 11-on-11s and 4-of-6 in 7-on-7s.\n\nMeanwhile, Maye went 1-of-5 in 11-on-11s and 2-of-6 with an interception in 7-on-7s. He bounced back well in Tuesday's practice, but it's clear that the rookie still has a lot of work to do. It's expected considering he's only 21 years old and still developing his game at the next level.\n\nWhen breaking down Maye's early struggles, Pro Football Network's Dakota Randall wrote:\n\nMaye shows flashes of his immense talent. But he also rushes throws, is spotty with his accuracy, and makes too many pre-snap penalties. There's no reason for Patriots fans to panic, as Maye is enduring typical rookie struggles. Nevertheless, it's getting harder and harder to envision him as the Week 1 starter.\n\nThis isn't necessarily saying that Maye is having a bad camp or that he will struggle throughout the remainder of it. Rather, it establishes the pecking order of things.\n\nMaye still needs time to develop. This is exactly why the Patriots signed Brissett. They knew they needed a bridge quarterback and were anticipating drafting a rookie. Now, they have to go through the natural progression of rookie growing pains.\n\nPatriots offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt hinted early on that Brissett would be the Week 1 starter. That looks to be the case right now. It will be fascinating to see how the rest of the quarterback competition plays out.\n\nAt the very least, the Patriots have a polished veteran they can fall back on. That's more than they could say a year ago.", "source": {"uri": "patriotswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Patriots Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_jaillet@patriotswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Danny Jaillet", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Van Pelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/07/USATSI_23816202.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Drake Maye simultaneously suffered through his worst practice as a Patriot and produced one completion against two sacks during 11-on-11s. Not great.\n\nThe good news for Maye: there's still three weeks left.\n\nAs Brissett pulled further ahead Monday, the Patriots ran the ball surprisingly well over their first padded practice this summer. Running backs Rhamondre Stevenson, Antonio Gibson and Kevin Harris all ripped off long gains during team drills, despite rushing behind a backup center and a rookie at left tackle. It helped that the Pats' top defense had holes to begin with.\n\nFor the first time in training camp, outside linebacker Matt Judon missed an entire practice during his contract dispute. He watched initial stretching in street clothes, then left after an early chat with Jerod Mayo and returned for an animated, mid-practice talk with director of player personnel Matt Groh before leaving again. Meanwhile, disgruntled defensive tackle Davon Godchaux sat out most team periods, as his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, put pressure on the Patriots through his attendance and a long chat with Groh.\n\nWhen Godchaux was absent, that left the Pats without their two best defensive tackles (Christian Barmore is out indefinitely), and often a top safety. Jabrill Peppers missed 11-on-11s due to a new lower-body injury that required two visits to the trainer's table. Oh, and outside linebacker Joshua Uche got kicked out of practice after a post-play scrum late in the team drills.\n\nElsewhere, the entire offense took a penalty lap, two receivers made highlight reel catches, rookie O-linemen starred in 1-on-1 pass rush and Kyle Dugger snatched an interception.\n\nHere are the Herald's complete practice observations:\n\nAbsent: C David Andrews, S/LB Marte Mapu\n\nNon-participant: OLB Matthew Judon, TE Jaheim Bell\n\nPUP: WR Kendrick Bourne, LB Sione Takitaki, OL Cole Strange, C/G Jake Andrews\n\nNotes: Judon wore street clothes during stretching, left the practice fields, then returned and left again. Godchaux participated in positional work and the final 11-on-11 period, but didn't wear leg pads. Peppers dealt with an apparent lower-body injury that kept him out of team drills.\n\nStarting center David Andrews missed his first practice of training camp for unknown reasons. Douglas is still limited by a minor hand injury, Mapu sat out his third straight practice, and Bell missed his first.\n\nLate in 11-on-11s, the Patriots' fourth-round rookie receiver leapt over two closing defenders -- cornerback Alex Austin and safety Jaylinn Hawkins -- for a spectacular grab 30 yards downfield. Baker had taken off on a go route down the right sideline, but stopped just in time to leap and pluck Jacoby Brissett's pass out of the air on a line. The Patriots' social media team waited just a matter of minutes before posting it\n\nQB Jacoby Brissett\n\nThe best performance by any quarterback so far in camp.\n\nBrissett found Baker deep, then dropped one in the bucket for Tyquan Thornton, who also beat Alex Austin's tight coverage for a big gain during 11-on-11s. Brissett threw in rhythm and showed calm in muddy pockets. But enough about that.\n\nGoing 10-of-11 in pads just about says it all.\n\nNote: The passing stats below were tallied during competitive 7-on-7 and 11-on-11 periods only. The stats in parentheses represent the quarterbacks' camp-long performance.\n\nNotes: Brissett hit passes at all three levels during an opening 7-on-7 period, finding four different receivers while Maye found two teammates and Kyle Dugger on an interception. After Maye went 2-of-6 in that drill, he made three straight hand-offs and took a sack during the team's initial, run-focused 11-on-11 period. Over the final full-team sessions, Maye went 1-of-4, including a contested slant throw and one drop, then misfired over the middle and took a sack.\n\nThe rookie missed behind and ahead of receivers and struggled in crowded pockets. Maye is struggling to throw with a proper base in those situations, which has affected his accuracy. As for Brissett, his 6-of-7 showing during full-team periods included two deep strikes and completions to all the Pats' starting tight ends and receivers.\n\nOL Mike Onwenu\n\nThe Patriots' best offensive linemen went 3-0 during 1-on-1 pass rush, stoning Josh Uche twice and the powerful Keion White on another rep. Onwenu also paved the way on two long runs that gashed the Patriots' starting defense off the right side. Whether he's at tackle or guard, Onwenu is making an impact.\n\nWR Tyquan Thornton\n\nIs this former second-round pick finally coming around?\n\nThornton had a rare strong practice in pads, showing off his improved strength and focus making not one, but two over-the-shoulder grabs during team drills. Both came from Brissett, who has worked regularly with the 6-foot-3 speedster on the first-team offense. Thornton finished with X catches overall.\n\nIn the opening 7-on-7 period, Maye went 2-of-6 with an interception. He followed that performance with one completion over two 11-on-11 drills: a slant to Javon Baker that was nearly broken up. Maye had multiple bad misses and took a couple sacks. Chalk it up to growing pains.\n\nPatriots rookie QB Drake Maye experiences growing pains in first padded practice\n\nThanks to his elite speed rush and burst off the line, Uche typically dominates 1-on-1 pass rush. Not Monday.\n\nHe went 0-3, losing twice to Onwenu and projected starting tackle Chukwuma Okorafor. If that wasn't bad enough, Uche and Okorafor got tangled after one play later in team periods, and Uche got kicked out.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston

Still just 21, he was the second-youngest quarterback drafted and a prospect who would need fine-tuning. But the potential, they thought, was so, so high.\n\nSo perhaps it's not a surprise that Maye has had some tough moments in training camp. On Sunday, he was (at best) just OK. Monday, he completed only three passes in full-team drills, a rough performance for the rookie. A week into training camp, it's clear that Jacoby Brissett's grasp on the starting QB job is firm.\n\nWith all that in mind, I wanted to run back an annual training camp story by focusing my binoculars on one player for a full practice. So on Tuesday, I followed every step Maye took from the time he walked onto the practice fields outside Gillette Stadium to when he left them two hours and 57 minutes later. Here's what we saw.\n\n10:48 a.m. ET: Maye jogs onto the field, but not to where the rest of the quarterbacks are. He greets quarterbacks coach T.C. McCartney on the far end and does some resistance-band work to prepare for practice on this hot and sunny day.\n\nAfter that, he takes some snaps from guard-turned-center Atonio Mafi and throws some passes to a nearby trainer.\n\n11:00 a.m.: Maye joins the other quarterbacks for team stretching. Unlike the rest of the quarterbacks, he wears a sleeveless undershirt that doesn't show from under his red No. 10 jersey and has a towel attached to the front of his pants. Brissett and Joe Milton opt for long sleeves.\n\n11:08 a.m.: It's a slow start to Day 6 of practice for the Patriots. The offense gets together and walks through various plays at half-speed. It's simple prep for someone like Brissett who has been in this offense before. But they're still important reps for Maye as he gets accustomed to being under center more and going through the proper dropbacks.\n\nAfter his turn under center, Maye chats with McCartney, then offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, then offensive assistant Ben McAdoo. It's a notable departure from the previous regime. Bill Belichick liked for the offensive coordinator to also be the quarterbacks coach, so he was the sole voice for the position. Jerod Mayo is opting for an open approach with multiple voices, one that has grown in popularity around the league.\n\n11:20 a.m.: The quarterbacks drop back from under center and throw passes into a net. The group charts who does the best in their meeting room, a way to turn an otherwise mundane drill into a fun competition. Brissett waves to hype up the crowd, getting them to cheer after each successful throw.\n\nWhen the quarterbacks go a combined 8-for-8, Milton celebrates by doing a backflip.\n\n11:28 a.m.: At first, the quarterbacks work only with the running backs, trying to perfect their handoffs. Then it's going through plays with just the tight ends. Then just with the wide receivers.\n\nThis is where practice begins to feel a bit slow. But it's an important time for quarterbacks to build chemistry. That takes time.\n\n11:38 a.m.: One theme with Maye and the quarterbacks through these early practices is their focus on footwork. Now that handoffs and passes are done, they work on rollouts, faking a handoff then drifting away and throwing on the run.\n\nThis is where Maye really shines. He's an impressive athlete who has made some of his best throws during camp while on the move.\n\n11:43 a.m.: The most exciting part of practice is here: one-on-one pass-catching drills. Wide receivers against cornerbacks. Tight ends and running backs against linebackers and safeties. In theory, the offense should thrive. The field is wide open, and it's a one-on-one matchup -- the kind the offense would love to get in a game.\n\nEven though it's just one-on-one drills, though, Van Pelt makes the quarterbacks simulate an under-center snap and act as if there's play action. That makes them more important reps for Maye, who was mostly in the shotgun in college and didn't run much play action.\n\nMaye completes 9-of-16 passes.\n\n11:59 a.m.: After five minutes of standing next to McCartney and watching the top offense, Maye gets his first 11-on-11 reps. He hits a short pass on the first play, but the session focuses mostly on the running game. After each handoff, Maye continues to roll out in a bootleg as if he'd kept the ball. This is part of the marriage of the run and pass that offensive coaches often talk about. The actual runs should look just like play actions.\n\nMaye's only two completions in this drill are checkdowns.\n\n12:07 p.m.: After a brief break, the team heads to seven-on-seven drills in the red zone. They work out of the shotgun, and it's clear Maye is more comfortable there. He hits Demario Douglas near the sideline and JuJu Smith-Schuster across the middle for a touchdown.\n\nMaye then rotates with Brissett, who hits Hunter Henry in the back of the end zone. When Maye returns to the lineup, the series focuses more on the run game. Whether by design or coincidence, Maye gets a lot of work on the proper footwork of dropping back and handing the ball off.\n\nMaye throws two passes including a touchdown to Kayshon Boutte in the flat. As Maye turns after the score, Brissett leaps on top of him, celebrating the rookie's pass.\n\nThis is part of why the Pats signed Brissett. They think he's good enough to be their quarterback at the start of the season but also a mentor and motivator for Maye.\n\n12:29 p.m.: Most of the team switches to special teams work. The four quarterbacks go to a separate field. Van Pelt lines up behind an imaginary center, clearly demonstrating the footwork he's looking for. His offense is built on timing and syncing up the run and pass. The quarterback's footwork is so important to both. McCartney and assistant quarterbacks coach Evan Rothstein are next to Van Pelt, helping oversee the drill as the quarterbacks try to emulate the proper footwork.\n\n12:39 p.m.: It hasn't been the most intense practice, but the last 20 minutes are earmarked for 11-on-11 reps, a chance for Maye and the others to impress.\n\nBut the whole offense starts shakily. A miscue from the first-team group leaves Brissett yelling and Mayo so unhappy that he makes the whole offense -- Maye and the backups included -- run a lap.\n\nWhen Maye takes over with the second team, there are issues from the start. David Andrews is absent, so Nick Leverett is the first-team center, leaving Mafi as the center for Maye. His shotgun snaps are consistently off the mark, forcing Maye to take his eyes off the field. Beyond that, the backup offensive line is getting beaten with ease, and the second-team wide receivers aren't exactly separating.\n\nAt one point, Maye's five-play stretch consists of two incomplete passes, a sack, a fumble on what looks to be a botched handoff and a run that's stuffed.\n\nAll of it is bad. But it's still worth remembering what Maye is working with: a backup guard-turned-center, bad receivers and a struggling offensive line.\n\n12:52 p.m.: By now, Brissett has had his turn with the first-team offense, and Maye has had his with the second team. It should be on to either Milton or Bailey Zappe. But after all the struggles, the coaches keep Maye out there for another go.\n\nHe completes a sidearmed, falling-away pass to Jacob Warren on the first play, then is forced to scramble on the next.\n\nWithout tackling, it's hard to gauge how effective his frequent scrambles are. If he becomes a Josh Allen type of runner, Maye's athleticism can be a big-time weapon and mitigate some of the concerns on the offensive line. If not, you could argue he's leaving the pocket too early. But since tackling the quarterback isn't allowed, it's hard to know yet which is the case.\n\n1:00 p.m.: Full-team sprints across the field signal the end of practice. It isn't the kind of bounce-back, head-turning session Maye hoped for after a rough Monday. He completed 5 of 11 passes in full-team drills Tuesday with some mishaps and sacks along the way.\n\nBut as he huddles with Van Pelt after the session, it's worth considering the grander scheme. Maye is 21. This is his sixth training camp practice. Unlike Brissett, he's in a new offense. Sure, he hasn't picked things up so quickly that he's challenging for the starting job. But the ceiling that so enticed the Patriots back in April hasn't changed.\n\n1:13 p.m.: After practice, Maye takes off his pads but holds onto a football. He spins it on his finger like a basketball and looks for a receiver to throw to.\n\nBelichick said last year there are never enough reps for quarterbacks. Their arms don't tire like a baseball pitcher's, and their work isn't as physically exhausting as offensive linemen or other positions.\n\nEventually, Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker emerge, a trio of rookies to whom so much of the Patriots' hope is attached, and they run some routes together.\n\n1:22 p.m.: The receivers head out. Their work for the day is done. Before Maye goes to take pictures and sign autographs for fans, a trainer takes his pads and helmet to the locker room. Most first-year players are tasked with bringing veterans' gear back with them. But, hey, there are perks to being a first-round quarterback.\n\n1:45 p.m.: Maye goes through the entire line of waiting (and often hollering) fans so each can get a photo or autograph. The whole process takes more than 20 minutes.\n\nAt one point, he is handed a Tom Brady jersey. In the moment, it's a small thing. A kid brought an old jersey, perhaps his only one, for a signature at training camp. But it's also a reminder of who was once here and the pressure that follows for any New England quarterback.\n\nBy the time Maye is done, the fields are empty. Everyone has gone back, eager for the off day that awaits on Wednesday. Finally alone, Maye heads down the stairs toward the locker room to get ready for another day in the NFL.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

That's the big question in Foxboro, as New England brought in veteran signal caller Jacoby Brissett in free agency. A scenario exists where Brissett gets the keys to the offense to start the season before Maye eventually takes over, and that's what Dan Graziano of ESPN is banking on.\n\nGraziano wrote in his Monday column he believes Brissett will start the season under center as Maye continues to get up to speed.\n\n\"Here's another story with an ending you already know,\" Graziano wrote. \"Maye was the third overall pick in this year's draft and will be the starter eventually. But he's still 21 years old and was viewed by many in the pre-draft process as a raw prospect who'd need time to develop. He has made some breathtaking throws in the offseason that remind you why he was picked where he was picked, but New England is a rebuilding team that believes it can give Maye as much time as he needs.\n\n\"And that's why the Patriots have Brissett, a reliable veteran who has been everything they hoped he would be so far both as a player and as a mentor for the rookie. Brissett threw three touchdown passes in three games last season with the Commanders and turned in a solid 62 QBR as the Browns' starter in 2022.\"\n\nMaye began spring practices working behind Brissett and Bailey Zappe but had passed Zappe on the depth chart by the end of the offseason program. With training camp underway, Mayo declared Brissett the starting quarterback for now, but left the door open for Maye depending on how he performs.\n\n\"Look, if Drake -- and this goes to any position -- if he comes out here and he lights it up. Once again, it goes back to quality of reps. It could absolutely happen,\" Mayo said last week, via the Boston Herald. \"Like, I sit here and tell you coming out of the spring, Jacoby looks like the starting quarterback. Now, with that being said, he'll have competition. Let's not forget about even Joe Milton. Let's not forget about Zappe.

Mandatory Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhile many expected Drake Maye to be the outright starter for the New England Patriots, HC Jared Meyo recently threw a curve ball by stating that Jacoby Brissett is currently the frontrunner for the job. This announcement raised concerns among the Patriots fanbase about Brissett's mentorship role, as he was now expected to compete with the rookie. Luckily for the New England faithful, their veteran QB is unfazed by the tricky relationship with his new teammate.\n\nIn his field-side chat with NFL broadcaster Kay Adams, Brissett admitted that his professionalism helps him navigate the tricky dynamic with Maye. While Jacoby affirmed his full commitment to competing for the QB1 position, he also revealed that he doesn't shy away from mentoring his rookie teammate with equal enthusiasm.\n\n\"I'm very confident in my skills and what I bring to the table as a player. [At the same time] it takes nothing away from me being a good person and just, you know, helping somebody.\"\n\nAccording to the veteran, his brief stint with Tom Brady taught him that assisting fellow QBs helps maintain the offensive standards of the team. So, for Brissett, the team's welfare is paramount, enabling him to seamlessly balance the roles of competing for QB1 and mentoring his competition.\n\n\"It doesn't cost anything to be a good teammate because if something happens to me, l want the next person to come in and I don't want the standard to change... When Tom was here, when Jimmy was here, we all competed against each other but we also helped each other [because] we wanted our room to be the best room.\"\n\nJacoby's attitude and professionalism in this tricky situation truly show his maturity. While he has never been an elite QB, his attitude and willingness to give his all for the team have been his strengths. Making this statement while his competition, Maye, is having a fabulous training camp speaks volumes about the confidence and security he has in his own skills.\n\nDespite entering the training camp with the psychological blow of being announced as the backup, Maye has done very well so far. His day 1 of the camp started with fewer reps than Brissett. Despite the limited playtime, Maye sizzled with a jaw-dropping, booming pass from deep.\n\nAs the days progressed, both the QBs started getting similar reps [18] and went toe to toe with each other. Maye's only blemish so far in the camp occurred yesterday, as it was the rookie's first NFL practice in pads. Supported by a subpar pass protection unit, Maye struggled throughout the day.\n\nRegardless, the quality exhibited in the first few days of camp should instill enough confidence in Patriots fans that their rookie is cut out for the mantle of Patriots' QB1.

There was another wonky snap-count situation -- half the line blocked and half remained in their pre-snap stance -- that led to a sack of Jacoby Brissett. There were five sacks in all for the offense before the practice was through. Pass-catchers also happened to drop five different passes over the course of the workout.\n\nAfter one of those drops, a miss by rookie wideout Javon Baker (who has been one of the offense's best players in recent practices), the entire offense was sent for a lap and then spoken to by head coach Jerod Mayo.\n\n\"We just kept jumping offsides,\" tight end Austin Hooper said later. \"We aren't figuring it out by talking to each other so let's run until we figure it out. We'll be a cross-country team or we'll be a football team. I'd rather be a football team.\"\n\nIt wasn't all bad for players on that side of the ball. The offensive line held its own during a one-on-one period, and starting quarterback Jacoby Brissett had one of his best days of camp.\n\nIn 11-on-11 periods, Brissett ended up going 8-for-9, and his lone incompletion was a drop by rookie wideout Ja'Lynn Polk. Late in the practice, the veteran quarterback heated up by hitting Javon Baker for an explosive gain down the right sideline. It appeared as though Brissett got the defense to go offsides and then used the \"free play\" to take a chance on a jump ball to the rookie.\n\nFour plays later, Brissett dropped an in-the-bucket completion to Tyquan Thornton down the right sideline again with Austin on the scene. The entire offense swarmed Thornton and actually knocked him down during the celebration.\n\nLayden Robinson, guard\n\nIt looked as though Robinson didn't lose any of his three reps in the early-practice one-on-one period, and his most decisive win might've come against New England's most experienced pass-rusher. Robinson used a jolting initial punch to knock Deatrich Wise back on contact. It also looked like Robinson executed solid blocks on a couple of long runs for the second-team offense during 11-on-11 periods.\n\nIf the rookie fourth-round pick out of Texas A&M can prove he's worthy of working his way up the depth chart, perhaps that would free up Mike Onwenu to move from right guard back out to tackle as the team looks for answers there.\n\nTyquan Thornton, wide receiver\n\nGive Thornton credit for making the most of his opportunities in this camp. He led the team with five catches on six targets on Day 2 of practice, but none of those passes featured his signature trait. On Monday, however, he was able to show off some speed. He beat Alex Austin down the right sideline and tracked the Jacoby Brissett pass over his shoulder for one of the best plays of the practice in a late 11-on-11 period. He also made a deep grab from Brissett in 7-on-7 work.\n\nThere's competition brewing at receiver behind DeMario \"Pop\" Douglas (still sitting out of team periods with a hand injury), Polk and Baker. Thornton, K.J. Osborn, Jalen Reagor, and Kayshon Boutte have all had positive moments in camp, and veteran JuJu Smith-Schuster remains part of the mix there as well.\n\nDrake Maye, quarterback\n\nThough the running game was the main focus of this fully-padded practice, Maye seemed to miss on a few opportunities to make some plays through the air. On Day 5, his feet didn't seem to be an obvious issue -- he improved from Day 3 to Day 4 in that regard -- but his accuracy was off at times. He went 2-for-6 in 7-on-7 work and then 1-for-4 in 11-on-11 periods.\n\nWe'll have full details on his showing in our daily Drake Maye Report, but it doesn't come as much of a surprise that the rookie's performance has been up and down of late. Day 3 looked tough for him. On Day 4, there was more good than bad. Monday was another session from which he'll be able to pull his share of learning moments.\n\nJosh Uche, linebacker\n\nWith Christian Barmore out (recently diagnosed with blood clots) and Matthew Judon looking like a hold-in on Monday, the pass-rush talent on the Patriots defense was considerably thinned. It got even thinner when Uche got into it after the whistle with right tackle Chuks Okorafor and was quickly sent off the field and back to the locker room.\n\nUche has shown in the past that he can be a factor on third downs -- he had 11.5 sacks in 2022 -- but the Patriots need him to keep himself on the field as much as possible in camp given the fluctuating nature of the availability of their top pass-rushers.\n\nMitchell Wilcox, tight end\n\nAustin Hooper has looked like the easy choice as New England's No. 2 tight end in recent practices. His hands have been consistent, and he's been targeted frequently by Jacoby Brissett. But the No. 3 tight end role seems more up for grabs.\n\nMitchell Wilcox -- in his fourth year after three with the Bengals -- may be the favorite, but Monday was a difficult day for him. Maye threw him a pass that was deflected and picked by Kyle Dugger in the lone 7-on-7 period of the day. He also had what could've been deemed two drops in 11-on-11 periods with Maye throwing him the football.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"},

Wide receivers, cornerbacks, linemen, they all pretty much will get thrown into the fire right away and start Day 1. The quarterback position is different, though, given how challenging it is and how far-reaching its impact.\n\nWhile plenty of teams do not shy away from starting their rookie QBs right out of the gate, not every quarterback is starter-level material from the get-go. The signs point toward Maye falling into the second category.\n\nIt is therefore no surprise that one of the brightest minds the NFL has ever seen is advising the Patriots to play it slow with their first-round investment.\n\n\"Essentially, you have married the franchise to Drake Maye for the next few years,\" former Patriots research director Ernie Adams said during a recent appearance on Julian Edelman's Games With Names podcast. \"They've got Jacoby Brissett in there for some period of time -- he may be the starting quarterback.\n\n\"If they asked me, which they haven't, when should they start Drake Maye: they should start him when he's ready. And you can't invent that. If he's not ready to start for the first week, don't start him. Maybe it's going to be the middle of the season or however that works out. But at some point, he's going to go in and be the quarterback and he's going to go a full chance to show what he can do.\"\n\nMaye entered the 2024 NFL Draft as one of the most physically-gifted players available. His combination of build, arm talent, and instincts was rare and made him a highly sought-after prospect. However, there were questions about his pro-readiness coming off an inconsistent two-year stretch as a starter at North Carolina.\n\nAs a consequence, he entered training camp as the No. 2 behind fellow offseason addition Jacoby Brissett. How soon he will push the veteran from the top spot remains to be seen. Six practices into camp it seems Brissett is still clearly ahead of the rookie.\n\nOnce decision time arrives -- whether in 2024 or 2025 -- Adams said that the Patriots need to go over the checklist to see if Maye is truly ready to take the reins.\n\n\"No. 1 thing, of course, is: how is he doing in practice? Taking snaps against the first defense, seeing NFL coverage, running the Patriots offense. Does he really know what he's doing? Does he look like he can execute at full speed against a really good defense when the bullets are flying?\" he said.\n\n\"It's a judgement call on the part of the coaches. You see him every day. You live with him. Does he really know how to call the plays in the huddle? Does he understand what you're trying to do? But there's nothing like going in. 'OK, we think he's ready, now we're going to put him in the game and now we really are going to find out.' Eventually, they are going to do that, and particularly the way that training camp has been so cut back ... it's going to slow down his development.\"\n\nMaye was drafted to become a starting quarterback at one point. When that point comes is anybody's guess at this point in time.\n\nIf the team heeds Ernie Adams' advice, though, there should be no pressure to get him into the starting lineup as quickly as possible.", "source": {"uri": "patspulpit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pats Pulpit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bernd_buchmasser@patspulpit.com", "name": "Bernd Buchmasser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Adams_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Adams (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_on_CBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL on CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GDig5oC0gIGuoSOGKRb3_OsiOfA=/0x110:3747x1984/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25553583/2163928225.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The 2024 third overall pick is 8-of-22 in team drills over the last two days with an interception. In one-on-ones he's been erratic at times, mainly with overthrows.\n\nThat's not to say it's time to hit the panic button. Maye's issues - while they do need to be worked on - aren't out of character for a rookie quarterback. The physical tools that were hyped during the draft are all easily apparent, it's more about the mental side coming along. Maye has to read and react much quicker to much more complex defensive looks at this level, and that adjustment should be expected to take time.\n\nFans and media can see what Maye is doing on the field, where the progress hasn't been immediate. On Tuesday though, multiple Patriots wide receivers talked about the work Maye is putting in behind the scenes in order to close the gap.\n\n\"Drake, man, he's a good quarterback. He's a great quarterback. Every single day, getting better,\" JuJu Smith-Schuster told reporters. \"One thing I love about him is that he likes to communicate. He likes to talk. So if something doesn't work, we always going to film room. We talk about it, we fix it, we come back out here and do it again.\"\n\nJalen Reagor, who has repped with Maye regularly during camp, also highlighted the work Maye is putting in off the field. \"He's a student, for sure. He likes to learn,\" Reagor noted. \"He's always talking to Jacoby [Brissett]. Learning. Jacoby's a great vet to learn from. He's always talking to AVP [Alex Van Pelt] and talking to us, of course, to see what - how we like things and certain routes, where we want the ball and stuff like that. So he's a student of the game, for sure.\"\n\n\"He's got a lot of arm talent. So whenever he does get more opportunities, he's going to show you guys how great he really is,\" Reagor added. \"There's a reason he went where he went [in the NFL Draft].

However, after seeing how Jacoby Brissett performed in the Patriots first padded practice of 2024, it's clear who looks like the team's Week 1 starter.\n\nMonday marked the fifth day of Patriots training and the first with contact. It also marked the best practice Brissett had since joining the Patriots this offseason.\n\nHe went 8-of-9 in full-team drills with his only incomplete pass hitting the fingertips of Ja'Lynn Polk. Brissett also went 4-of-6 in 7-on-7 drills and overall, completed 12-of-14 passes in this competitive session.\n\nThe 31-year-old finished practice with two highlight-reel deep throws to Javon Baker and Tyquan Thornton. The pass to Baker was around 30 yards, and the rookie receiver jumped up and over Alex Austin and Jaylinn Hawkins for a great catch. Two snaps later, Brissett had his best pass of camp, dropping a dime over the shoulders of Tyquan Thornton. The receiver hung on to make a nice catch with Austin tight on his hip.\n\nOverall, it was a strong performance for a veteran quarterback, who maintains a sizable lead over his competition.\n\nConversely, Drake Maye had his worst outing of training camp. The No. 3 overall pick went 3-of-11 with an interception and was plagued by accuracy issues throughout the session.\n\nTrouble for Maye started during the first and only 7-on-7 period. The young quarterback threw behind LaMichael Pettway with his first attempt. After connecting with tight end Jacob Warren, Maye threw behind tight end Mitchell Wilcox and was intercepted by Kyle Dugger.\n\nMaye rebounded by hitting Kayshon Boutte for a small gain but ended the period overthrowing receiver Kawaan Baker and having a miscommunication with receiver David Wallis as the ball fell incomplete nowhere near his target. After going 2-of-6 in 7-on-7s, Maye went 1-of-5 in full-team drills.\n\nMaye hit Baker for his first completion but finished practice with four straight incomplete passes and a sack on his last five dropbacks. Out of his four incomplete passes, one was a throwaway, one was dropped (by Wilcox) and the other two were off the mark.\n\nJoe Milton III and Bailey Zappe received fewer reps on Monday. Neither threw during 7-on-7s. Milton ran two 11-on-11 periods, going 4-of-5. Zappe received reps in one full-team period, finishing 2-of-4.\n\nMilton's day didn't start great as he fumbled a handoff on his second snap. The coaches took him off the field for one play after that. The sixth-round pick returned and connected on 4-of-5 passes. His only incomplete pass was dropped by Baker.\n\nFollowing the drop, coaches weren't pleased with the offense's effort and forced the entire unit to run a lap.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyquan_Thornton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyquan Thornton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylinn_Hawkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylinn Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incomplete pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Wilcox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayshon_Boutte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kayshon Boutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Dugger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Dugger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/NJGJORZ5KVHJZEGXBRTNCZK3E4.jpg?auth=16eb73a8cc609379bcf08a9f2bf3dbbc9406e385d9fa5f3b7aac09f300170531&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

But the most important thing is getting an offensive line in front of this kid and having him develop. Now, you can develop him without him playing. That's also a possibility. I don't want this kid to get killed. Holley and I had this arguement. Holly seems to think this team is capable of winning 6 or 7 games this year.\n\nToucher: Whatever. That's not like a bold statement. Fine, they could win 6 or 7 games. Big deal they go six and 11, or they go seven and ten. Here's what I would root for if I was a Patriots fan. The team's not going to make the playoffs. So what I would want is for the team to get progressively better, and then I would even make the argument that since they have their quarterback, that at the end of the season, I would want them winning games.

Joe Milton reportedly outplaying Drake Maye during New England Patriots training camp", "body": "After trading Mac Jones for a bag of footballs, the New England Patriots had a desperate need to upgrade the quarterback position during the 2024 offseason. So when it came to make their selection with the third overall pick, selecting the best QB available, Drake Maye, seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nOf course, the Patriots could have always traded down and likely collected a massive haul of draft assets, including a 2025 first-round pick. But they didn't. Another option would have been to select J.J. McCarthy, Michael Penix, or Bo Nix. The point is, the Patriots didn't have to take Maye. They had plenty of options.\n\nOnly, New England did draft the North Carolina star. Yet, the Patriots also drafted the cannon-armed Joe Milton with the 193rd overall pick in the draft, too. It's not quite a Robert Griffin III-Kirk Cousins scenario, when Washington traded up to take RGIII, only to select Cousins in the fourth round. But it's not far off.\n\nWashington's awkward approach ultimately somewhat worked out. They couldn't have ever predicted that Griffin would get hurt. But seeing Cousins become a four-time Pro Bowl quarterback justified their selection, even if they didn't want to pay him market value.\n\nBut for New England, taking a shot on Milton in the sixth round also made a lot of sense, even if it sets up a unique scenario in the locker room. From a practical sense, there's no reason why Maye should be worried about a sixth-round selection, yet, based on early returns from Patriots camp, maybe he should be concerned.\n\nRelated: 10 NFL teams that will disappoint in 2024, including the Chicago Bears and Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe New England Patriots wrapped up a two-hour padded practice on Tuesday, one of the first true tests of the offseason. Yet, the offense was far from flawless.\n\nAccording to the Boston Globe's Patriots insider Ben Volin, Drake Maye has been getting outplayed by Joe Milton.\n\n\"Drake Maye continues to underwhelm while Joe Milton impresses. I wrote after last Thursday's practice that Milton is the \"wow\" quarterback at camp -- the guy with the best size, best athleticism, and biggest arm. Now I'll take it a step further: Milton outplayed Maye over the first six practices of camp. You can't tell which player is the No. 3 overall pick (Maye) and which is the sixth-round flier (Milton).\n\nMaye is running second on the depth chart and getting a ton of work, but he hasn't made many noteworthy throws. He was the only quarterback not to throw a touchdown pass in a red zone drill Tuesday, while Milton, in limited reps, threw touchdowns on consecutive plays, one on a drag to Polk and another on an RPO slant to JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nIn the red zone/two-minute situation, Maye had an ugly, off-platform throw that went way wide of Smith-Schuster, a hospital ball to tight end Mitchell Wilcox that got him sandwiched between two defenders, and an incomplete corner fade to Javon Baker in the end zone that had the entire offense doing pushups.\n\nMeanwhile, Milton wows the crowd every day with his tantalizing arm and standing backflips. After Maye struggled in the red zone, Milton promptly came in and completed a nice pass to Kawaan Baker on the sideline.\"\n\nIt's great that Bazooka Joe Milton is vindicating the Patriots' confidence in him. But if this trend continues, how long until the locker room wants to see what the sixth-round rookie can do, instead of the third overall pick?\n\nMaye has a lot of time to figure it out. The Patriots don't kick off their season until September 8, and he may not even be the starter, thanks to Jacoby Brissett's presence.

Godchaux has been vocal about his desire for a pay raise, and the Patriots suddenly need him even more now that Christian Barmore is out for an indefinite period with blood clots.\n\nIn addition, center David Andrews also was a surprise no-show, and edge rusher Josh Uche was sent to the locker room early for getting into a fight with right tackle Chukwuma Okorafor.\n\nThe practice was a mess, mostly for the offense. Four players on that side of the ball were sent off for penalty laps before coach Jerod Mayo sent the entire offense off for a penalty lap. Drake Maye threw a pick-6 and had an ugly period in 7-on-7 drills. There were far more drops and sacks than cheers from the fans after a big play.\n\nAfter five days of camp, the defense may have scored more touchdowns than the offense.\n\nMayo gave the team a nice talking-to after practice, as did linebacker Ja'Whaun Bentley. The first day in pads probably couldn't have gone much worse.\n\n2. An especially rough day for Maye. I don't want to hyperanalyze Maye's performance early in camp, since he's just a rookie and these practices are designed for learning and making mistakes. But the first week certainly has been slow going for the No. 3 overall pick, especially Monday.\n\nIn seven-on-seven, Maye threw a sideline pass to Hunter Henry that was picked off by Kyle Dugger and returned for a touchdown. Maye's next two plays were wild throws down the middle that weren't close to being completed and were lucky to not be intercepted.\n\nLater in 11-on-11 drills, Maye uncorked an awkward throw after looking like he got stepped on by a lineman. He looked to be OK, though, as he rolled to his right on his next pass, a wild throw out of bounds.\n\nMaye is getting a ton of reps and every opportunity to compete with Jacoby Brissett and win the job. But he has made only a smattering of nice throws, showing inconsistency with his deep ball, and hasn't made any \"wow\" plays with his athleticism or arm strength.\n\n3. Decent start for the run game. One positive was that the run game appeared to have a solid start on the first day of contact. Kevin Harris broke up a boring practice with an exciting run up the middle in 11-on-11 drills.

But instead of calling on Bailey Zappe or Joe Milton to finish the 11-on-11 drill, as they had the previous five practices, the coaching staff put Maye back on the field.\n\nThree snaps versus the third-team defense. Let's see what you've got.\n\nMaye followed with a quick completion into the flat, one harried scramble and an outside hand-off.\n\nThat was Maye's day.\n\nFar from mayday, but unquestionably a third straight disappointment authored by the future of the franchise. Maye has been gun shy -- completing multiple passes longer than 10 yards in just half of the team's practices -- and scattershot. Maye barely hit 50% of his passes during initial 1-on-1s, throwing against one defender and no pass rush.\n\nThree times in camp, Maye has been forced to stop and reset either his huddle or an entire play due to pre-snap problems. Rookie mistakes, surely, but the Patriots must be hoping some growth will soon follow what have been extended growing pains. Their off day Wednesday feels well-timed.\n\nElsewhere at Tuesday's padded practice, Matt Judon was missing, Ja'Lynn Polk made the play of the day, Keion White took no prisoners, a young defensive back starred in Jabrill Peppers' absence and the starting offensive line continues to settle.\n\nHere are the Herald's complete practice observations:\n\nAbsent: OLB Matt Judon, S Jabrill Peppers, C David Andrews\n\nNon-contact jersey: WR DeMario Douglas, CB Shaun Wade\n\nPUP: WR Kendrick Bourne, LB Sione Takitaki, OL Cole Strange, C/G Jake Andrews\n\nNotes: Judon was fully absent after mostly sitting out Monday's practice, when he confronted director of player personnel Matt Groh. Andrews missed his second straight practice due to a personal issue, but is not expected to be out long-term, per sources. Peppers and Bell didn't participate after being limited Monday. Like Mapu, they watched part of practice. Peppers wore a sleeve on his left leg.\n\nDouglas donned a non-contact jersey for the first time in camp, and is dealing with a hand injury. He participated in 7-on-7s, but not full-team periods.\n\nJa'Lynn Polk high-points a touchdown\n\nDuring opening positional drills, the wide receivers drilled sluggo routes: slant-and-gos. Playing catch with the quarterbacks, they burst straight upfield for five yards or so, then angled inside for a few steps before taking off straight upfield again looking for a deep ball. Most passes in the drill were completed.\n\nThirty minutes later, that groundwork paid off for Ja'Lynn Polk.\n\nPolk beat backup cornerback Marco Wilson on this exact route for a 20-yard score during 7-on-7s midway through practice. Jacoby Brissett lofted a perfect ball toward the front left pylon of the end zone, Polk rose up and snatched it, maintaining possession through his fall to the ground.\n\nWhite has arguably been the Patriots' best player in training camp, and strengthened his case Tuesday. White tallied another run stuff and two pressures playing all across the defensive line during team periods. He also thrived for most of 1-on-1 pass rush, beating Mike Onwenu for the final rep of practice.\n\nThe former second-round pick is tracking for a breakout year.\n\nNote: The passing stats below were tallied during competitive 7-on-7 and 11-on-11 periods only. The stats in parentheses represent the quarterbacks' camp-long performance.\n\nNotes: In a classic case of stats not telling the full story, Brissett was far and away the better quarterback Tuesday, despite posting an identical completion percentage.\n\nBrissett delivered the three best throws of practice: the 20-yard touchdown to Polk, another 20-yard score to Hunter Henry down the seam in red-zone work and a deep cross to K.J. Osborn he layered between two zone defenders, allowing Osborn to sprint into the downfield window for a catch. Meanwhile, Maye didn't complete a single pass longer than 10 yards downfield.\n\nIn fact, five of his eight completions during team periods were checkdowns and/or to receivers in the flat. Downfield, Maye missed a wide-open Osborn, running another sluggo route, during 7-on-7s for a would-be touchdown. He punctuated his day with a so-so fade throw that backup corner Shaun Wade knocked away from Javon Baker, forcing the entire offense to take pushups.\n\nBefore then, Maye zeroed in on fellow rookies Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker, but went 1-of-5 targeting them in the last 11-on-11 period. He had two bad misses, two other passes broken up (including Wade's) and hit Polk on a shallow cross. Chemistry, like development, will take time.\n\nDrake Maye watch: Patriots rookie QB struggles again in second day in pads\n\nA sixth-round pick in 2021, Bledsoe has logged just 32 snaps in his NFL career and remains firmly on the roster bubble this summer. But with Jabrill Peppers out, he stepped in and stepped up Tuesday.\n\nOn the second snap of 11-on-11s, Bledsoe knocked down a Brissett pass over the middle intended for Hunter Henry. Later, he stopped a potential touchdown to Austin Hooper. Bledsoe smothered Hooper at the catch point in the end zone and was instantly swarmed by nearby teammates after deflecting the pass away.\n\nWR Ja'Lynn Polk\n\nNo one had more catches in team periods than the second-round rookie, who caught passes from all three quarterbacks and finished with four total. Polk hasn't matched the flash of fellow rookie Javon Baker, but he has been steadier. He brought both steak and sizzle on Tuesday.\n\nNone of the Patriots' offensive units managed much success on the ground, yielding run stuffs on seven of 16 run plays (excluding scrambles and a fumbled hand-off). This marked a significant step back from Monday, when Rhamondre Stevenson, Antonio Gibson and Kevin Harris all hit long runs.\n\nQB Drake Maye\n\nRough day for the rookie, even if his mistakes weren't as glaring as those on Monday when he went 3-of-11 with an interception.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_callahan@bostonherald.com", "name": "Andrew Callahan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabrill_Peppers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jabrill Peppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keion_White", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keion White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Wade_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaun Wade (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_scramble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback scramble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Andrews_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Andrews (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Bourne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Bourne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_unable_to_perform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physically unable to perform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Hooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Hooper"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tsnl021.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Eric Canha-USA TODAY Sports / Eric Canha-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New England Patriots drafted North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye with the understanding that he might not be ready to roll from Day 1 of training camp.\n\nThis is why they brought back the ultimate bridge quarterback Jacoby Brissett to New England to give Maye a mentor and provide them some starts while they continue to improve their roster. Let's face it, the offensive skill players are currently led by running back Rhamondre Stevenson and rookie wide receivers Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker.\n\nThis environment is not suitable for a rookie quarterback to step into right away. And Maye is proving he might need some time to continue to get used to an NFL playbook and the speed of the game at this level.\n\nCLNS's beat writer Taylor Kyles had this to say about Maye's learning curve:\n\nThe Maye-led offense also had to re-huddle after a pre-snap error, and there was a fumbled handoff attempt to Kevin Harris, though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure who was at fault. Pass rush was once again an issue behind the second line, as Maye was forced into some quick decisions and looked uncomfortable going through reads. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to know how much of Maye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uneasiness is due to protection and how much is the speed of the pro game, the rookie has understandably underwhelmed this week.\n\nWhat Maye does do well, as Kyles pointed out in the same article, is the unspectacular, starting with his downfield throws. This was the strength of Maye's game at North Carolina, and will continue to be where he can pick up massive chunks for the offense whenever he does come on the field in New England.\n\nWhile Maye is often compared to Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers, perhaps Josh Allen coming out of Wyoming is a better situation to compare the No. 3 overall pick to. Allen had a learning curve coming from Wyoming, had to completely rework his footwork, known as extremely inaccurate coming out of college, and even struggled early in his career. The Bills even started Nathan Peterman over Allen early in his career.\n\nBut Allen can always connect on those chunk plays when his team needs a big play the most. While Maye may need more refinement working the short game and underneath action, we may see a similar trajectory in New England.

That's why Mayo sent the entire group for a lap around the Patriots practice field.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mayo was visibly upset with the offense following a pre-snap penalty in full-team drills. That's why he sent the entire offense off and running for their second penalty lap in as many days.\n\n\"We've got to get on our stuff,\" offensive lineman Michael Onwenu said. \"Too many bad plays. Too many mental errors. We need to fix that.\"\n\n\"Just accountability,\" added running back Rhamondre Stevenson. \"Just doing the right thing every play even when we're tired. When we fail to do that, there's consequences.\"\n\nThe Patriots offense didn't exactly flourish on Tuesday. Jacoby Brissett and his unit had some positive moments but weren't as efficient as Monday. For the second straight practice, Drake Maye struggled as the pieces around him fell apart on multiple occasions.\n\nThere are clear growing pains for the Patriots when it comes to learning a new offensive system. Add that factor in with the team's lack of continuity on the offensive line and it's understandable why there have been some tough moments for the group this summer.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brissett finished 7-of-15 overall. The veteran went 5-of-11 in full-team drills and 2-of-4 in 7-on-7s. In full team drills, two of his incomplete passes were deflected by Joshuah Bledsoe, one was thrown away, one was dropped by JuJu Smith-Schuster and two were off the mark.\n\nBrissett's last 11-on-11 period also featured the offense getting yelled at by Mayo and being forced to run a lap.\n\nMaye had a good start to Tuesday's session going 3-of-4 in full-team drills. His unit, however, looked sloppy in the third 11-on-11 period. Maye went 1-of-6 and everything from the offensive line to the receivers fell apart.\n\nFourth-string center Atonio Mafi was with Maye since David Andrews was out. To start this period, Mafi had a poor snap that directly affected the timing of Maye's pass to tight end Mitchell Wilcox, which is why it fell incomplete. The next dropback was a sack by Keion White, who looked unblocked. The next snap was a handoff to Kevin Harris and the running back fumbled the ball, which was scooped by cornerback Marco Wilson, who scored.\n\nMaye's next pass was deflected by Wilson. Running back JaMycal Hasty was stuffed after that. Maye then missed Ja'Lynn Polk before hitting the rookie receiver for his only completion of this period.\n\nThings went so poorly that the coaching staff had Maye come back out, with the third-string offense, to run three more reps.\n\nMaye went 8-of-15 total on Tuesday. That included him completing 5-of-11 passes in full-team drills and going 3-of-4 in 7-on-7s. The rookie is 11-of-26 with an interception over the last days of camp, which marked the first two practices in pads.\n\nJoe Milton III and Bailey Zappe split reps on Tuesday.

It was also the hottest day by a decent margin. The practice featured Red Zone work for the first time since camp began, including 7-on-7s and 11-on-11s.\n\nMatt Judon, who made headlines Monday over a contentious hold-in attempt, was a no-show today. According to NBC Sports Boston's Phil Perry, Judon wasn't at the facility due to a \"sizable gap in what Judon is looking for and what the Patriots have offered.\n\nJabrill Peppers was absent after appearing to suffer a lower-body injury yesterday. Marte Mapu and Jaheim Bell watched practice from the sidelines in jerseys but no pads. Mapu appeared to be taking mental reps behind the defense during full-field team work.\n\nDeMario Douglas wore a red non-contact jersey for the first time in camp and finally saw action in team drills. He only took a few reps, but one was a goal line touchdown on a quick out from Drake Maye. He also looked great attacking passes before practice.\n\nShaun Wade was once again in a red non-contact jersey in a red jersey. He had an impressive breakup on a backshoulder fade to Javon Baker that led to pushups for the offense.\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster limped off the field with trainers late in today's practice. According to the receiver, he hurt himself after tripping on a rock.\n\nHere are my top observations from today's practice.\n\nQuarterbacks Struggle in Competitive Practice\n\nJacoby Brissett and Drake Maye have essentially alternated positive performances in training camp. Maye took a slight lead early, but Brissett pulled ahead with strong outings on Sunday and Monday. But today, both veteran and rookie had mostly subpar performances.\n\nBrissett was nearly picked by Joshuah Bledsoe during an early 11-on-11 drill, throwing behind Hunter Henry on a crossing route. When the team moved into scoring territory, two of his passes sailed over their target before he rebounded with a tight-window throw to Henry in the back of the end zone. Later, with the full field at his disposal, Brissett threw well behind Jalen Reagor on a slant, then put another Reagor target low over the middle. Brissett's inconsistency was odd, given his usual accuracy and the time provided on most dropbacks. Still, there were a few positive moments. The veteran had one of the throws of the day to Ja'Lynn Polk in the corner of the end zone during Red Zone. He also bounced back after the offense ran a lap for an illegal substitution, hitting KJ Osborn on a crossing route and getting fired up. Brissett will look to have a more complete performance on Thursday.\n\nMaye looked as accurate as he has all summer during warm-ups, throws on air, and 1-on-1s.\n\nThis was most evident on out-breaking routes, where he often misses high or behind. The rookie was solid, if unspectacular, early in team drills, finding his outlets and attacking underneath. Things got dicier from there, including an overthrown double-move to Osborn, a short throw behind Mitchell Wilcox where the tight end was sandwiched by defenders, and a high throw on a bootleg to his left. The Maye-led offense also had to re-huddle after a pre-snap error, and there was a fumbled handoff attempt to Kevin Harris, though I'm not sure who was at fault. Pass rush was once again an issue behind the second line, as Maye was forced into some quick decisions and looked uncomfortable going through reads. While it's impossible to know how much of Maye's uneasiness is due to protection and how much is the speed of the pro game, the rookie has understandably underwhelmed this week.\n\nBefore fans hit the panic button, Reagor offered some optimism after practice, telling reporters, \"Whenever he does get more opportunities, he's going to show you guys how great he really is and why he went where he went.\"\n\nNone of the issues we've seen from Maye are things that weren't on his college tape. He also deserves credit for consistently protecting the football. There's still plenty of offseason left, but Jacoby Brissett being the starter for Week 1 and beyond feels like more of a reality by the day.\n\nJoe Milton and Bailey Zappe continue to switch off during team periods, but Milton had three sets of reps while Zappe had one. Milton could still take some heat off of passes, but he was accurate and has seemingly made a point of attacking underneath. During low Red Zone drills, he threw a touchdown to Polk and fit another to Smith-Schuster in a tight window. Zappe could be losing ground in the QB3 competition.\n\nYoung Wide Receivers Stacking Good Days\n\nNot much is expected of the Patriots' receiving corps externally, but their young receivers have earned their flowers.\n\nWith Douglas limited, Ja'Lynn Polk continues to work with the top offense in the slot and at Z. He picked up where he left off this spring during Red Zone work, making a high-point grab on a fade and beating Shaun Wade on a quick out. Polk also had a strong 1-on-1 period, including a contested grab near the sideline with Marcus Jones on his hip.\n\nIt's still early, but with the rookie's consistency and reliability, Polk feels like a day-one starter for the Patriots' offense.\n\nBaker didn't have any spectacular grabs today, but he was consistently open deep during 1-on-1s. I watched at least four reps where he decisively stacked or blew past his defender, but was well over or underthrown. Reagor mentioned the wind during that portion of practice during interviews, so that could have played a factor. Baker will have to fend off Reagor and Tyquan Thornton before earning the top X spot, but I would be stunned if he doesn't have a significant role from the jump as an ISO specialist.\n\nSpeaking of Thornton, he's missed just one practice since the spring and is catching everything thrown his way in camp. This included a 1-on-1 win against Marco Wilson that drew a vocal response from Brissett. If he carries this consistency over over into games, Thornton's dynamic speed makes him a near-lock.\n\nKayshon Boutte also deserves credit, bringing in difficult passes regularly since the last day of minicamp. He's had a deep catch in each 1-on-1s session, including a beauty today where Marcus Jones had near-perfect coverage.\n\nEven journeyman Jalen Reagor has shown up in the deep passing game on a daily basis.\n\nLast training camp, DeVante Parker was the Patriots' only viable deep threat. This year, nearly every receiver with a shot at the roster has made plays with some consistency.\n\nTop Offensive Line Remains Consistent and Competitive\n\nThe Patriots may have found their best five offensive line combination. Outside of Nick Leverett, who's subbed in for David Andrews the past two days, the unit stayed steady for a third straight day. Caedan Wallace has been locked into the left side with Chukwuma Okorafor flanking him on the right. Wallace had a few more losses than yesterday, but has been impressive overall.\n\nJacoby Brissett had another day of largely clean pockets. The added contact of padded practices has appeared to benefit the unit, with Sidy Sow saying yesterday that he ended a pass pro rep with a single, well-executed punch. The run game wasn't as consistent as yesterday, but it was competitive against a stout Patriots front. Rhamondre Stevenson and Kevin Harris each had a pair of big gains, which came on both gap and outside zone concepts.\n\nNew England's second line has struggled significantly more than the starters. Layden Robinson seeming to take a step back after a strong performance yesterday, and Vederian Lowe hasn't looked great on the right side. Calvin Anderson has been the group's one bright spot at left tackle and hasn't given up much pressure.\n\nOverall, for a group that most expected to be a glaring weakness this season, the Patriots' offensive line has impressed, particularly at the top. Not having to face Judon or Christian Barmore can't be overlooked, but credit where it's due.", "source": {"uri": "clnsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CLNS Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taylor_kyles@clnsmedia.com", "name": "Taylor Kyles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaheim_Bell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaheim Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marte_Mapu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marte Mapu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshuah_Bledsoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshuah Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Wade_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaun Wade (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JuJu_Smith-Schuster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JuJu Smith-Schuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabrill_Peppers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jabrill Peppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Wilcox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Jones_(cornerback)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Jones (cornerback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harris_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harris (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Reagor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Reagor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleg_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bootleg play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_rush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pass rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidy_Sow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sidy Sow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukwuma_Okorafor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chukwuma Okorafor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeVante_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeVante Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Andrews_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Andrews (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.clnsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI_23816177-e1722375851122.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

He played sparingly last year with the Washington Commanders. Brissett started his career in New England back in 2016. He also played for the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nBrissett has had an up and down NFL career. He had one 3,000 yard passing season, in 2017 with Indianapolis. In 2022, he threw for 2,608 yards and 12 touchdowns with the Browns. He has 10,574 career passing yards, with 51 touchdowns and 23 interceptions.\n\nMaye may not be the Week 1 starter, but he is seen as the long-term future for the team. The Patriots rookie was taken as the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nMaye had an excellent career in college playing for North Carolina. He was named the ACC Rookie of the Year in 2022. That season he also won Player of the Year and Offensive Player of the Year honors in the league. In his career, Maye threw for 8,018 yards in a little more than two full seasons. He had 63 touchdown passes, with only 16 interceptions.\n\nThat was in college, however, and the pros are a different ball game. Maye is working on several facets of his game this offseason. One area of emphasis is his footwork. Maye's feet appear restless at times.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make it where I'm not missing the read or not necessarily missing the read, but [I'm] not getting through the read as quickly as I need to out here more than one time in a row,\" Maye said, per Fox Sports. \"If I make the same mistake [next week], then I'm not making progress, So trying to keep that balance and keep going at it. You're going to keep making mistakes. That's what practice is for.\"\n\nPatriots fans are certainly interested to see how the quarterback competition progresses into the regular season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_adducchio@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Benjamin Adducchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Patriots-news-Jacoby-Brissetts-confident-approach-to-Drake-Maye-QB-competition.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

After Tuesday's session, however, veteran wide receiver Jalen Reagor gave Maye a vote of confidence.\n\n\"He's got a lot of arm talent,\" Reagor said of Maye. \"Whenever he does get more opportunities, he's gonna show you guys how great he really is.

That trend continued on Tuesday -- the sixth day of camp -- and there was plenty more to unpack, too.\n\nHere are nine takeaways from a toasty Tuesday on the backfields at Gillette Stadium:\n\n1. Maye's growing pains continue\n\nMaye is green and he's looked it thus far. As the No. 3 overall pick acclimates to his first NFL training camp, it's important to remember he's still just 21 years old. J.J. McCarthy was the only younger quarterback in Maye's draft class, and for perspective, his fellow rookie Joe Milton is 24 years old. With the second offense, Maye went 8-for-15 in competitive drills and endured one of the toughest 11-on-11 periods of camp.\n\nAfter opening with an incompletion into heavy traffic, Maye took a would-be sack from Keion White and delivered an incompletion as the rep continued. That was followed by a Kevin Harris fumble -- Marco Wilson scooped and scored -- a ball to Javon Baker that was broken up by Wilson, a run stuff, and another incompletion that could have been a sack from White. The period concluded with a completion to Ja'Lynn Polk, a JaMycal Hasty no-gain, and with pushups on the line for the final rep, Maye looked Baker's way again, but his pass was broken up by Shaun Wade in the end zone.\n\nThose final numbers are 1-for-6 with two potential sacks and a messy running game, though obviously, some of this could be attributed to offensive line play, too; it wasn't just Maye. It hasn't helped his cause that Atonio Mafi has been trying to transition to center and his snaps have been as consistent as an Angel Hernandez strike zone.\n\n2. Mixed bag for the starters\n\nAs for the first team offense, there were two ways to look at their day on Tuesday.\n\nGlass half full: The run game looks to be progressing well and they're building momentum on the ground now that they're in pads.\n\n\"(The running game is) very important. That's tough football,\" Rhamondre Stevenson said. \"That's what I think, our players think and our coaches think so. We've got to run the ball, stop the run and cover kicks. That's tough football.\"\n\nGlass half empty: The passing game wasn't great and the overall operation was still so messy that the entire offense needed to take a lap. At one point, Brissett's group needed to re-huddle, and the quarterback let his group know that it wasn't acceptable. Mayo felt the same way, sending them on a trek around the far goal posts as punishment.\n\n3. Judon is MIA\n\nAfter his bizarre showing Monday, Matthew Judon was a no-show on Tuesday.\n\nUnhappy with his contract, the four-time Pro Bowler didn't participate in New England's first padded practice and had animated conversations with Jerod Mayo and then Matt Groh and Eliot Wolf, departing after each respective chat.\n\nWhile he hasn't had the same highlight reel frequency as fellow rookie Javon Baker, Ja'Lynn Polk is emerging as one of the offense's steadiest wideouts. While some teammates are up and down, it feels like every practice Polk good for a handful of receptions.\n\nThat was the case on Tuesday, as he caught passes from Brissett and Maye in team drills, and went 3-1 in his 1-on-1s, beating Marcus Jones, Alex Austin, and Marcellas Dial Jr., while losing one rep to Isaiah Bolden. As camp rolls on, Polk is continuing to build momentum.\n\n5. Less surprisingly, Henry does too\n\nHunter Henry was another standout on Tuesday, though that's to be expected of the captain, especially with Jabrill Peppers on the shelf. Henry beat Josh Bledsoe decisively in a pair of 1-on-1 reps, catching one while the other was overthrown, then caught a touchdown in 11-on-11s from Brissett with Bledsoe in coverage once again. He looks ready to roll.\n\n6. Godchaux participates, chats with Kraft\n\nThough also unhappy with his contract, Davon Godchaux has been a full participant in both of New England's padded practices. When Robert Kraft arrived during the second hour of practice, he sought Godchaux out on the sideline and had a brief conversation with him.\n\n7. Same offensive line\n\nThe Patriots are finding some continuity with their starting offensive line, as Caedan Wallace (left) and Chuks Okorafor (right) appear to have settled into the first team tackle spots. As the pads have come on, they've both held up reasonably well. It's too bad Judon has opted out of these practices, because that'd be a whole different test.\n\n8. White continues to impress\n\nKeion White is the one defensive player that is impossible not to notice this summer.\n\nHe was terrorizing the backup offensive line in Maye's rough 11-on-11 series -- he was in the backfield for two would-be sacks -- and continues to stand out in individual drills, too. One of Jerod Mayo's offseason award winners, White could be in for a monster season.\n\nThe Patriots were also without Jabrill Peppers, David Andrews, Christian Barmore, Jaheim Bell and Marte Mapu, along with the PUP guys: Sione Takitaki, Cole Strange, Jake Andrews and Kendrick Bourne, who warmed up with the team and then went to the conditioning fields.\n\nAfter getting banged up on Monday, Peppers arrived near the end of practice with a compression sleeve on his left leg.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Was it the defense making a play, or the offense being poorly executed? There was a little of both during the Patriots' sixth practice of 2024 training camp, but when Maye took the field with the No. 2 offensive line and mainly backup receivers, that's when the Pats' offensive struggles were amplified.\n\nThat being said, there's a silver lining to every dark cloud, and for this team, it's that the projected starting offense with Jacoby Brissett continues to make some plays. Although, it also wasn't a perfect day for them, either; at one point, Brissett and the O-line appeared to mess up their alignment coming out of the huddle, prompting an outburst from Brissett and a penalty lap around the field for the entire offense.\n\nMORE: Matthew Judon contract situation takes a tumultuous turn\n\nWith that in mind, here are 11 non-quarterback players that stood out on day 6 of Patriots training camp, for one reason or another, some good, some bad...\n\n\"Pop\" Douglas stood out in this practice because he finally got to rep in team drills. The second-year slot receiver practiced in a red non-contact jersey, so he's still somewhat limited physically as he works his way back from a hand injury. But the Patriots have yet to do live tackling in competitive drills, so Douglas was able to get out there and rep with the rest of the team like normal.\n\nDouglas made one catch in 7-on-7 on Tuesday, on a nice ball from Maye, while regularly getting work in individual drills and side sessions with the quarterbacks as well. He told reporters this week that he's \"good\" in his recovery from the hand injury. It appears the team still wants to gradually ramp up the physicality with him.\n\nDouglas figures to be a key piece of the Pats' new offense under Alex Van Pelt, after an impressive showing when he got on the field as a rookie. There have been a lot of quick passes over the middle in team drills, and tons of play-action, so if and when Douglas lines up as the Pats' primary slot target, he should have plenty of opportunities to get open.\n\nThe veteran stood out in a bad way on Tuesday. He had the most egregious drop of practice, as he got wide open on an out route to the left sideline but bobbled the ball out of his hands. He later caught a pass from rookie Joe Milton III in 11-on-11, but there's more weight to the drop with the starters than the catch with the third-stringers.\n\nSmith-Schuster may be on the books for $6.5 million this season, but from a pure football standpoint, he's not performing well enough in camp to justify a roster spot right now.\n\nHenry and Brissett connected for the best passing play of the day in 11-on-11. Working out of the red zone for the first time all camp, Brissett threaded the needle to Henry over the shoulder of safety Joshuah Bledsoe for a \"touchdown.\" That got the whole offense fired up for a celebration as if it had happened in a game.\n\nDon't forget about Henry. He may yet be the Patriots' most consistently reliable pass-catcher, considering the uncertainty at wide receiver. He sure looks like he can still be a red zone threat, based on Tuesday.\n\nWilcox appears to be in the lead for the third tight end spot behind Henry and Austin Hooper. He's known mainly for his blocking, which the Pats are surely going to need for their zone-based running game, but he also made two catches in 11-on-11, one each from Brissett and Maye. He also had one target broken up by linebacker Christian Elliss, but overall, a solid day for Wilcox.\n\nHarris stood out in the worst possible way on Tuesday. He and Maye botched a handoff during one 11-on-11 drill, which cornerback Marco Wilson recovered for what could've been a scoop & score in a real game. From our vantage point, Harris had the handoff in his hands alone and simply dropped it to the turf. A tough moment for the third-year back, who is competing for snaps with Antonio Gibson, and possibly for a roster spot with JaMycal Hasty, Deshaun Fenwick, and Terrell Jennings.\n\nMafi has been repping as the No. 2 center with Maye, and his snaps have been all over the place. He continued to spray the ball all over the field, which appears to be messing with Maye's timing in team drills.\n\nThe rookie could certainly handle the adversity better, but it's hard to gauge his actual progress when guys around him aren't executing. Mafi is (pardon the pun) at the center of those issues right now.\n\nCredit Godchaux with a sack and two total pressures on the interior during 11-on-11, which came against the starting offensive line. It's possible he's made progress on his contract with the Patriots, after his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, attended practice on Monday.\n\nGodchaux is back to practicing in full, and, especially if the Patriots are going to be without Christian Barmore for extended time, they're really going to need him.\n\nWhite disrupted things off the edge against both the run and the pass in 11-on-11, and also dominated his 1-on-1 reps in Tuesday's practice, according to Andrew Callahan of the Boston Herald.\n\nThe Pats defensive front is taking a serious hit this summer, with Barmore out indefinitely and Matthew Judon off the reservation with his contract situation. So, it would be a fantastic development for White to emerge as a game-changer.\n\nWe credited Ximines with one sack and two total pressures in 11-on-11 on Tuesday, and he also held the edge well on one running play against the starting O-line. Entering his sixth NFL season, Ximines has an opportunity to carve out a role in his first year in New England.\n\nWade made one of the best secondary plays of the day, with a nice pass breakup in tight coverage on rookie wide receiver Javon Baker. Leaping on a well-placed corner fade to the end zone from Maye, Wade disrupted Baker at the catch point to prevent the finish.\n\nWade is embroiled in a real competition at cornerback behind Christian Gonzalez, and took a good step forward on Tuesday.\n\nDespite giving up the touchdown to Henry, Bledsoe also made multiple pass breakups, one against Austin Hooper in 11-on-11 and another in 1-on-1. The Patriots still need to figure out their best option to cover tight ends, and Bledsoe is getting a good, long look at that. The Henry \"touchdown\" was a perfect throw in tight coverage.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [],

Polk also shredded opposing cornerbacks during a competitive 1-on-1 period, recording three wins in four reps with the only other being a drop at the end of the period.\n\nPolk beat starting cornerback Marcus Jones on his first 1-on-1 rep, an out-breaking route from Drake Maye. He then cooked rookie cornerback Marcellas Dial Jr. on an-breaking route from Bailey Zappe. Polk also recorded a catch from Jacoby Brissett during the period with his drop coming on a ball from Joe Milton III.\n\nPolk followed up his 1-on-1 period with a pair of touchdown catches during red zone 7-on-7s and 11-on-11s. His most notable reception of the day came from Brissett, who threw a perfect ball to the corner of the end zone and Polk out-leaped Wilson in coverage. Polk's second touchdown came from Milton on a quick out-breaking route at the goal line.\n\nPolk had another catch from Maye during an 11-on-11 period, rebounding after the two rookies were unable to connect on the snap prior -- a high throw from Maye on a rollout. The completion came on a shallow crosser in the red area as Polk had a pair of defenders separating himself from the goal line.\n\nWhile it's been a struggle for the offensive to find consistency during two padded practices, the contributions from Polk have been a cause for optimism.\n\nHere are more observations from Day 6:\n\n-- Matthew Judon was not present. He reportedly was not even at the facility.\n\nJudon did not take part in New England's first padded practice Monday. He created headlines after his on-field discussion with head coach Jerod Mayo and animated conversation with executive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf. Judon, who feels he's deserving of more than his current contract is set to pay him, seems to be holding out.\n\n-- Drake Maye had another below average day. Maye wasn't helped out by the offensive line grouping in front of him, however, specifically backup center Antonio Mafi.\n\nMaye went 5-for-11 in 11-on-11 periods, including a troubling 1-for-6 during the second full-team session. It was a brutal stretch for that Maye-led group as Mafi started it with two low snaps, one which messed up a timing route from Maye to tight end Mitchell Wilcox. After those two low snaps, a Kevin Harris went for what would have been a scoop-and-score by Marco Wilson.\n\nMaye's unit also was forced to re-huddle during a prior red zone 11-on-11 period.\n\nHe played behind an offensive line consisting of, from left to right, Calvin Anderson, Michael Jordan, Mafi, Layden Robinson and Vederian Lowe.\n\n-- Jacoby Brissett, who seemed to distance himself from Maye during the first padded practice, was an identical 8-for-15 during competitive periods while being hindered by a drop. The Brissett-led offensive also had to run a lap after a pre-snap miscue during a full field 11-on-11 period.\n\nBrissett had some accuracy issues during an initial 7-on-7 red zone period with misfires to Tyquan Thornton and K.J. Osborn. He did, however, connect with tight end Hunter Henry on a diving touchdown reception on the first snap of red zone 11-on-11s.\n\n-- The starting offensive line stayed the same as Monday. Nick Leverett filled in for David Andrews, who was not seen, at center. The line consisted of, from left to right, Caedan Wallace, Sidy Sow, Leverett, Michael Onwenu and Chukwuma Okorafor.\n\nIt was a better day for that group.\n\n-- JuJu Smith-Schuster, who underwhelmed during the first five days, was more noticeable. The veteran wideout beat Alex Austin and Jonathan Jones during 1-on-1 reps and also drew what would have been a pass interference on Marcellas Dial Jr. on his final 1-on-1 rep.\n\nSmith-Schuster did have a brutal drop on a throw from Brissett during the initial 11-on-11 period, but caught a touchdown from Joe Milton III on an in-breaking route during red area 11-on-11s.\n\n-- Tyquan Thornton had a strong practice for a second consecutive day, too. It was good to see from the speedster who has underwhelmed when the pads come on in the past. Thornton won three 1-on-1 battles with catches from Brissett (against Isaiah Bolden), Bailey Zappe (against Azizi Hearn) and Milton (against Marco Wilson).\n\n-- The Patriots have an off day Wednesday before they return for Day 7 of training camp Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_t_mcguire@nesn.com", "name": "Sean T.

Along with Wahlberg giving a message to Maye, Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams is seen getting words of support from actor Ashton Kutcher, and Washington Commanders signal caller Jayden Daniels gets a friendly message from Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant.\n\nMaye is the quarterback of the future in New England indeed, but what about now? That's the big question in Foxboro, as New England brought in veteran signal caller Jacoby Brissett in free agency. A scenario does exist where Brissett gets the keys to the offense to start the season before Maye eventually takes over.\n\nMaye began spring practices working behind Brissett and Bailey Zappe but had passed Zappe on the depth chart by the end of the offseason program. With training camp underway, head coach Jerod Mayo declared Brissett the starting quarterback for now, but left the door open for Maye depending on how he performs.\n\n\"Look, if Drake -- and this goes to any position -- if he comes out here and he lights it up. Once again, it goes back to quality of reps. It could absolutely happen. Like, I sit here and tell you coming out of the spring, Jacoby looks like the starting quarterback.

Who saw their roster standing take a hit?\n\nWe had our eyes peeled throughout practice, and a number of guys stood out -- both positively and negatively. Let's take a look at the biggest studs and duds of the day:\n\nWR Javon Baker\n\nBaker hasn't been perfect during his first few practices, but he has proven his \"popcorn\" comment from the night he was drafted to be true -- making a pair of spectacular catches on back-to-back days.\n\nHe caught two passes, one from Jacoby Brissett and one from Drake Maye, during competitive team drills. He didn't fumble this time, either.\n\nQB Jacoby Brissett\n\nBrissett was fairly consistent, and even showed off some athleticism Monday. Brissett obviously made the throw on Baker's highlight-reel catch, but also had impressive completions to Tyquan Thornton and Ja'Lynn Polk -- the latter of which was made on the run after evading pressure.\n\nDT Davon Godchaux\n\nIs there any prettier sight for Godchaux than having Drew Rosenhaus actually show up to practice and talk to Jerod Mayo and Matt Groh? Yes, it's being able to be part of the conversation with Rosenhaus and Mayo after practice wraps up.\n\nGodchaux's contract problems appear to be headed to a conclusion, whether that means an extension or a trade, we don't know. Godchaux likely enjoys knowing conversations are being had, though.\n\nLB Matthew Judon\n\nLet's stick with the guys upset about their contracts.\n\nJudon did not participate in practice Monday, showing up in street clothes and sitting off to the side before having a lengthy conversation with Mayo. How did that conversation go? Judon plopped down from the stack of pads he was sitting on, moseyed around for a few minutes, then departed practice altogether.\n\nNot good.\n\nOT Chukwuma Okorafor\n\nOkorafor didn't have the worst day, holding down the right side in what might have been the top offensive line grouping's best overall showing. He did, however, have to take multiple laps for false start penalties, while kickstarting a short tussle with Joshua Uche.\n\nBill Belichick would place him here if he were writing this story, so we will, too.\n\nTE Mitchell Wilcox\n\nWilcox has struggled with drops through the first week of camp, adding two more Monday. Drake Maye as targeted him relatively often, but that won't continue if he keeps letting the ball hit the ground. The Patriots need reliability for the rookie, not drops.\n\nBONUS: LB Joshua Uche\n\nUche got tossed for his skirmish with Okorafor.

And while many have pegged Brissett as the \"perfect\" person to help mentor Maye as he develops into an NFL-caliber quarterback, Brissett just wants to be a teammate to him.\n\n\"I'm so far from perfect. Obviously, I appreciate the compliment, but I'm a teammate first. I'm going out there trying to be a good teammate first,\" Brissett said during his appearance on the \"Up & Adams\" show from Gillette Stadium on Monday. \"You don't have to pay me to be a good teammate. That just comes with who I am as a person. ... It's just what comes with you trying to help build the culture of being a good team. That's something I take pride in and that's just how I live my life. I don't want somebody to say the opposite of being perfect.\"\n\nWhile Brissett hasn't started a game since 2022, he is expected to be New England's QB1. He made three appearances last season for the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nDespite not starting since 2022, Brissett is confident in what he brings to the table. He's not worried about losing his role on the team because he wants Maye to be prepared to come in should he need to. He likened it to his first stint in New England when he backed up Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\n\"I just personally think -- and this is not in a cocky way -- that I'm very confident in my skills and what I bring to the table as a player that it takes nothing away from me being a good person and just helping somebody,\" Brissett said. \"It doesn't cost anything to be a good teammate. Because if something happens to me, I want the next person to come in and I don't want the standard to change.\n\n\"That was the same thing when Tom was here, when Jimmy was here. We all competed against each other, but we also helped each other,\" he continued. \"We wanted our (quarterback) room to be the best room in the league. That's the ultimate goal. I want all of us to play for 40 years, 50 years, however long we want to play. And if I can be a sprinkle in somebody's career, helping them out, I think that's a success.\"\n\nThe quarterback room isn't perfect, but it's trending in a good direction after an ugly 4-13 season in 2023 that was highlighted by a slew of struggles from Mac Jones.

The Patriots had a normal, drama-free day, which they needed in the worst way.\n\nMatthew Judon was nowhere to be seen following his on-field outburst Monday. Davon Godchaux, also protesting his contract by not wearing pads at practice, participated in some drills and didn't make a scene.\n\nThe offensive performance wasn't great, but it was cleaner. The Patriots made it 1:40 into practice before committing a mistake. There were no fights, either.\n\nInterestingly, de facto general manager Eliot Wolf was absent, perhaps spending the time figuring out what to do with Godchaux and Judon.\n\nThe Patriots put in a solid day, perhaps creating some momentum heading into Wednesday's off day. They need to start stacking good days together.\n\n2. Drake Maye continues to underwhelm while Joe Milton impresses. I wrote after last Thursday's practice that Milton is the \"wow\" quarterback at camp -- the guy with the best size, best athleticism, and biggest arm. Now I'll take it a step further: Milton outplayed Maye over the first six practices of camp. You can't tell which player is the No. 3 overall pick (Maye) and which is the sixth-round flier (Milton).\n\nMaye is running second on the depth chart and getting a ton of work, but he hasn't made many noteworthy throws. He was the only quarterback not to throw a touchdown pass in a red zone drill Tuesday, while Milton, in limited reps, threw touchdowns on consecutive plays, one on a drag to Polk and another on an RPO slant to JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nIn the red zone/two-minute situation, Maye had an ugly, off-platform throw that went way wide of Smith-Schuster, a hospital ball to tight end Mitchell Wilcox that got him sandwiched between two defenders, and an incomplete corner fade to Javon Baker in the end zone that had the entire offense doing pushups.\n\nMeanwhile, Milton wows the crowd every day with his tantalizing arm and standing backflips. After Maye struggled in the red zone, Milton promptly came in and completed a nice pass to Kawaan Baker on the sideline.\n\n3. Is left tackle getting settled? Back on July 24, I asked, \"Is the left tackle experiment already over for Caedan Wallace?\" What I meant to write was, \"Is Caedan Wallace about to settle in to the left tackle spot?\"\n\nBecause after playing on the right side the first two days of camp, Wallace has played only left tackle with the starting offense the last four days. It's hard to tell if Wallace is holding his own, but the Patriots would prove a lot of naysayers wrong if Wallace, who played only right tackle at Penn State, can develop into a starting left tackle.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Judon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Judon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davon_Godchaux", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davon Godchaux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eliot Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red zone (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Wilcox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JuJu_Smith-Schuster", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JuJu Smith-Schuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penn State Nittany Lions football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/SuGm107CqMUZWf-CYnnn-RtQZaQ=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/WWSNY3CTFRIGZOL23UEPDBSM4Y.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 2138, "textEnd": 2145}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Projected starting quarterback Jacoby Brissett had an animated reaction to the pre-snap miscue.

Tackle Chukwuma Okorafor, rookie guard Layden Robinson, and running back Rhamondre Stevenson have all had to run laps for committing false starts, going back to Sunday. But the full-group punishments are the most draining.\n\n\"It's just accountability, just doing the right thing every play, even when we're tired,\" Stevenson said after practice Tuesday. \"When we fail to do that, there's consequences.\"\n\nIn a trait passed down to Mayo from his predecessor, Bill Belichick, laps have been the head coach's way of telling the offense that simple pre-snap mistakes are unacceptable. And it's been one of Mayo's methods of dispelling the notion that he's a \"player's coach,\" a label with often-negative connotations.\n\n\"Look, they can say whatever they want to say,\" Mayo said during an interview with Kay Adams for FanDuel TV. \"For me, it's about accountability, it's about these guys being professionals. It's not about setting a bunch of rules ... you're a professional, take ownership of your career, and let's go out here and ball out, and if you as an individual play well, then your respective side of the ball is going to play well, and that leads to the team playing well. I challenge the guys with that.\"\n\nThe pre-snap problems with the Patriots offense are particularly frustrating in 2024, because they've been an issue since at least 2022, when Matt Patricia coordinated the unit and coached the O-line. The line, quarterbacks, running backs, receivers, and tight ends are almost entirely new, as are the offensive coaches. But similar issues remain.\n\nIt's only six days of open practices training camp, with seven more to go, and there's still the entire preseason to come. So, the Patriots have plenty of time to iron out their pre-snap woes. But it's clear at this point what's going to happen at practice if they can't.\n\n\"We just kept jumping offsides,\" tight end Austin Hooper said Monday. \"We aren't figuring it out by just talking to each other. Let's run until we figure it out. So, we'll be a cross-country team, or we'll be a football team. I'd rather be a football team.\"\n\nSilver lining: when the Patriots' starting offense has lined up properly and snapped the ball, they've looked at times like a representative NFL unit, capable of making plays down the field - a rare sight from the offense of the past two seasons. Brissett has been easily the best QB on the field, and Maye's development, while a bigger long-term concern, is becoming a side piece to the story of 2024, as Brissett tightens his grip on the starting job.\n\nBrissett and tight end Hunter Henry connected for the best play of the day during a red zone 11-on-11 period, as the quarterback threaded the needle to Henry in the end zone over safety Joshuah Bledsoe for a \"touchdown.\" That play pumped up the rest of the offense watching from the sidelines. It certainly beat running another lap.\n\nAs for the line, Brissett mostly had a clean pocket, with two total pressures charted on 11 dropbacks. It's the pass-catchers that let the unit down post-snap. Brissett finished 5-of-10 passing, but two were dropped - wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster had the most egregious drop of the day, bobbling it off his hands after getting wide open on an out route - and another was a catchable ball for Hooper that Bledsoe broke up.\n\nMaye and the backups aren't off the hook, in fact it's worse. Maye finished 4-of-10 in 11-on-11, while facing three total pressures and dealing with erratic snapping by center Atonio Mafi. Maye's four completions were all in the short area of the field. Oh, and he and running back Kevin Harris botched a handoff, as Harris appeared to straight-up drop the ball behind the line. Cornerback Marco Wilson scooped it up and ran it back.\n\nThe third overall pick in the 2024 draft has looked unsure of himself at times, hesitating and pump-faking in lieu of going for a play down the field. The mere fact he's repping exclusively with the 2's is a sign that he's a long way from learning the Patriots offense and how to \"play the position\" at the NFL level.\n\nMORE: 11 players that stood out on day 6 of Patriots training camp\n\nBut ultimately, it's pre-snap where the Patriots offense has had the biggest problems. Mayo agrees, based on when he's made the guys take laps. It remains to be seen whether that disciplinary style will lead to progress.\n\nBecause after three straight days of cross-country, we're still waiting for 100% football.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamondre_Stevenson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhamondre Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Patricia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Patricia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Hooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Hooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonio_Mafi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atonio Mafi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harris_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harris (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshuah_Bledsoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshuah Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JuJu_Smith-Schuster", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JuJu Smith-Schuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red zone (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_country_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross country running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/07/Jacoby-Brissett-dropback-2024-Patriots-training-camp-social_1722384773_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773478", "eventUri": "eng-9773478", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Even though he has yet to take an NFL snap, Patriots fans are excited to see what the gunslinger will do in 2024.\n\nOne of those excited Patriots fans is none other than the 2024 third-overall pick's girlfriend, Ann Michael Hudson, who is obviously in attendance at the Patriots training camp with her NFL rookie boyfriend.\n\nIt's possible that Hudson is the most excited about Maye and unafraid to show her support for the former North Carolina passer.

Because if something happens to me, I want the next person to come in and I don't want the standard to change.\n\n\"That was the same thing when Tom (Brady) was here, when Jimmy (Garoppolo) was here. We all competed against each other, but we also helped each other. We wanted our (quarterback) room to be the best room in the league. That's the ultimate goal. I want all of us to play for 40 years, 50 years, however long we want to play. And if I can be a sprinkle in somebody's career, helping them out, I think that's a success.\"\n\nThe Patriots drafted Brissett in the third round in 2016. He appeared in three games (two starts) with New England -- Tom Brady was suspended that year -- before being traded to the Indianapolis Colts in September 2017, kickstarting a journey that has seen Brissett suit up for the Miami Dolphins, Cleveland Browns and Washington Commanders, as well.\n\nNow, Brissett is back in Foxboro, signing a one-year contract with the Patriots this offseason. And he is the established veteran this time around, with Maye looking to prove himself as the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nWhile discussing the quarterback dynamic in New England, Kay Adams asked Brissett whether Brady always helped him during his first Patriots tenure. And the 31-year-old made a funny admission that speaks to the competitiveness within that 2016 QB room, which also featured 2014 second-round pick Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\n\"Oh, hell no,\" Brissett said, seemingly joking. \"No, I'm sorry. He didn't always; it was always a competition, for sure.\"\n\n\"I think that's what it all boils down to,\" he then added of the respect that existed between him and Brady as teammates, \"because at the end of the day, we all have the same jersey on, same helmet on. Regardless of who they put out there, who's going to be the starter is going to be the starter. At the end of the day, it's like I said, we want our group and our room to be the best in the league.\"\n\nThe Patriots have a long way to go before they can say they have an elite quarterback room, let alone the NFL's best.

Paul Perillo\n\nJust before training camp began, Jerod Mayo explained how the practice schedule would fluctuate at times in terms of the length of each workout. Some might be cut short if the players appeared fatigued while others might run a bit longer if more intensity was needed.\n\nTuesday appeared to be a day in which Mayo felt more work was necessary. Perhaps that was due to an uncommonly sloppy day on Monday when the offense committed numerous false start penalties and was forced to run a lap just before the conclusion of the final team period.\n\nTight end Austin Hooper called it unacceptable, and it's possible that Mayo agreed. But for whatever the reason, the Patriots spent more time on the field on Tuesday than on any previous day, working for just under two hours and 15 minutes.\n\nOf course, it's also possible the longer practice was simply part of the normal schedule. Either way, while there seemed to be some signs of improvement offensively, the overall performance remained uneven - and the lack of discipline and pre-snap issues persisted.\n\nAgain the offense was sent on a lap, this time for an apparent substitution issue as it appeared as if there were too many men in the huddle prior to a play late in Jacoby Brissett's final series of work. Brissett returned with one of his better throws of the day, layering a nice ball between two defenders to K.J. Osborn, who made the catch near the left sideline.\n\nInterestingly, when Brissett next took the field following some extended work for Drake Maye, the offense goal was to execute a play before finishing with a field goal attempt. Brissett came to the line and barked out the cadence for longer than normal, using a hard count three times in an effort to draw the defense offside. Considering the problems with pre-snap penalties for the offense, it was a positive sign to see the group hold its water and remain in position with no issues.\n\nThe offense had more success on Tuesday than it enjoyed a day earlier, although it was far from perfect. The running game received some attention and Rhamondre Stevenson is encouraged by the early results. He explained his mindset of trying to find one cut before working his way downhill, which is a style that he hasn't necessarily featured thus far in his career.\n\nMayo has explained how the defense is generally ahead of the offense at this time of year, but Stevenson wasn't necessarily buying that theory.\n\n\"I don't agree with that,\" he said. \"I think it should be back and forth with the offense enjoying some success and the defense having its days as well. I feel like we've been pretty competitive thus far. Now it's about stringing days together and eliminating the penalties.\"\n\nSome of the moments for the offense included connections from Brissett to Ja'Lynn Polk for a touchdown in 7-on-7s and a Drake Maye-to-DeMario Douglas out for another solid gain. Rookie Joe Milton found his best rhythm of camp thus far, hitting JuJu Smith-Schuster on a beautiful slant for a touchdown. All of those plays came from within the red zone, marking the first work the offense has done in that area thus far this summer.\n\nBeyond the uneven offense, here are one man's observations from Day 6 of training camp.\n\n*Matthew Judon did not make an appearance on Tuesday. After entering the field without pads on Monday and having extended separate talks with Mayo as well as Eliot Wolf and Matt Groh before leaving, the pass rusher was not seen.\n\n*No changes to the PUP list as Kendrick Bourne (knee), Cole Strange (knee), Sione Takitaki and Jake Andrews all remained sidelined. No update on Christian Barmore's (blood clots) situation and he continues to be sidelined. David Andrews missed his second straight practice and was replaced again by Nick Leverett at center. Marte Mapu continues to arrive about 30 minutes into practice and has yet to participate. He stands deep in the secondary near the sideline during 11-on-11s and relays hand-signals to the secondary as he mentally prepares on his own. Jabrill Peppers missed practice and was seen wearing a sleeve on his left leg. He appeared to be dealing with an injury before leaving Monday's practice and was unable to go. Also, rookie Jaheim Bell missed his second straight practice.\n\n*Douglas and Shaun Wade both wore red, non-contact jerseys but took part in some competitive drills. Douglas saw his first reps in 7-on-7s while Wade was active in the secondary in both 7s and full team work. He came up with a nice pass defensed on an end zone fade from Maye intended for Javon Baker, leaping to knock the ball down before the rookie could make the grab.\n\n*It's interesting to watch the bevy of receivers working each day with all four quarterbacks. Unlike in some past camps, the current group does not have clear-cut options and that has resulted in a variety of players flashing each day. Polk was active on Tuesday while fellow rookie Baker was less effective than he has been thus far. Smith-Schuster had enjoyed one of his better days, although he did have a bad drop near the left sideline on a perfect throw from Brissett. Otherwise he consistently got open and made some plays. Osborn also was effective against coverage, breaking free on a slant for what should have been a touchdown in 7-on-7s, only to have Brissett overthrow him. The group is still searching for consistency but pretty much everyone involved has received plenty of targets from all of the quarterbacks.\n\n*Marco Wilson had an active day on Tuesday, with some good and some bad. First he was beaten by Polk for the touchdown in 7-on-7s, but he responded quite well. He was in the right place at the right time when he scooped up a fumbled exchange between Maye and Kevin Harris before racing for the scoop-and-score. On the next play, Wilson had excellent coverage on Baker on an out-route, knocking Maye's pass down for the incompletion. Wilson spent nearly three full seasons in Arizona before finishing the 2023 season with the Patriots for the final game. He's likely vying for a backup cornerback spot along with Alex Austin, Shaun Wade and Isaiah Bolden among others.\n\n*The secondary featured some different looks on Tuesday with Jonathan Jones lining up at deep safety at times in a group with Marcus Jones, Kyle Dugger, Christian Gonzalez and Jaylinn Hawkins. I wonder if Mayo looks at the defensive backfield the way he described the offensive line earlier in camp when he said he was searching for the best five players. It's possible that with Gonzalez and the two Joneses along with Dugger and Peppers that Mayo feels that's the best combination and Jonathan Jones' versatility to play inside, outside and deep might allow him to use that option. Something I'll be keeping an eye on going forward.\n\n*Both Chad Ryland and Joey Slye connected on field goals from about 42 yards out following single offensive plays designed to lead to the kicks to close practice.\n\n*Rather than sprints on the hills, the players ran in three position groups across the field at the end of the workout.\n\n*In addition to Stevenson, Marcus Jones, Smith-Schuster and Mike Onwenu were among those who spoke to the media after practice.\n\n*The Patriots will enjoy their second day off of camp on Wednesday before returning to Foxborough on Thursday. Thursday's practice is set to start at 11 a.m. and is once again open to the public with gates set to open at 10 a.m.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views and thoughts expressed in this article are those of the writer and don't necessarily reflect those of the organization.

Let's just say that Wednesday's \"day off\" comes at a good time from the No. 3 overall pick out of North Carolina.\n\nJourneyman Jacoby Brissett -- 18-30 as an NFL starter over eight pro seasons -- has zoomed to the front of this QB group over the last couple practices, building a substantial lead over the pack.\n\nThe most troubling, if you're a Maye guy, and promising, if you are a Patriots fan, news on Tuesday morning was another solid, stacked day from sixth-round draft pick Joe Milton. His throwing motion is smooth, he's a huge presence in the pocket and can move ... at least as it seems here in late July.\n\nWe are light years from the regular season, so take Maye's perceived struggles for what it's worth. But his early camp woes, combined with some startling video recently, is a bit striking where the Patriots are concerned.\n\nIt gets you thinking, what if? As in, what if the talent-deprived Patriots piled up picks back in April instead of putting so much on Maye's broad shoulders?\n\nWatching New York Giants general manager Joe Schoen basically beg Ron Wolf's son, Patriots Vice President of Player Personnel Eliot Wolf, for the No. 3 pick in last April's NFL Draft both stung and perplexed -- all in 45 seconds on the latest episode (No. 4) of HBO's \"Hard Knocks: Offseason with the New York Giants.\"\n\nWhat the heck was Wolf thinking about when New York offered the No. 6 pick overall, the Giants' 2025 first-rounder and, as Schoen said, \"something more this year,\" for the No. 3 overall pick?\n\nSchoen was, in his words, \"trying to make it attractive.\"\n\nTwo ones and maybe a third rounder? Sign me up. But not Wolf and the Patriots, who chose not to even listen.\n\nOf course, we know why.\n\nIn fact, back before the draft it was explained in this column why the Patriots were not moving, why they would not even consider trading back, why they wouldn't entertain the idea of Marvin Harrison Jr. or a left tackle at No. 3, and why they were locked in on Drake Maye or Jayden Daniels, whomever the Commanders passed on at No. 2.\n\nPublic. Relations.\n\nThe assertion that, to keep its fan base engaged, the Patriots would have to select a quarterback at No. 3 was galvanized by Wolf himself.\n\nWhen Schoen, whose club was off-the-charts enthused about Maye, inquired, Wolf might as well have been holding his hands over his ears while screaming, \"La, la, la, la, la, la.\"\n\nHe wasn't even listening -- likely because he was not allowed to.\n\nThe Patriots were picking a QB at No. 3. They weren't moving back to take the leftovers like they did with Mac Jones in 2021.\n\nWe saw how that worked out.\n\nBut man, that Giants offer was fat -- for three spots. A roster that is severely depleted at the key positions -- receiver and offensive line, to name two -- could use the boost. Instead, Wolf steadfastly stuck to Maye, whom if the past decade proves anything, basically has a one in three chance to be a franchise guy.\n\nAnd judging by his current training camp start, it's just not happening anytime too soon.\n\nFollow Hector Longo on \"X,\" the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: @mvcreature", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news",

The longest session of the summer saw the team continue to feature 1-on-1 work and move into the red area for the first time this training camp.\n\nHere's what went down at Gillette Stadium.\n\nAbsent: LB Matthew Judon, C David Andrews, DL Christian Barmore, WR Kendrick Bourne (PUP), G Cole Strange (PUP), OL Jake Andrews (PUP), LB Sione Takitaki (PUP)\n\nAfter an eventful day of Monday, Matthew Judon was not present at Patriots practice on Tuesday as he continues his ongoing contract dispute.\n\nDeMario Douglas has not participated in team drills through the summer, but that changed on Tuesday as he wore a red non-contact jersey and returned to team work. Jaheim Bell and Jabrill Peppers did not participate, but were seen, after spending time with the trainers on Monday. Marte Mapu also remained a non-participant.\n\nBrissett's unit: The veteran quarterback entered Tuesday's session coming off a pair of steady practices, but Brissett struggled with accuracy at times. That included a pass behind Hunter Henry allowing Joshuah Bledsoe to break it up and two misses intended for Jalen Reagor. Brissett did, however, have the best ball of the day hitting Henry with a perfect pass on an over route for a score.\n\nAs for the Brissett-led offense, it was not as clean as a performance as Monday's practice. Beyond having to run another team lap for a substitution error, the run game struggled and receivers often wore coverage. In a positive note, the starting offensive line mainly held up again -- helping lead to a nice completion to K.J. Osborn on a crosser.\n\nMaye's day: After a down two days for the rookie, Drake Maye rebounded nicely to start Tuesday's session: he was sharp in 1-on-1s -- specifically when throwing outside the numbers. When the work transitioned to team drills, Maye then completed his first five throws while operating mainly in the short area of the field; one big play came on a play-action bootleg to Mitchell Wilcox.\n\nThings weren't as smooth during his final three drives of 11-on-11 work (his busiest practice so far). The backup offensive line he was operating with was not as productive, and the ball often found the ground. Maye had his worst miss of the day go toward K.J. Osborn, saw a ball go through Wilcox's hands, and had a pair of incompletions to Javon Baker -- one due to quick pressure, and one broken up by Marco Wilson.\n\nHe did respond with a nice crosser to Ja'Lynn Polk and a short attempt to Jacob Warren, while a jump ball to Baker hit the turf. Things continue to seem to be moving fast out there for the rookie in his first two padded practices, opening the gap between him and Brissett. No need to hit the panic button at this point, however -- as one of his teammates echoed.\n\n\"Whenever he does get more opportunities, he's going to show you guys how great he really is and why he went where he went,\" Jalen Reagor said after practice.\n\nWhite's presence: The second-year defensive lineman continued his strong offseason on Tuesday. Beyond a pair of strong reps in 1-on-1s, White was causing havoc during team periods. In addition to blowing up a run play, he also had a quick win over Layden Robinson to cause immediate pressure and an incompletion.\n\nRookie wideouts: Another good day for rookie wide receivers Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker. Polk continues to be extremely consistent and did his best work in team drills in the red area. He hauled in a jump ball from Brissett over Marco Wilson and later connected with Joe Milton on a strong out route for another score. Polk also tallied a pair of wins in 1-on-1s against Marcus Jones and Marcellas Dial.\n\nAs for Baker, there was no highlight play for the receiver today but he continued to get open throughout the day. That included beating Isaiah Bolden downfield in a 1-on-1 even though the ball was slightly underthrown resulting in an incompletion.\n\nOther notes:\n\nNew England will be off on Wednesday following three straight sessions.

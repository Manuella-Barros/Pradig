The 2024 season was a difficult one for the franchise, as they finished fifth out of six teams, registering just three wins in 10 group stage matches.\n\nPretoria Capitals are owned by the JSW Group, which also owns Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League. DC parted ways with head coach Ricky Ponting earlier this month, and are yet to announce a replacement. It is not out of the question that Trott could be a candidate for that job, perhaps in the future. DC had also signed one of Trott's charges at Afghanistan, Gulbadin Naib, as a replacement player in IPL 2024.\n\nThe former England batter is also one of the candidates listed by bookmakers to take over from Matthew Mott as England men's white-ball head coach, although he is not seriously thought to be in the running as Andrew Flintoff appears to be the favourite there.\n\nTrott had taken over leadership of the Afghanistan men's national team in July 2022. During his tenure, they participated in three World Cups -- the T20 editions in 2022 and 2024, and the ODI edition in 2023.\n\nThe most recent one of those tournament saw Afghanistan achieve a fairytale run to the semifinals, taking down Australia and Bangladesh along the way. They were thumped by South Africa at that stage, but drew accolades for their performance throughout the tournament.\n\nIn the ODI World Cup in 2023, Afghanistan managed memorable victories over Pakistan, England and Sri Lanka. They had eventual champions Australia on the ropes at 91-7 in defense of 292, and narrowly missed out on a semifinal berth thanks to a Glenn Maxwell double century.\n\nThere has not been official confirmation as yet of Trott's departure from the head coaching role with Afghanistan. He had signed a contract extension earlier this year to remain with the team until the end of the calendar year. Given that the next season of SA20 is only in 2025, Trott may complete his term with Afghanistan before taking over at Pretoria.", "source": {"uri": "wisden.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

His contract, renewed in January, is set to run through the end of 2024.\n\nAlso Read | India at Olympics 2024 Schedule Today: Check Full List of Indian Athletes in Action on July 30 in Paris With Time in IST.\n\nHowever, it is uncertain if the 43-year-old will remain in this position beyond that period. The SA20 league will take place in January 2025, which does not conflict with his current international duties. Despite this, there has been no confirmation regarding whether Trott will extend his contract with Afghanistan, which is due to expire in December.\n\nThe Capitals are undergoing significant changes after parting ways with Ricky Ponting, ending his seven-year tenure with the Delhi franchise. Pretoria's decision to release Graham Ford followed a challenging second season in which they secured only three victories and finished fifth. This was a stark contrast to their debut season in 2023, where they topped the table and finished as runners-up.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: China Claims Diving Record with Its 49th Olympic Gold Medal, Surpasses United States of America.\n\nJonathan Trott has enjoyed notable success as head coach of Afghanistan, significantly improving the team's performance in global tournaments.

Over the past nine months, they have defeated major teams such as Australia, England, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, and Bangladesh during the 2023 ODI and 2024 T20I World Cups, ultimately reaching the semi-finals of the latter before losing to South Africa.\n\nTrott is also being considered for England's limited-overs head coach position, although he is seen as an outside contender. A decision on the future of the current head coach, Matthew Mott, is expected soon. Trott, who earned 127 caps for England, has previously coached the Under-19 and Lions teams and is currently serving as assistant coach of the Trent Rockets in the men's Hundred.

Trott replaces Graham Ford, who left the role at the franchise earlier this month.\n\nUnder Ford, the Capitals became runners-up in season one of SA20, but had a difficult time and finished in fifth place in the second season of the tournament. This is the second major shake-up in the Capitals' franchise world after Ricky Ponting parted ways with Delhi Capitals (DC) in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nTrott comes into the role ahead of Season 3 of SA20 on the back of delivering spectacular results with a much-improved Afghanistan in two consecutive World Cups.\n\nIn the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup, Afghanistan beat teams like New Zealand, Bangladesh and Australia to enter the semifinals for the first time, before losing to South Africa in Trinidad, making this their best-ever performance in the global trophy of the shortest format.\n\nIn the 2023 Men's ODI World Cup, Afghanistan beat England, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the Netherlands in an impressive campaign in India.

He has done a great job as coach of the Afghanistan National Cricket Team and the franchise would be hoping that he replicates something similar for them in the upcoming edition.\n\nThe SA20 2025 is scheduled to take place from January 9 to February 8. The deadline for retaining players has passed, and the teams are expected to announce the squads soon. The auction for the tournament is all set to take place in September to fill the remaining spots following retention and overseas signings, which can be announced by August 31.\n\nComing to the Pretoria Capitals, they would be keen to build the squad that can help them win the title. They had a tough season in the last edition, and with the addition of Jonathan Trott this year, they would be hoping that their fortunes change.\n\nTaking to their Twitter account, Pretoria Capitals announced the appointment of Jonathan Trott. They stated: \"Pretoria, give us a warm cheer as we welcome Jonathan Trott as the Head Coach for the upcoming #SA20 season\"\n\nJonathan Trott has been credited a lot for the development of the Afghanistan National Cricket Team. He has worked a lot with the team and has ensured that they match with the top teams in the world. In the ICC World Cup 2023, they beat Pakistan and England and even were close to defeating Australia.\n\nUnder Jonathan Trott, Afghanistan brought out their best in the T20 World Cup 2024. They defeated big teams in New Zealand and Australia and reached the semi-final of the tournament before losing to the South Africa National Cricket Team in the semi-final of the event.\n\nPretoria Capitals started the SA20 on high as they displayed an impressive performance in the inaugural edition. They won 7 out of their 10 matches in the league stage and ended at the No.1 spot in the points table with 32 points.\n\nIn the playoffs too, they were sensational as they defeated Paarl Royals by 29 runs in the semi-final to reach the final. However, in the summit clash, they succumbed to pressure as they lost to Sunrisers Eastern Cape by 4 wickets.\n\nIn the last edition, Pretoria Capitals were decent with the bat and ball but they failed to qualify. They were in the race for playoffs; however, in the end, Durban's Super Giants lost to Joburg Super Kings, which meant curtains for the team in the tournament.

His contract, renewed in January, is set to run through the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, it is uncertain if the 43-year-old will remain in this position beyond that period. The SA20 league will take place in January 2025, which does not conflict with his current international duties. Despite this, there has been no confirmation regarding whether Trott will extend his contract with Afghanistan, which is due to expire in December.\n\nThe Capitals are undergoing significant changes after parting ways with Ricky Ponting, ending his seven-year tenure with the Delhi franchise. Pretoria's decision to release Graham Ford followed a challenging second season in which they secured only three victories and finished fifth. This was a stark contrast to their debut season in 2023, where they topped the table and finished as runners-up.\n\nJonathan Trott has enjoyed notable success as head coach of Afghanistan, significantly improving the team's performance in global tournaments. Despite their talent in shorter formats, Afghanistan had only won a single match in ICC tournaments before Trott's tenure. Over the past nine months, they have defeated major teams such as Australia, England, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, and Bangladesh during the 2023 ODI and 2024 T20I World Cups, ultimately reaching the semi-finals of the latter before losing to South Africa.\n\nTrott is also being considered for England's limited-overs head coach position, although he is seen as an outside contender. A decision on the future of the current head coach, Matthew Mott, is expected soon. Trott, who earned 127 caps for England, has previously coached the Under-19 and Lions teams and is currently serving as assistant coach of the Trent Rockets in the men's Hundred.

The SA20 coaching stint with the Capitals also marks Trott's return to South Africa, the country of his birth.\n\nHe attended the prestigious Rondebosch Boys' High School in Cape Town and represented South Africa at U-15 and U-19 levels, as well as played for Western Province and Boland before pursuing an international playing career for England (52 Tests, 68 ODIs and 7 T2OIs) and being associated with Warwickshire County Cricket Club in Birmingham.\n\nMeanwhile, two-time champion Sunrisers Eastern Cape have confirmed the Netherlands' all-rounder Roelof van der Merwe will come back to the side for SA20 Season 3 after being unavailable for the previous edition.\n\nIn the inaugural season, van der Merwe was the joint leading wicket-taker with 20 scalps, coming at an economy rate of just 5.62,

Crawley will link up with the two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape for the third season of the SA20.\n\nCrawley is the fourth England player among the direct signings before the August 31 deadline ahead of SA20 2025 after Joe Root (Paarl Royals), Chris Woakes (Durban's Super Giants) and Ben Stokes, who has been offered a sizeable contract by MI Cape Town. Crawley, who has branched out previously in the Big Bash League for the Hobart Hurricanes, will be playing in the SA20 for the first time.\n\nWith the aggressive game-play he has shown for England amid the Bazball approach and for Kent in the T20 Blast and the London Spirit in the Hundred, will make a good fit in the Sunrisers top-order, which features the likes of Jordan Hermann, Tom Abell, Aiden Markram and Tristan Stubbs. Crawley was the second direct signing for the Sunrisers ahead of the 2025 edition, alongside Roelof van der Merwe, who returns to the SA20 fold after missing the sophomore year.\n\nVan der Merwe was the joint-highest wicket-taker in the inaugural edition of the SA20 but made himself available for the ILT20 in 2024, which runs along the same January timeline. Brandon King and Kane Williamson are the other direct signings for the season thus far, both for the Durban's Super Giants.\n\nFormer England international and current Afghanistan head coach, Jonathan Trott has replaced Graham Ford as the head coach of the Pretoria Capitals franchise in SA20. Trott, who had his contract with the Afghanistan national side renewed in January this year, has been at the helm of the side since 2022. Afghanistan beat Pakistan, England and nearly Australia if not for Glenn Maxwell special last year in the ODI World Cup and under Trott, they qualified for the T20 World Cup semi-finals for the first time in an ICC event.\n\nTrott is currently part of the Trent Rockets' setup in the men's Hundred and will hope to resurrect the Capitals' outfit in the SA20 after a below-par season with uncertainty over his future with the Afghanistan side. Trott's contract with Afghanistan is set to end in December this year.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Incidentally, he has only featured in one List A game thus far for the England Lions against the touring South Africans (which includes his new teammate Anrich Nortje), in 2022.\n\nThe franchise had earlier roped in current Afghanistan head coach and former England batter Jonathan Trott as their new head coach ahead of SA20 Season 3 and replaces Graham Ford in the role.\n\nTrott comes into the role ahead of Season 3 of SA20 on the back of delivering spectacular results with a much-improved Afghanistan in two consecutive World Cups. In the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup, Afghanistan beat teams like New Zealand, Bangladesh and Australia to enter the semifinals for the first time, before losing to South Africa in Trinidad, making this their best-ever performance in the global trophy of the shortest format.\n\nUnder Ford, the Capitals finished runners-up in season one of SA20 but had a difficult time and finished in fifth place in the second season of the tournament.

(KARK) - Residents in Arkansas and Kansas have been put on high alert as authorities search for an Alabama man they say is wanted in connection with three homicides in Oklahoma.\n\nStacy Drake, 50, of Birmingham, was last seen on surveillance footage at a hotel in Morrilton, Arkansas, about 50 miles northwest of Little Rock, according to police. The Morrilton Police Department also said that Arkansas State Police had notified them that the vehicle used in the homicides was parked at the hotel.\n\nOfficials said that officers searched the hotel, but Drake was not found. Police said it is unknown how he left the hotel.\n\nDrake is a person of interest in three homicides from two different carjackings in Oklahoma.\n\nOne of those occurred on Tuesday, when authorities in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, were called to a double homicide in Gans, roughly 100 miles southeast of Tulsa. According to Nexstar's KFOR, a man and a woman were found dead inside a business \"with injuries consistent with homicide.\"\n\nThe Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation named Drake as a person of interest in the case, though they did not share why.

ASP said the LaFerry's killings were the result of a carjacking.\n\nPrior to the double homicide, Sheriff Lane said they believe Drake spent three days in the Maple, Akins, Hanson, and Central communities. Deputies are asking residents to reach out if they think they saw, spoke, or know about his whereabouts while he was in the area.\n\nThe truck he was believed to have been driving while in the area was found on East Redwood near the low water slab on Saturday, June 15.\n\nSCSO deputies will be in the area talking to residents and asking the community to check with their friends and neighbors.\n\nAccording to the Morrilton Police Department, the vehicle stolen during the LaFerry's killings was found 125 miles east in Morrilton, Ark., about a 2-hour drive on Interstate 40.\n\nThat stolen vehicle was found by officers in Morrilton at a local hotel Tuesday night, the Morrilton Police Department said in a Facebook post.\n\nMorrilton police did say Drake was believed to be armed with a handgun, \"and he is very dangerous.\" An emergency alert was sent out about Drake, calling him an \"armed man.\"\n\nMorrilton Police Chief Sonny Stover said they are checking surveillance footage in the area that could've caught Drake on camera.\n\nAuthorities believe Drake purchased camping gear prior to him being found. \"Arkansas State Police urges the public to exercise caution as Drake is believed to be armed and dangerous.

ASP said the LaFerry's killings were the result of a carjacking.\n\nPrior to the double homicide, Sheriff Lane said they believe Drake spent three days in the Maple, Akins, Hanson, and Central communities. Deputies are asking residents to reach out if they think they saw, spoke, or know about his whereabouts while he was in the area.\n\nThe truck he was believed to have been driving while in the area was found on East Redwood near the low water slab on Saturday, June 15.\n\nSCSO deputies will be in the area talking to residents and asking the community to check with their friends and neighbors.\n\nSheriff Lane said Tuesday evening there wasn't a further threat to area residents in Sequoyah County.\n\nAccording to the Morrilton Police Department, the vehicle stolen during the LaFerry's killings was found 125 miles east in Morrilton, Ark., about a 2-hour drive on Interstate 40.\n\nThat stolen vehicle was found by officers in Morrilton at a local hotel Tuesday night, the Morrilton Police Department said in a Facebook post.\n\nMorrilton police did say Drake is believed to be armed with a handgun, \"and he is very dangerous.\" An emergency alert was sent out about Drake, calling him an \"armed man.\"\n\nMorrilton Police Chief Sonny Stover said they are checking surveillance footage in the area that could've caught Drake on camera. He said Drake was last seen on foot Tuesday night at 7:30 while walking east on University Avenue.\n\n\"We will continue to saturate the area and check property to make sure he is not hiding somewhere and follow up on any tips that come in,\" Stover said.\n\nAuthorities believe Drake purchased camping gear and is still believed to be in the Morrilton area as of Wednesday at 5 p.m. \"Arkansas State Police urges the public to exercise caution as Drake is believed to be armed and dangerous.

Rusty attended Tuscaloosa High School and was a proud member of the class of 1980.\"\n\nKennedy said Thursday the investigation into the murder of Andrews led them to determine the suspect was transient.\n\n\"It was determined that the suspect was using a false name and had only been present in Tuscaloosa a few weeks,'' Kennedy said. \"After the murder, the victim's vehicle was stolen by the suspect.\"\n\nAndrews' vehicle was found on camera traveling along an interstate near the Arkansas-Oklahoma border area in the hours after the crime. To date, the victim's vehicle has not been located or recovered, Kennedy said.\n\nInvestigators used multiple resources in an attempt to identify the suspect. These included electronic, forensic, and eventually human eyewitnesses, Kennedy said.\n\nThey ultimately identified the suspect as Drake, and obtained a murder warrant against him.\n\n\"Beginning with almost no information and a false name, the shared resources of VCU working together and the processes used in this case to identify Drake should be considered a major success,'' he said.\n\n\"At the time of the warrant and the beginning of the law enforcement search, Drake should not have known that he had been identified by VCU but believed that he had escaped unidentified,'' Kennedy said. \"It was hoped that this would aid in his capture.\"\n\nKennedy said the U.S. Marshal's Service was called in to help search for Drake and multiple lookout bulletins were issued nationwide.\n\n\"Since that time the VCU and marshals have been working diligently to locate Drake in multiple locations throughout the country,'' he said.\n\nKennedy said Alabama investigators are working with authorities in Oklahoma as the search and investigation continues.\n\nDrake has an extensive criminal history in multiple states, including robberies, carjackings, and kidnappings.\n\nDrake has committed crimes in Alabama before. In 2010 he was arrested and later indicted for numerous crimes in Pickens County.\n\nDrake was convicted in the Feb. 21, 2010, carjacking of a 1993 GMC Sonoma. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison but placed on supervised release.\n\nThat supervised release was revoked in 2019, and Drake was revoked in 2019 and he was ordered in 2021 to serve 10 months with credit for time served.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in 2022 to first-degree robbery in Dale County, and received a 120-month suspended sentence.\n\nDrake is a white male with brown hair and eyes. He is 5-feet, 11-inches tall and weighs 185 pounds.\n\nAnyone with information on Drake's whereabouts is asked to contact 911, the OSBI at 1-800-522-8017 or tips@osbi.ok.gov.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

not alone.\n\nKATV has been working to get more information about this man and has talked to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations and Arkansas State Police.\n\nAuthorities claim Drake is armed and dangerous and is connected to a double homicide in Gans, Oklahoma in Sequoyah County.\n\nAccording to the Morrilton Police Department, Drake also has an active warrant for a homicide in Alabama.\n\nOklahoma State Bureau of Investigations Public Information Manager, Hunter McKee, said OSBI got involved Tuesday after they got word of the double murder.\n\n\"There are two deceased persons and this all started around 6:30 last night (Tuesday night),\" McKee said. \"The Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office was alerted that somebody had found a man and a woman dead inside of a local business.\"\n\nMcKee continued to say, \"They were able to determine that both the man and woman inside sustained injuries consistent with a homicide.\"\n\nDrake is no stranger to law enforcement as he is already a convicted felon with a long list of crimes like burglary, kidnapping, armed robbery, and aggravated assault against a law enforcement officer.\n\n\"The two deceased persons were found in Oklahoma and it was believed that at some point Mr. Drake had stolen a vehicle from that area and that stolen vehicle was found in Arkansas,\" said McKee.\n\nThat stolen car was found at a hotel in Morrilton.\n\nAuthorities searched the hotel and surrounding area, but Drake was nowhere to be found.\n\nMcKee said when something like this happens, they waste no time reaching out to nearby states so everyone can keep their eyes out and ears open.\n\n\"As soon as we were able to identify Mr. Drake, we let Arkansas authorities know and we have been working constantly with them, all night, all

Jack Kennedy said Thursday afternoon. \"If you look at his criminal history, he was continuously escalating his violent behavior.\"\n\n\"He is now responsible for at least three, possibly four, homicides that we know about in the last two months so I would not be surprised if there's other homicides out there that are unsolved in other jurisdictions,'' Kennedy said.\n\nDrake allegedly travelled to multiple states with no fixed address, using false names, and altering his appearance.\n\n\"We do not know if he is responsible for any other homicides but that is being looked into,'' he said. \"There are a few other things that have come to light, and we are working with a few other jurisdictions on that as well.\"\n\nAsked if Drake is a suspected serial killer, Kennedy said, \"I don't know if there is an official designator for that, but it does appear at a minimum he's killed three, possibly four, in the past two months.\"\n\nIn Alabama, Drake is charged with murder in the May 14 slaying of 62-year-old Russell Thomas \"Rusty\" Andrews.\n\nHe was taken captured about 10 a.m. Thursday in a wooded area south of the intersection of University Boulevard and Poor Farm Road in Morrilton, Arkansas.\n\nAndrews' son, Russell Andrews, said he's relieved he doesn't have to worry about the suspect \"tearing any more families apart.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he's finally going to face his consequences,'' he said. \"My heart goes out to all of the families affected.\"\n\n\"I can't thank the Conway County Sheriff's Office, the Morrilton Police Department, Arkansas State Police, Jack Kennedy and the violent crimes unit enough for all their hard work,'' Russell Andrews said.\n\nKennedy released new information about Andrews' slaying Thursday and confirmed that the longtime Alcoholics Anonymous volunteer was fatally shot.\n\nAndrews was found slain that Tuesday inside the AA building on Jack Warner Parkway. His vehicle was missing when he was discovered.\n\nInvestigators learned that Andrews was last seen talking to a man - now identified as Drake.\n\n\"He stayed behind talking with this gentleman after everyone left,'' Kennedy said. \"Nobody knows what the motive is, but (those who police spoke with at AA) all said he would have given him his car and his money if he had just asked for it.\"\n\nKennedy said investigators started with little to no information.\n\n\"We did not know who he had been with or the exact time this occurred,'' he said. \"We rapidly learned the suspect was a newly arrived transient or traveler that had only been in Tuscaloosa a week or possibly two.\"\n\nDetectives put out a request for information - releasing a description and possible nickname for the suspect, which turned out to be a false name.\n\nThrough the use of multiple investigative tools and techniques, they identified Drake as the potential suspect. \"Multiple people who had been associated with him that week picked him out of lineups,'' Kennedy said.\n\nThe murder warrant was then secured.\n\nAndrews' stolen vehicle was later located around the border of Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\n\"He was definitely outside of Tuscaloosa County,'' Kennedy said, and the U.S. Marshal's fugitive task for was brought in to lead the hunt.\n\n\"He was using a false name and dressing himself differently, using glasses and hats,'' Kennedy said, \"which starts to make sense now that we know about his past and what he's done since then.\"\n\nLookout bulletins were issued to law enforcement agencies nationwide, but investigators did not publicly release the suspect's identity.\n\n\"It was reasonable to believe that he did not know he had been identified by us,'' Kennedy said. \"We thought that would aid in us capturing him - the fact that he would believe he had gotten away with it.\"\n\nThree people were killed this week in Oklahoma - one victim in El Reno, and the other two in Gans. Those locations are about three hours apart.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation responded to a double homicide in Gans.\n\nDeputies about 6:30 p.m. responded to a business near State Highway 64 and South 4670 Road. When they arrived, they found a man and woman dead inside a business.\n\nBoth had injuries consistent with homicide, state authorities said, but did not elaborate.\n\nDetails of the third homicide in El Reno weren't immediately available but OSBI said three people were killed during two separate carjackings.\n\nDrake is separately wanted on multiple felony warrants from multiple jurisdictions, with charges including aggravated robbery, carjacking, and murder, authorities said.\n\nThe vehicle Drake reportedly took during one of the Oklahoma crimes was found late Tuesday night parked at a hotel in Morrilton, Arkansas.\n\nMorrilton police said Wednesday that Drake was seen on video in the hotel's parking lot. The hotel was searched but Drake was not located.\n\nArkansas State Police said Wednesday night that Drake was last known to have purchased camping gear and all indications are he is still in the Morrilton area.\n\nDrake has committed crimes in Alabama before. In 2010 he was arrested and later indicted for numerous crimes in Pickens County.\n\nDrake was convicted in the Feb. 21, 2010, carjacking of a 1993 GMC Sonoma. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison but placed on supervised release.\n\nThat supervised release was revoked in 2019, and Drake was revoked in 2019 and he was ordered in 2021 to serve 10 months with credit for time served..\n\nHe pleaded guilty in 2022 to first-degree robbery in Dale County, and received a 120-month suspended sentence.\n\nKennedy said Drake still has an outstanding federal charge.\n\n\"It appears he was traveling the country utilizing false names in an attempt to keep from being incarcerated,'' he said. \"What led him to become a person that violently assaults and murders people, I do not know.\"\n\nKennedy said roughly 50 investigators have worked on Andrews' case, and said it was a 24-7 probe.\n\n\"We are confident he is responsible for Mr. Andrews' murder here in Tuscaloosa,'' he said. . We never quit working on that case.\n\nSaid 50 different people working 24 hours a day to identify him.\n\n\"When it all works the way it's supposed to work, it's very reassuring to me,'' Kennedy said.\n\n\"We can't bring Mr. Andrews back but we can make good cases against this guy so he doesn't get out and victimize anyone else.\"", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

and a woman dead inside of a local business.\"\n\nMcKee continued to say, \"They were able to determine that both the man and woman inside sustained injuries consistent with a homicide.\"\n\nDrake is no stranger to law enforcement as he is already a convicted felon with a long list of crimes like burglary, kidnapping, armed robbery and aggravated assault against a law enforcement officer.\n\n\"The two deceased persons were found in Oklahoma and it was believed that at some point Mr. Drake had stolen a vehicle from that area and that stolen vehicle was found in Arkansas,\" said McKee.\n\nThat stolen car was found at a hotel in Morrilton.\n\nAuthorities searched the hotel and surrounding area, but Drake was nowhere to be found.\n\nMcKee said when something like this happens, they waste no time reaching out to nearby states so everyone can keep their eyes out and ears open.\n\n\"As soon as we were able to identify Mr. Drake, we let Arkansas authorities know and we have been working constantly with them, all night, all morning and we will continue to until he is found,\" McKee said.\n\nDrake is described as 5 feet 11 inches with brown hair and brown eyes weighing 185 pounds, according to state police.\n\nWednesday evening police said Drake was known to have purchased camping gear and all indications are he is still in the Morrilton area.", "source": {"uri":

In addition to counts of carjacking and brandishing a firearm, he was also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nThe indictment cites Drake's previous convictions in Arizona from 1994 and 2003.\n\nIn court documents filed in the Northern District of Alabama on August 27, 2010, Drake pleaded guilty to all three charges.\n\nAfter Drake's 1994 and 2003 convictions, he was classified as an Armed Career Criminal and Career Offender, leading to an enhanced sentence.\n\nHe was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Additionally, upon release, court documents say Drake was bound to 60 months of supervised release and to pay restitution of $2,500 to the victim.\n\nDue to his status as a career criminal, Drake's 2010 prison sentence was enhanced. This is also known as the \"three strikes law\" -- where, if a person is convicted of their third felony, they face an increased prison sentence on the third felony conviction.\n\nIn court documents filed on June 24, 2016, Drake requested that he be resentenced after arguing that his enhanced sentence no longer was valid due to a Supreme Court decision that reconstituted what was considered a violent felony.\n\nDrake became entitled to be resentenced without the career offender enhancements because one of the two Arizona felony convictions no longer qualified as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA or as a \"crime of violence,\" court documents said.\n\nDrake's motion to vacate his sentence was granted in a court order on March 23, 2017. He was resentenced to just over 11 years in prison and was given credit for time served since his arrest in 2010.\n\nIn the years following his resentencing, Drake was released and was in and out of custody for various crimes.\n\nAt one point, he was wanted by authorities but was later apprehended and in U.S. Marshal custody.\n\nDrake was arrested in March 2022 for first-degree robbery that \"occurred simultaneously\" during the 2010 incident, according to a court document out of Dale County, Alabama.\n\nDrake took a plea bargain for that charge, where he received 36 months of unsupervised probation.\n\nOn the night of Tuesday, June 18, Sequoyah County deputies responded to a double homicide at LaFerry's Propane in Gans.\n\nThe next day, Arkansas and Oklahoma authorities announced a manhunt for Drake, who was identified as the suspect in the double homicide.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was announced that Oklahoma investigators believe Drake fled into Arkansas and was last seen in Morrilton.\n\nArkansas State Police said Drake had a homicide warrant out of Alabama, along with another killing in Oklahoma. 5NEWS hasn't been able to find evidence of the homicide in Alabama, and OSBI hasn't confirmed that Drake is a suspect in a third killing in the state.\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, authorities said they believe Drake was still in Morrilton, and is considered armed and dangerous.\n\nTo report a typo or grammatical error, please email\u202fKFSMDigitalTeam@tegna.com\u202fand detail which story you're referring to.", "source": {"uri": "5newsonline.com",

It was unclear whether Mr. Drake had a lawyer.\n\n\"What led him to become a person that violently assaults and murders people? I do not know,\" Capt. Jack Kennedy, the commander of the violent crimes unit for the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office in Alabama, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday, a man and woman were found dead at a propane business in Gans, Okla., in the eastern part of the state, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement on Wednesday. The man and woman, Taylor Sharp and Tara Underwood, had been shot to death, according to court records.\n\nInvestigators had identified Mr. Drake as a person of interest in the killings by looking at surveillance video. He was seen in the video leaving the business in Ms. Underwood's GMC Acadia, court records state.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoyah_County,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequoyah County, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sequoyah County, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrilton,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morrilton, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Morrilton, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_County,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conway County, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Conway County, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMC_Acadia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GMC Acadia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The filing said no other person was at the business until Underwood's fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe vehicle was later found at a motel in Morrilton. Drake was reportedly seen on the motel's security camera in the same clothes and gloves as the surveillance footage in Gans.\n\nDrake provided an Alabama driver's license to the Morrilton motel.\n\nHe is reportedly tied to four homicides.\n\nIn addition to the two deaths in Gans, Drake has been connected to a homicide investigation in El Reno, Oklahoma, where 56-year-old Phillip Emerson was found dead at a residence on June 14, the El Reno Police Department confirmed to Nexstar's KFOR.\n\nDrake is also connected to a homicide investigation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where 62-year-old Russell

Andrews' vehicle has yet to be recovered.\n\nOn June 18, Drake was named as the suspect in three homicide cases out of Oklahoma.

At the time, the Tuscaloosa Violent Crimes Unit had little to go on besides a description of the man who may have been responsible.\n\nWhile Andrews' vehicle, which had gone missing after his death, was captured on a camera near the Arkansas/Oklahoma border hours after his death, the trail went cold. VCU identified Drake with the help of agencies in that area and obtained a warrant for Andrews' death, but Drake remained elusive.\n\nThat is, until he became a suspect in a June 18 Oklahoma double homicide.\n\nAnd just after 10 a.m. Thursday, June 20, Andrews got the news he'd been praying for ever since his father's death: The man accused of killing his father was found in Arkansas and is now in police custody.\n\n\"For a long time I wondered if they'd ever catch him,\" Andrews said. \"It makes us feel great.\"\n\nBut that elation is tempered, Andrews said, because Drake's capture came after even more tragedy.\n\n\"That's just pure evil,\" Andrews said. \"The past 24 hours have been really tough. I've just been reliving it all over again, knowing that there are other families who are going through exactly what I went through a month ago.\"\n\nAt the time of Andrews' death, VCU had few details about the man suspected of the deed. They knew he was homeless, went by the name J.P. and was no longer in the area.\n\nAfter Drake's apprehension Thursday, VCU Commander Capt. Jack Kennedy shared additional details about the investigation.\n\n\"I was there that day,\" Kennedy said. \"We were thinking outside of the box doing everything we possibly could. We were swinging for the fences and then one of them was a home run. Once we had that one lead, we were able to confirm it.\"\n\nKennedy said many of Andrews' friends and family couldn't understand why he was a target.\n\n\"Everybody we talked to couldn't understand why he had to be (killed),\" Kennedy said. \"Nobody knows what the motive is. (Drake) stole his car, but maybe he's just a killer, we don't know. They all said (Andrews) would've just given him his car and his money if he would've just asked for it.\"\n\nKennedy said they identified Drake as a suspect with 24 hours of Andrews' death.\n\nOn June 18, a man and a woman were found dead inside a business near Gans, Oklahoma, near the Arkansas state line, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Their deaths were ruled a homicide and the Oklahoma SBI identified Drake as a person of interest in the murders.\n\nVCU said Drake has an extensive criminal history of robberies, carjackings and kidnappings in multiple states including Alabama. In 2010, Drake was indicted in a robbery and carjacking in Gordo that was part of a multi-state crime spree. He served 10 years in prison in that case.\n\nKennedy said Drake was supposed to be on federal probation for those crimes but never reported to the probation office.\n\nDrake is currently being held at the Conway County Detention Center in Arkansas. There is no word on when he will be extradited to Tuscaloosa.", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCU_Rams_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "VCU Rams men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

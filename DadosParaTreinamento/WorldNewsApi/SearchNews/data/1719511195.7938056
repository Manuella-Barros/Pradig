{"id": 223748716, "title": "Your CT Eversource bill is going up \u2014 and going down. Here&#8217;s how it works and why.", "text": "For frustrated Connecticut electricity customers, there\u2019s good news and bad news. The good news is that one portion of their complicated bill will be going down on July 1. The bad news is that a different portion of the bill will be going up \u2014 at the same time. Customers are often confused when they look at the numerous line items on their bill that show different charges that add up to an overall charge. In addition to the confusion, Connecticut has consistently ranked for years near the top for the highest electricity rates in the continental United States. Here are some highlights of the complex system: How does this work? Ever since the market in Connecticut was deregulated more than two decades ago, customers have paid one cost for the generation of the electricity and then a separate cost for the delivery of that electricity to their homes. Under a pending proposal by Eversource, the largest utility company in the state, the cost for generating electricity would drop from 14.71 cents per kilowatt-hour to 8.99 cents on July 1. That would remain in effect for six months and must be approved by state regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which has butted heads with Eversource at times on various issues. Eversource and others stress that, under state law, the company makes no profits on the generating cost of electricity because it buys power from other suppliers and then sends it directly to customers. \u201cA lower price for energy is certainly good news for customers, and we\u2019re glad it will help to largely offset an increase in [a separate] portion of the bill covering the cost to run state-mandated programs,\u201d said Steve Sullivan, Eversource\u2019s president for electric operations in Connecticut. \u201cUnfortunately, volatility in customer bills remains an issue, and we\u2019re committed to helping to mitigate those impacts for customers, which is why we\u2019ve proactively proposed solutions that would create rate stability to help businesses and families plan their budgets.\u201d Rest of the bill At the same time that the generation portion of the bill will drop for customers, \u201call residential electric customers will see an increase of nearly $48 per month for 10 months to the \u2018public benefits\u2019 portion of their bill, which covers costs for state-required and approved programs and policies,\u201d Sullivan said. Currently, about 77% of Eversource customers use the standard service \u2014 meaning that they pay the rate offered by Eversource and do not shop around for lower generating rates that are available on the internet from other companies as part of electricity deregulation. Customers taking the Eversource standard service and using an average of 700 kilowatt hours monthly \u201cwill see a net increase of approximately $8, or 4%, on their total bill\u201d after the various pluses and minuses are calculated, Sullivan said. AARP One of the groups that has closely followed the rate increases for decades is AARP, which represents the interests of senior citizens at the state Capitol and beyond. John Erlingheuser, the group\u2019s senior associate state director, said the bills can be highly complicated and confusing. \u201cDo I think the public is going to understand what happens on July 1? Probably not,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve created this whole kind of Rube Goldberg system of changing suppliers, and it\u2019s frankly not worth it. We could lower the rate for everybody and not have to go through that. People say, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle.\u2019 \u2026 But that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother issue.\u201d He believes that the system is purposely complex. \u201cThere\u2019s no simple way of explaining all this,\u201d Erlingheuser said. \u201cI think that when this was done, particularly deregulation, it was meant to be complicated so people didn\u2019t understand it. I think so. I honestly do.\u201d The system of third-party suppliers is complicated, and some consumers have given up on the idea of searching for suppliers and simply take the standard offer from the utility. \u201cFor the generation supply, Eversource and United Illuminating, depending where you live in the state, make no profit off that particular portion of the bill,\u201d Erlingheuser said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pass-through cost. As a deregulated utility, they actually have no skin in the game in terms of the cost of the generation. \u2026 Now, it is welcome news that portion of the bill is going down because it did shoot up so high over the last year and a half that it will at least bring some relief to people who have not chosen a third-party electric supplier. \u2026 It\u2019s a very complicated thing.\u201d Still, when the smoke clears, Connecticut customers are still paying high electric rates. \u201cWe have a saying that it\u2019s like ripping my eyeballs out and telling me it\u2019s midnight,\u201d Erlingheuser said. \u201cWe\u2019re all paying more than we should. If I\u2019m paying double what I should, and you\u2019re giving me a 25% discount off that, how am I saving money?\u201d Why was electricity deregulated? In the 1990s, Connecticut was under pressure to join the growing trend of deregulating the electricity industry. The following anecdote explains part of the story : It was December 1996, and an elegant Vermont hotel was decorated in grand fashion for Christmas, and for some high-profile government leaders. Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland was there at the Equinox Hotel to meet with Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, other New England governors and more than 100 utility regulators, lobbyists and government leaders. The major topic of the day was electricity deregulation, a complicated, emerging concept that was still in its infancy. A roundtable discussion featured speeches about its pros and cons. The most aggressive proponent, listed among the \u201cspecial guests,\u201d urged the governors to move as quickly as possible into the bold new world of electricity competition. \u201cEvery day we delay [deregulation], we\u2019re costing consumers a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be done quickly. The key is to get legislation done fast.\u201d His name? Jeffrey Skilling of Enron. At the time, nearly 28 years ago, Skilling was unknown outside the small, insular world of utility insiders and Enron corporate headquarters in Houston. Fast forward, the former chief executive officer of Enron was sent to a Minnesota prison cell after being found guilty of 19 counts of securities fraud, conspiracy, lying to auditors and insider trading in one of the biggest corporate scandals in American history. When asked previously by The Courant, both Rowland and Dean said they could not recall that Skilling had spoken strongly at the Vermont conference for electricity deregulation. At AARP, Erlingheuser says some former legislators regret that they voted for deregulation. \u201cIt was one of the biggest mistakes we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were sold a bill of goods. I do agree it\u2019s almost impossible to put the genie back in the bottle when as it relates to generation because we forced the utilities to divest of generation. The ratepayers paid for that through stranded costs on their bills.\u201d Nationally, only 13 states have full electric deregulation like Connecticut. Those include much of the Northeast, including New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. Other states have partial electric deregulation, while some have deregulation of natural gas but not electricity. After a huge wave of deregulation in the late 1990s, no states have deregulated during the past 20 years. No PURA expansion Republican state lawmakers say the General Assembly did not do enough this year to hold down electricity rates for cash-strapped consumers. As part of their energy initiatives, Republicans said that PURA should become more independent by being broken off from the state environmental protection department after being merged into the same department under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Lamont has backed PURA\u2019s chairwoman, Marissa Gillette, who has tangled with Eversource in an ongoing battle on various issues. Eversource issued a stern warning in early May that it would sharply reduce its investments in reliability projects and clean energy due to a \u201cnegative\u201d climate imposed by state regulators. \u201cYou can have my assurance that we will not spend dollars until such time as we have a constructive regulatory environment that allows us to get fair treatment in the recovery of our dollars that we have spent on behalf of the customers in Connecticut to bring better service,\u201d Eversource chief executive officer Joe Nolan told utility analysts on a quarterly earnings that generated widespread attention. Despite that warning, Gov. Ned Lamont doubled down a few hours later and said he supports Gillette for another four-year term in heading PURA. When asked after the legislative session by The Courant, Lamont said that he was not immediately appointing two more members to the PURA board, which now can legally have five members instead of the current three, including Gillette. \u201cThe governor is ignoring the law,\u201d House Republican leader Vincent Candelora said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the bigger issue. If you wanted three, then advocate that the law be changed back to three. But what has happened is we have a governor that refuses to make the appointments so we can have a discussion about the way PURA is running.\u201d Like Lamont, Erlingheuser supports Gillette. \u201cDo I think she\u2019s doing a good job over there? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I think PURA is on the right path? Yes.\u201d In the end, many consumers do not closely follow the day-to-day actions of regulators, but they are often perturbed when they open their bills. \u201cWe\u2019re usually in the top three of the highest rates for electricity in the continental United States,\u201d Erlingheuser said. \u201cI understand people\u2019s frustration. That\u2019s why we have worked on it for so long. It is a frustrating experience for the public. We understand that, and that\u2019s why when there are these rate cases we fight tooth and nail to make sure that people don\u2019t get charged one penny more than they should get charged for.\u201d Christopher Keating can be reached at ckeating@courant.com", "summary": "For frustrated Connecticut electricity customers, there's good news and bad news and it's all about our bills.", "url": "https://www.courant.com/2024/05/26/your-ct-eversource-bill-is-going-up-and-going-down-heres-how-it-works-and-why/", "image": "https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/thc-l-smart-meter-01.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:47:36", "author": "Christopher Keating", "authors": ["Christopher Keating"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.338}

Don\u2019t recall Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was admonished for leaving the commemoration for the 80th anniversary of D-Day early, and will be eager to push his party\u2019s promises to servicemen and women on Armed Forces Day. He will hail their \u201cduty, dedication and selfless personal sacrifice\u201d and claim the Conservatives are the only party promising to meet the Help for Heroes Veterans\u2019 Pledge. As well as reiterating the Tories\u2019 manifesto pledge to the armed forces including increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030, Mr Sunak will also reassert his party\u2019s commitment to the Northern Ireland Legacy Act. \u2013 Returning politics to service, with a government of service for those who serve Sir Keir Starmer will promise Labour will be a \u201cgovernment of service, for those who serve\u201d and that they will \u201calways ensure that those who defend our country have their voices heard at the highest level\u201d. The Labour leader and shadow defence secretary John Healey will mark Armed Forces Day by joining a veterans\u2019 coffee morning in the South East of England, where the pair will outline how the next Labour government aims to pay tribute through action. They will announce new powers for Labour\u2019s planned Armed Forces Commissioner who will be able to investigate and report on issues which affect the lives of service personnel such as substandard housing, faulty kit and poor discharge support. On Saturday evening, Sir Keir and deputy leader Angela Rayner will tell an event in London that if people want change they have to vote for it, as Labour enters the final weekend before polling day fighting their toughest opponent yet \u2013 voter apathy. \u2013 Davey goes the distance Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will embark on an epic 1,343-mile tour of seats from John O\u2019Groats in northern Scotland to Land\u2019s End in Cornwall in the final days of the campaign. By the party\u2019s calculations, the final marathon push will mean that by the end of the campaign, Sir Ed will have travelled further than the distance from London to California (a trek not novel to his Conservative counterpart). The Yellow Hammer 1 will grace Lib Dem target seats as the party aims to show it is gaining in strength in communities across the country, from rural constituencies in the Highlands and West Country to former Conservative heartlands in the South East. -Labour will win warning In a rare overlap in messaging with Reform UK, the SNP will tell voters a Labour Government is a forgone conclusion. SNP leader John Swinney will be campaigning in the seats of Falkirk, Alloa & Grangemouth and Bathgate & Linlithgow, as he claims only SNP MPs will hold the next Government to account on austerity cuts. With less than a week until polls open and predictions of SNP losses to Labour, Mr Swinney will say that Scotland is the only place where the electoral outcome remains on a knife edge.", "summary": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will aim to win back support from veterans on Armed Forces Day.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/conservatives-john-healey-labour-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-b1167601.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/29/07/cfaf456c80b551c847a84c28f9c49847Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE5NzAxMTYw-2.75227792.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:00:55", "author": "Claudia Savage", "authors": ["Claudia Savage"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.325}

In the first three months of this year, the highest-ever number of complaints was submitted to The Motor Ombudsman's dispute resolution service totalling 1,604 \u2014 a 35 per cent rise on last year. And a survey by car service firm Fixter reveals 56 per cent of motorists feel they have been overcharged by a mechanic recently. Here's our anti-scam toolkit to avoid rip-off repairs. Seal of approval Use a garage accredited to The Motor Ombudsman (TMO)'s Service and Repair Code. This means it is committed to giving the best standard of work and service. Find one using TMO's Garage Finder tool (themotorombudsman.org/Garage-Finder) or look for TMO logos at the garage. Safety first: Use a garage accredited to The Motor Ombudsman's Service and Repair Code Shop around Don't be frightened to compare prices from local Motor Ombudsman-accredited garages. Estimates vs quotes Ensure you understand the difference. An estimate is a breakdown of costs intended as a guide of what's required which could go up or down. A quote is a specific costing and should also be in writing with a breakdown and price agreed before work starts. Photo records Take photos of the mileage and condition of the car inside and out when you drop it off. Let the garage know you've done so. This helps to prevent disagreements on collection, such as pre-existing scratches and whether personal possessions were left inside.

Garages should not require deposits or prepayments for service and repair work, nor should you be subjected to pressurised selling. If you are, walk away. The bill please Check that your final bill shows the agreed work and that the price tallies with your quote. If additional work was agreed later, ensure that this is clearly detailed. Keep the final invoice as part of your service history. Proof of servicing will be needed in the event of a warranty claim. Resolving differences IF a dispute should arise, always try to resolve the issue directly with the garage first. If something goes wrong, put your complaint in writing. The garage has up to eight weeks to get back to you with its response. Read more of Ray's motoring tips exclusively on Mail Plus.

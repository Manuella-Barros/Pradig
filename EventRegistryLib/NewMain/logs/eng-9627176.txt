Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\n\"We speak to a broader audience,\" said Snoop Dogg, who has been brought on as a primetime NBC correspondent for Paris. The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a Peacock program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cayden_steele@nj.com", "name": "Cayden Steele", "type": "author",

He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated

Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\n\"We speak to a broader audience,\" said Snoop Dogg, who has been brought on as a primetime NBC correspondent for Paris. The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner.

Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We speak to a broader audience,\" said Snoop Dogg, who has been brought on as a primetime NBC correspondent for Paris.

But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about Texas gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more sports coverage from The Dallas Morning News, click here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas

Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\n\"We speak to a broader audience,\" said Snoop Dogg, who has been brought on as a primetime NBC correspondent for Paris. The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES -- NBC is inserting some pop culture flavor into the world's biggest sports spectacle: From Megan Thee Stallion dancing with dressage horses at the Palace of Versailles to Peyton Manning riding a giant baguette blimp over the Eiffel Tower, the network has strategically partnered with several big names to build anticipation for the Paris Olympics.\n\nEnlisting a plethora of entertainers and non-Olympic athletes is designed to entice viewers after the network -- and longtime Olympics broadcaster in the U.S. -- drew lackluster ratings for the last Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, and the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices.

The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe

Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES -- NBC is inserting some pop culture flavor into the world's biggest sports spectacle: From Megan Thee Stallion dancing with dressage horses at the Palace of Versailles to Peyton Manning riding a giant baguette blimp over the Eiffel Tower, the network has strategically partnered with several big names to build anticipation for the Paris Olympics.\n\nEnlisting a plethora of entertainers and non-Olympic athletes is designed to entice viewers after the network -- and longtime Olympics broadcaster in the U.S. -- drew lackluster ratings for the last Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, and the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES -- NBC is inserting some pop culture flavor into the world's biggest sports spectacle: From Megan Thee Stallion dancing with dressage horses at the Palace of Versailles to Peyton Manning riding a giant baguette blimp over the Eiffel Tower, the network has strategically partnered with several big names to build anticipation for the Paris Olympics.\n\nEnlisting a plethora of entertainers and non-Olympic athletes is designed to entice viewers after the network -- and longtime Olympics broadcaster in the U.S. -- drew lackluster ratings for the last Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, and the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES -- NBC is inserting some pop culture flavor into the world's biggest sports spectacle: From Megan Thee Stallion dancing with dressage horses at the Palace of Versailles to Peyton Manning riding a giant baguette blimp over the Eiffel Tower, the network has strategically partnered with several big names to build anticipation for the Paris Olympics.\n\nEnlisting a plethora of entertainers and non-Olympic athletes is designed to entice viewers after the network -- and longtime Olympics broadcaster in the U.S. -- drew lackluster ratings for the last Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, and the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of

Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nThis year's Olympics will be Taylor's third stint at the event with NBC and will cover the games from across the city.\n\nShe hosted the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the Beijing Olympics in 2022 for NBC.\n\nTaylor's show will be based on Team USA's boat on the River Seine during the opening ceremonies before going on tour to different venues.\n\n\"We're excited that Maria, who anchors the most watched studio show in sports on NFL Sundays, will host our Late Night show with one of the world's greatest cities as her stage,\" Molly Solomon, Executive Producer and President, NBC Olympics Production, said.\n\n\"Each night under the Parisian lights, she will put her stamp on the day, with a look at the must-watch moments and best events, and some surprise guests stopping by.\"\n\nTaylor also expressed her excitement to once again host the Olympic show for NBC.\n\n\"Ever since I attended the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, it was a dream of mine to compete in the Games, which has now evolved to covering them,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"As host of the Late Night show, I'm excited to tell the best stories of the day while moving about the city and hosting from the venues, cafes, plazas, and famous landmarks of Paris, one of the world's most inspirational cities.\"\n\nTaylor is getting warmed up for her Olympic coverage in Paris this week at the Roland-Garros tennis matches.\n\nShe is anchoring coverage of the matches as well as providing interviews of the champions on the court.\n\nThis year's Olympics will be the third time Paris is hosting the games since the modern format's inception in 1894.\n\nThat figure is tied for the most times hosting the games with London, and Los Angeles will match that with their hosting in 2028.\n\nParis is also working to showcase their city during the games by hosting events at major landmarks.\n\nBeach volleyball will take place at the base of the Eiffel Tower while urban sports will be hosted at Place De la Concorde.\n\nEquestrian will have the special honor of being held at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nThe Paris Olympics are also debuting a new event that was never seen at the games.\n\nBreakdancing is a new event that is making its debut at the 2024 games.\n\nTokyo debuted a lot of new events in 2021 that will make their second appearances, including skateboarding and surfing.\n\nInterestingly, surfing won't take place in Paris, but instead on the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia.\n\nThree on three basketball is also returning in Paris after debuting in Tokyo.", "source": {"uri":

Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES -- NBC is inserting some pop culture flavor into the world's biggest sports spectacle: From Megan Thee Stallion dancing with dressage horses at the Palace of Versailles to Peyton Manning riding a giant baguette blimp over the Eiffel Tower, the network has strategically partnered with several big names to build anticipation for the Paris Olympics.\n\nEnlisting a plethora of entertainers and non-Olympic athletes is designed to entice viewers after the network -- and longtime Olympics broadcaster in the U.S. -- drew lackluster ratings for the last Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, and the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Held amid the coronavirus pandemic, those Games proceeded with muted fanfare and few announcers on-site.\n\nBut with over 11 million expected to attend the two-week Summer Games that start July 26, NBC -- which holds the broadcasting rights to the Olympics through 2032 -- wants to attract more viewers by bringing Olympic stories to life with popular and diverse personalities.\n\nPeople are also reading... 2024 GENE \"PAPPY\" THOMPSON WINNER: Enduring legacy crafted by Eastside's ultra-talented Taylor Clay County applies road designation to new four-lane U.S. 58 VHSL State Quarterfinal Capsules.

The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.\n\nSnoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng.\n\n\"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage. Network researchers found that people between the ages of 26-40 wanted an Olympics that infuses more pop culture into the everyday conversation.\n\nSinger Kelly Clarkson and NFL legend Peyton Manning will join sportscaster Mike Tirico in Paris as hosts of the opening ceremony along the Seine, held for the first time outside a stadium setting. Comedian Leslie Jones will contribute to on-air and social media coverage. Podcaster Alex Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy\" fame will host live, interactive watch parties in Paris called \"Watch with Alex Cooper,\" a program where she'll appear in a picture-in-picture view sharing her insights and answering questions from fans in real time.\n\n\"I'm not a former Olympian, but they sort of convinced me that we are just celebrating these athletes and a little bit about what drives them,\" said Manning, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and two-time Super Bowl winner. He's also the co-host of the ESPN-produced \"Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli\" with his brother and fellow former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.\n\nHart returns too, collaborating with Kenan Thompson on an eight-episode commentary series offering comical recaps of the best and most unexpected Olympic moments.\n\n\"It's under the umbrella of sports, but it's really a cultural celebration,\" said Tirico, who will host his fourth opening ceremony of the Olympics. He will team up with Jimmy Fallon along with past Olympians Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir for NBC's closing ceremony coverage.\n\nTirico said integrating more pop culture elements into the coverage was a \"grand slam\" idea.\n\n\"If we bring a little cross-section of America together to give you a flavor of the games and do it under one tent, it'll keep you around for 17 nights,\" he said. \"That's our plan. Our goal. We're so glad that we've got people like Snoop, Peyton, Kelly and to help us do it.\"\n\nAlong with Megan Thee Stallion and Manning's commercials, several other promotional spots have already aired on NBC: Rapper Cardi B appeared in a promo, getting her nails done with track star Sha'Carri Richardson. Actor Lily Collins reprised her \"Emily in Paris\" role to pitch executives a new wardrobe idea for sprinter Noah Lyles. Paris Hilton helped reveal the Olympics logo. Dolly Parton collaborated with the network on a video for her cover of \"We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You,\" which has been used to promote coverage.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist,\" said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. \"We wanted to make sure that it feels like more than just a sporting event. It's really an entertainment and pop culture event that is centered around athletes stories.\"\n\nSo far, the commercials have generated strong numbers. According to NBC, Collins' promo spot drew more than 30 million viewers on the network's platforms. Megan Thee Stallion's ad garnered 12 million views, while Snoop Dogg pulled in just under 10 million through their social media channels.\n\n\"We tried to remain very true to our audiences and the placement of the content,\" said Jennifer Storms, NBC's chief marketing officer of Entertainment and Sports. \"We're working together on the talent and how they have a continuous storyline before the Olympics and through the Olympics.\"\n\nStorms wants to bring Olympians' stories to the forefront through popular voices. Expect stories from singer John Legend about gymnast Simone Biles, WWE star Cody Rhodes on wrestler David Taylor and \"Chicago Fire\" actor Eamonn Walker on Lyles, she said.\n\n\"That translates to telling the story around an athlete that America might not know yet,\" Storms said. \"So the talent are critical to catching people's attention.\"\n\nManning hopes to make an influential mark. He's looking forward to delving into the backstories of Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\n\"Maybe athlete to athlete,\" Manning said, \"they will share some information that maybe they just wouldn't tell anybody.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of

NBCUniversal plans to have Taylor reporting live from Team USA's boat as it makes its way down the River Seine during NBC and Peacock's coverage of the Paris Opening Ceremony on July 26.\n\nThe ceremony, running along the River Seine, will feature 100 boats carrying thousands of athletes from more than 200 countries traveling past spectators seated on the banks of the famed Paris body of water. The four-mile boat parade will conclude at the Eiffel Tower.\n\nBut that's just one part of Taylor's Olympic assignment which will be announced later Tuesday. Her main role will be serving as the late-night host for the Paris Olympics on NBC and Peacock during the Games, which runs from July 26 to August 11.\n\n\"When highlight reels come up of the Paris Olympics, we are always going to remember that the athletes came into Paris on the Seine River,\" Taylor said in an interview this week. \"It's going to be a legendary moment. I remember I was at a Football Night In America meeting a couple of months ago and (NBC executive producer and president) Molly Solomon said she wanted to talk about something.\n\n\"She was like we still have to clear some things and don't get too excited yet but I think we are going to get you on the Team USA boat for the opening ceremony. So I knew for three months that maybe it was going to happen and then when it became official I was like, 'Oh my God, this is going to be something I could have never imagined or dreamed of doing.'\"\n\nAs for her late-night hosting assignment, Taylor said she would appear at different venues throughout Paris during the competition to make the city a central character of the late-night time slot. The show will begin following local news in all time zones. Mike Tirico will return as the host of NBC's primetime coverage.\n\nNBC announced last month Rebecca Lowe, Craig Melvin and Tirico were among NBC Olympics daytime hosts for the Paris Games.\n\nSaid Taylor on her late-night assignment: \"A lot of stuff will already have happened so we're trying to bring you things in a way that's fun and entertaining including bringing on notable guests.\"\n\nSince leaving ESPN in July 2021 in a well-documented exit, Taylor has hosted \"Football Night in America\" and the pregame show for NBC Sports' Big Ten Saturday Night college football series. She will be at the French Open this weekend for NBC. Paris will be Taylor's third Olympics for the network.\n\nLast December she welcomed her first child -- Roman Ryan Taylor Hemphill -- who will travel with her to the Games.\n\n\"When my departure from ESPN happened, I was depleted, exhausted, in a lot of ways torn down,\" Taylor said. \"I feel like the Olympics have restored me. Being in Tokyo and being a part of the opening ceremony there, it just revitalized my passion (for) working in sports broadcasting. I feel like I owe a lot to the athletes and the Olympics in general because of what that event now means to me and what it represents. It breathed a lot of life back into me.\n\n\"When I started in broadcasting, my goal was to be at the women's volleyball national championships and maybe host the women's basketball tournament. Now you're telling me that I get to host an Olympics where Mike Tirico and Bob Costas have stood in and talked about these things. You could tell me that I was going to do this under a rock at 2 a.m. and I'd be like, 'I'm hosting the Olympics!' I didn't know how much it would mean to me three years ago and now I even get to bring my baby to cover the Games.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

The ultra-smooth rapper had become a fan favorite during the Tokyo Games, when he and Kevin Hart did in-studio commentary for Peacock.Snoop Dogg will be on the ground in Paris by late July, exploring the city's landmarks and attending competitions and events. He's already had casual on-video interviews with a few Olympians about their respective sports, including women's basketball player A'ja Wilson, gymnast Sunisa Lee, skateboarder Jagger Eaton and beach volleyball players Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng. \"We have different perspectives and different views,\" Snoop Dogg said of the recruited entertainers. \"The world that we live in right now, it is appropriate for me to give our side of the story, because we've always been a great voice and a great instrument. But we've never been the conductor. Now I get to play the role of conductor.\"After the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, NBC created a new playbook to increase excitement for this summer's coverage.

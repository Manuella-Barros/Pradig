Less than a fortnight after an alarming report into the state of Play Store malware hit the headlines, here we are again. It\u2019s not just malware this time, it\u2019s broader. And with more than 2 billion installs across 100 popular apps, users need to start checking and deleting. Let\u2019s keep this stupidly simple. Do not use a free VPN\u2014not now, not ever. For the few people not yet familiar with virtual private networks whose popularity continues to surge, these apps shield your IP address and browsing activity from your network, ISP or anyone who might be listening in. The apps securely tunnel from your device to a third-party server, and then out to the open internet from there. ForbesGoogle Will Track Your Location For The Next 180 Days-Then It StopsBy Zak Doffman In a world of protests and threats to dissidents, lawyers, campaigners and journalists, to say nothing of territories that have clamped down on certain apps and platforms, VPNs are a lifeline. While places like China and Iran block apps at will, VPNs are the reason users in those countries can still get through. For a VPN to function effectively it needs a network of servers around the world, enabling users to either connect to one that\u2019s local or one that can present a location mask, trading a real IP address for one in a different country. Live in the UK and connect to a US server, for example, and you can appear to the open internet to be 3,000 miles from home. It doesn\u2019t always work when using apps on your phone, as anyone trying to subvert geographic broadcast restrictions might discover. There are other ways for an app on a device to check your location. There are ways around such blocks, but not for sharing.

And yet most VPNs remain free. And this is one of the great app ironies. The economic business model for a free app is to harvest your location, device and other data or to serve you ads. If you\u2019re lucky. If you\u2019re unlucky, the business model is to infect your phone with malware and steal login credentials or private information. The new warning to the millions upon millions of Android users falsely believing they have secured their phones comes from Top10VPN, which has just tested the \u201c100 most popular free Android VPN apps in the Google Play Store... with 2.5 billon worldwide installs between them,\u201d its aim, it says is \u201cto help you avoid using potentially unsafe free VPNs that compromise your privacy and security.\u201d Spoiler alert\u2014pretty much every one of those VPNs is a privacy or security disaster, or both. Just some of the issues the report sets out include: More than 10% of the apps \u201csuffered encryption failures, ranging from total exposure of internet activity to leaking details of websites visited.\u201d Almost 90% of the apps \u201csuffered some kind of leak, including 17 VPNs leaking more than DNS request data,\u201d while more than 50% \u201cshowed signs of VPN tunnel instability.\u201d Almost 70% of the apps \u201crequested at least one privacy-risking permission, such as location tracking (20%) and scanning for installed apps (46%).\u201d More than 80% of the apps \u201ccontained software development kits (SDKs) from marketing or social media platforms. 16 VPNs contained 10 or more of these SDKs.\u201d Almost one in three of the apps abused permission requests, seeking access to cameras or detailed location information, not required for core app functionality. Almost three-quarters of the apps \u201cshared personal data with third parties such as Facebook, Yandex, and data brokers like Kochava, including device fingerprints (37 VPNs) IP addresses (23 VPNs), and unique tracking IDs (61 VPNs).\u201d And most alarmingly, \u201calmost one in five (19%) of VPN apps tested were flagged as malware by anti-virus scanners,\u201d which is clearly the ultimate irony for a security app. The sheer scale of the growth in VPN usage makes these flaws critical; as Top10VPN comments \u201cthe 100 most popular free Android VPNs had around 260 million total installs in 2018. Today, that number exceeds 2.5 billion.\u201d A Forbes report suggests there are now 1.6 billion VPN users across the world. And so it\u2019s little surprise that Google has singled out these apps for special treatment by way of an accreditation that should assure users of an app\u2019s legitimacy. Here\u2019s the assured list\u2014do not stray beyond it. ForbesMicrosoft Issues New Warning For 70% Of All Windows UsersBy Zak Doffman Top10VPN conducted its own testing by installing each VPN \u201conto very basic, entry-level Samsung smartphones that had been stripped of all but the most basic stock apps,\u201d before conducting its tests. \u201cThe results were alarming,\u201d the report warns. \u201cSignificant numbers of these VPN apps put our privacy and security at risk due to serious encryption failures and data leaks... While it\u2019s little surprise then that most free VPN providers rely on advertising or monetizing their user data to cover costs and hopefully turn a profit, it\u2019s fundamentally at odds with the whole purpose of a VPN.\u201d I have approached Google for any comments on the report which makes bewildering reading, given the state of this software masquerading in Play Store\u2019s security aisle. But the detail is less important than the takeaways. Don\u2019t use free VPNs, stick to the accredited list and ideally use a well-known, reputable brand. There are cheaper or even near-free options, but the trade-offs seriously hobble the functionality. If you don\u2019t want to pay any kind of fee, don\u2019t bother with a VPN. Unfortunately, it really is that simple. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

{"id": 239735678, "title": "Grocery Store Shooting That Killed 3 Leaves an Arkansas Town in Disbelief", "text": "Thomas and Sharon Brazil were sitting in their car late Friday morning in front of the only grocery store in Fordyce, Ark., discussing what they wanted to buy to put on the grill that night. Then they noticed a man with a gun approaching them. He looked at them, Mr. Brazil said, \u201cand he shot.\u201d Mr. Brazil, a 65-year-old minister, was shot in the forehead above his right eye. Ms. Brazil suffered cuts from broken glass. They went to the hospital but both survived. They were among the lucky ones. All told, the police said that the gunman killed three people and injured 10 after he opened fire at the Mad Butcher grocery store. On Saturday, this town of 3,400 people, about 70 miles south of Little Rock, was only beginning to absorb the impact of the bloodshed, as a few details began to emerge. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the words,\u201d said Kasey Langley, whose daughter owns a flower shop a few doors down from the Mad Butcher. \u201cI woke up this morning thinking it was all a dream. This didn\u2019t happen, but it did.\u201d", "summary": "The small town of Fordyce, Ark., was beginning to absorb the impact of the bloodshed, as a few details began to emerge.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/us/arkansas-shooting-grocery-store.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/22/multimedia/22nat-arkansas-shooting-gfzv/22nat-arkansas-shooting-gfzv-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:42:30", "author": "Erica Sweeney", "authors": ["Erica Sweeney"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.624}

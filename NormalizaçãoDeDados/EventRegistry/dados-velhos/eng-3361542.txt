Last month, an amnesty was announced, in effect lifting the ban and allowing the likes of Gayle to be available for one-day selection.\n\n'West Indies have probably wasted more money on having to address legal issues with players than they have spent on developing young cricketers,' Grave told the Mail on Sunday.\n\n'The amnesty is about highlighting to the public the progress we're making and getting one or two of the big names back in the 50-over side.\n\n'When Evin Lewis hit a ridiculous T20 hundred against India recently, it was telling that the two guys who talked him through it from the other end were Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels. I'm hopeful we'll see them both in action against England.'\n\nFirst, though, West Indies must negotiate a three-match Test series, starting with Thursday's pink-ball match at Edgbaston, against an England team who are on a high after disposing of South Africa 3-1.\n\n'The perception is it will be no contest,' said Grave. 'All I'm hearing is each game will be over in three days, and Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson will blow us away. People view West Indies cricket as being in decline, and they'll see an England win as further evidence of that.\n\n'But we can take confidence from our recent performance at home against Pakistan. We've got the talent to compete - it's just a question of whether we have the confidence to put together 15 sessions.\n\n'This is a great opportunity for our players to make a name for themselves. I just hope that the likes of Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Shannon Gabriel, Alzarri Joseph and the captain Jason Holder can prove a few people wrong.'\n\nGrave is adamant that there remains plenty of ability on the Caribbean islands, despite a Test decline that has seen West Indies fail to win an away series anywhere other than Bangladesh or Zimbabwe for more than 22 years.\n\nGayle has predominantly played in domestic T20 franchise competitions around the world\n\n'West Indies won the Under-19 World Cup last year, and that team has just won a one-day series in South Africa, so the talent is clearly there,' he said. 'It's just about harnessing it. At the moment, we're a bit like England in the 1990s.\n\n'What I've tried to do with our new director of cricket Jimmy Adams and our new coach Stuart Law is bring a sense of stability to the game. The players aren't immune to problems at board level, but things are getting better.'\n\nAnd the new chief executive also believes that only success at Test level can alter the sense that West Indian cricket is on a slippery slope to nowhere.\n\n'Winning three global events as we did last year [the men's and women's World Twenty20, as well as the Under-19 World Cup] only provided a short-term boost. Long-term change only comes through Test cricket.\n\n'We're viewing these three games in England as the first of seven Tests, followed by two each against New Zealand and Zimbabwe. Hopefully by the end of it we'll have developed as a Test side.'\n\nThe temptation for England will be to underestimate West Indies, who have not won a Test in this country since 2000, nor a series since 1988. But, against a team desperate to prove they are not the no-hopers of popular wisdom, they will do so at their peril.\n\nBut tensions between the West Indies Cricket Board and its players have now

It is a formidable fixture, given the team's underwhelming performance back home during the just- concluded series against Pakistan and its poor showing on overseas tours over the years.\n\nThe West Indies will also be coming up against a strong English line-up on home soil, which recently wrapped up a series against South Africa beating them 3-1, their first home series win against South Africa since 1998. They also won the ODI series 2-1, as well as the T20 series 2-1.\n\nIt is no secret that the West Indies team has had a woeful overseas record over the last decade and more, in three Tests against the top-ranked team in Test cricket. And as if facing the third-ranked test team in the world in their home conditions wasn't tough enough, West Indies have been fielding for the longest while a team of youngsters -- many of whom have not yet conquered the game at the regional level. Key players such as Darren Bravo and Marlon Samuels are not on the tour due to various reasons involving Cricket West Indies (CWI).\n\nUndoubtedly, there have been some positive signs so far on the tour with the team declaring twice and bowling out their opponents in a fixture against country side Derbyshire, which ended on Sunday. In the game, West Indies amassed 427/3d & 327/6d in the two innings they batted. Notwithstanding this effort in the warm-up match, their game against the national team would be a different challenge.\n\nAgainst the background of all of this is that the West Indies are in a race to qualify for the 2019 World Cup. Recently, the cricket board offered \"temporary amnesty\" to the players who do not fit their selection criteria in order to have them available to play ODIs. This could pave the way for the return of players such as Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine, and Samuel Badree for the tour down under following the Test matches.\n\nCWI has had a stringent policy of picking only those players who are active in the domestic one-day tournament for 50-over internationals -- a rule which rendered many of the key players ineligible as they would opt to ply their trade around the globe playing T20 cricket. This tour of England, as much as it would give an indication as to the progress of the Test team under Coach Stuart Law, it is more about ensuring that the Caribbean men pick up valuable points which would guarantee them a place in the World Cup - the game's global showpiece which the West Indies has won twice. It would be the collective wish of every Caribbean fan that the team succeeds -- ensuring its place among the top nations that will compete in the tournament scheduled to be hosted by England and Wales, from 30 May to 15 July, 2019. This will be the 12th Cricket World Cup competition, and the fifth time it will be held in England and Wales.\n\nFor a nation that won the first two competitions in 1975 and 1979, it continues to trouble many endearing fans that the team risks missing out playing in the game's marquee tournament and this has to do principally with one issue -- the crisis of governance of cricket in the region. This has been a major factor in the decline in the fortunes of our team. Relations between the board and the players on the one hand and between the board and the support staff on the other hand, have deteriorated to the point where the public is frequently treated to public quarrels among the various sides -- the latest involving Darren Bravo and the President Dave Cameron. But the crisis has also been exacerbated by the attitude of the top players who often place money before service to the Region. In an era of boundless individualism, our cricketers have not been shy of openly showing preference for playing in the financially lucrative private leagues, rather than for the West Indies. We are never going to improve if our senior players do not participate in the local and regional competitions -- such participation is critical to lifting the standard of our domestic cricket. Similarly, if we do not make our boards more accountable to the people of the Region by democratising their structures and practices, there will always be tension, which in turn will impede progress.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2837, "imp": true, "textEnd": 2854, "date": "-05-30", "dateEnd": "2017-07-15", "amb": false}], "time": "04:41:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "04:41:00", "title": "WI tour of England and its World Cup place - Guyana Chronicle", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709026010", "image": "http://guyanachronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/editorial2.jpg", "source": {"title": "Guyana Chronicle", "uri": "guyanachronicle.com", "id": "5085"}, "id": "9004369", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 256}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100, "id": 865}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 100, "id": 866}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 867}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "id": "178", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "id": "247", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "id": "242110", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302607", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "id": "303251", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "type": "loc", "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305608", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305786", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309560", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309902", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309904", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "331193", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339771", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Bravo", "label": {"eng": "Darren Bravo"}, "type": "person", "id": "350197", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Samuels", "label": {"eng": "Marlon Samuels"}, "type": "person", "id": "363680", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_Bravo", "label": {"eng": "Dwayne Bravo"}, "type": "person", "id": "430225", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Gayle", "label": {"eng": "Chris Gayle"}, "type": "person", "id": "432664", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Narine", "label": {"eng": "Sunil Narine"}, "type": "person", "id": "433245", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Law", "label": {"eng": "Stuart Law"}, "type": "person", "id": "477532", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Pollard", "label": {"eng": "Kieron Pollard"}, "type": "person", "id": "485154", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Badree", "label": {"eng": "Samuel Badree"}, "type": "person", "id": "585905", "score": 2}]}

day-night match - the first in England - at Edgbaston on Thursday.\n\nThe tourists have lost six consecutive Test series, their last win coming against Bangladesh in 2014.\n\n\"I am concerned with the way we are playing,\" said 53-year-old Ambrose, who played 98 Tests for the West Indies.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show, he added: \"I am hoping they can at least win one Test or compete - but as a realist I am not too sure they will.\"\n\nWindies will be without several key men - including Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Darren Sammy and Marlon Samuels - after a number of disputes in the Caribbean between the board and its players.\n\nAmbrose says the inexperience in the squad is a \"serious problem\".\n\n\"I still believe if we had all those names, our cricket would better,\" he added of the side who are eighth in the Test rankings, above only Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.\n\nMany of West Indies' star names opt to play in lucrative global Twenty20 competitions rather than in the domestic league.\n\n\"Look at the Twenty20 squad, we have them players available and they have always been a force,\" said Ambrose, who took 405 Test wickets.\n\n\"According to the Cricket West Indies board, you have to be available to play all the first-class games in the region to be eligible for the Test team.\n\n\"I don't have a problem with that - but Cricket West Indies need to be more lenient with their players if they want their best team.\n\n\"So many players are starting their careers so have no-one to turn to who is a senior

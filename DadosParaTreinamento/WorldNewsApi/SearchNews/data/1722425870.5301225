On Friday, June 28, the 1985 romantic comedy, which was partially responsible for launching Moore, 61, to superstardom, celebrated its 39th anniversary. To mark the occasion, Moore put her own spin on the classic film. \u201cJules would have loved Brat Girl Summer. Happy 39th birthday to #StElmosFire!\u201d Moore captioned an Instagram Reels. The clip featured a video compilation of Moore as her romcom character Jules \u2014 a member of the seven-person group which later became known as the \"Brat Pack.\" The film also starred Emilio Estevez, Andrew McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy and Judd Nelson.

In a 1985 New York magazine article by David Blum, he decided to dub the then-teen actors the \u201cBrat Pack\u201d and the name has stuck for decades. It was meant to be a play on words, inspired by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.'s Rat Pack from the Golden Age of Hollywood. However, the young stars weren\u2019t initially a fan of the nickname. \"None of us really liked the idea of being called 'brats,' or that we weren't professionals or didn't take our work seriously,\" Moore recently told Entertainment Weekly. \"It was such an interesting, curious thing. We all had different experiences. [The Brat Pack] was very impactful for Andrew, and shifted the direction of his career.\u201d The gang recently got back together in New York City to support McCarthy, 61, at the Tribeca Film Festival where his documentary BRATS debuted at the OKX Theater at Borough of Manhattan Community College on June 7. One of the things Moore discussed in the documentary was how St. Elmo's Fire director Joel Schumacher \u201cstuck his neck out for me.\u201d \u201cThey could have easily just found someone else,\u201d she said in the film. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not like I had any box-office draw. You know, we were all just beginning. I didn\u2019t have anything to really warrant him sticking by me.\u201d In an interview ahead of the film's premiere, McCarthy told PEOPLE what he thought about being called the \u201cBrat Pack.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"It had professional ramifications,\" he said. \u201cThe public embraced us, but the business reacted to it in a negative way.\" Perhaps all is forgiven, as in Moore\u2019s Instagram post on Friday, she celebrated the St. Elmo\u2019s Fire anniversary with an interesting music selection \u2014 Charli XCX\u2019s song \u201c365,\u201d from her sixth studio album Brat.", "summary": "The actress celebrated her breakout role with inspiration from Charli XCX&#39;s new album", "url": "https://people.com/demi-moore-celebrates-st-elmo-fire-anniversary-8671563", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/xtfh8dCQH4V83ifZCaQGpykPirg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(736x236:738x238)/Demi-Moore-amfAR-Cannes-Gala-tout-052324-c489442f2ed94e69be0fc32b22628a00.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:59:00", "author": "Angel Saunders", "authors": ["Angel Saunders"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.188}

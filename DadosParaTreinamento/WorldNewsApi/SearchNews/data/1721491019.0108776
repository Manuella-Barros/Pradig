Taija Graham, 18, has been training in dance since she was a kid. In the last five years, she\u2019s taken up circus arts, training with Lyne Gosselin at Cirquetastic. \u201cI love doing trapeze and silks, and I\u2019ve got a new appreciation for doing hand-to-hand I love doing the acro part of it around festivals around Edmonton,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI love the training of it, I love the hard work, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: \"I love the training of it, I love the hard work, it's amazing.\" All that hard work is paying off. After a grueling multi-day day audition process, Graham is one of 25 performers to be accepted into the National School of Circus in Montreal. \u201cWhat better way to still be on the stage and perform and do what I love than be up in the air,\u201d said Graham. Recently, Edmonton\u2019s circus scene has seen a growth spurt. It\u2019s come a long way from 20 years ago when Firefly Theatre and Circus first opened as the only local centre to train. \u201cThat was so amazing to put circus on the map here in Edmonton,\u201d said Gosselin. The idea of a career in circus arts is also evolving. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t quite want me to go to circus because it wasn\u2019t as mainstream. You couldn\u2019t think of it as a career as you can today,\u201d Gosselin said. The success of acrobats like Graham is opening doors for the next generation. \u201cHaving Taija being able to go out east gives opportunity for other kids to dream big and want to maybe pursue the same career she has, and be like, \u2018Hey, maybe I could do this, I just need to train a little harder,\u201d Gosselin said. Firefly Theatre and Circus is now getting ready to host their 4th Alberta Circus Arts Festival. It will be one of Graham\u2019s last performances in Edmonton before leaving for circus school. For the first time, the festival is featuring Edmonton-made shows. \u201cTo see that growth come out of a circus school here in Edmonton is super exciting. We\u2019re hoping that just continues to build and people keep getting excited about contemporary circus here in Alberta,\u201d said Stephanie Gruson, co-producer of the festival. The Alberta Circus Arts Festival runs from June 20th-23rd at La Cit\u00e9 Francophone and Campus Saint-Jean.", "summary": "After a grueling multi-day day audition process, 18-year-old Taija Graham is one of 25 performers to be accepted into the National School of Circus in Montreal.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10572226/edmonton-aerial-artist-national-circus-school/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_5936.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:09:06", "author": "Jaclyn Kucey", "authors": ["Jaclyn Kucey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.559}

And Silver Ray\u2019s sister ship, Silver Nova, which came into service last year, will be cruising for the first time in Australia and New Zealand later this year and in early 2025. The two ships \u2013 known as Nova Class vessels \u2013 feature a \u2018horizontal\u2019 design which has resulted in a host of new features for the 728 passengers catered by 556 crew. \u201cThey are revolutionary ships thanks to their new design, making them the most luxurious and spacious of the Silversea fleet,\u201d said Silversea senior vice-president and managing director for Asia Pacific, Adam Radwanski. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of more space in the suites and public areas as well as being very luxurious, while the use of floor-to-ceiling glass windows results in an abundance of daylight coming inside.\u201d The design difference extends to the all-balcony suites, including a new category called Otium Suites that feature eye-catching walls of windows offering 270-degree views. \u201cThe Otium Suites are very luxurious suites located at the aft [back] covering 123 square metres, including a huge balcony complete with its own jacuzzi and a lot of living space,\u201d said Radwanski. \u201cThese are very special suites and sell out quickly.\u201d He said the new ships offer a large choice of dining experiences including The Marquee, an indoor/outdoor dining venue situated on the top deck that offers an Italian vibe. \u201c And there\u2019s S.A.L.T. Kitchen, one of our most popular dining venues where the menu is linked to informative shore excursions. \u201cAnother special experience is the S.A.L.T. Chef\u2019s Table where the chefs prepare an amazing degustation menu in front of the guests accompanied by wines and cocktails.\u201d Relax at the ship\u2019s swimming pool \u2013 the largest pool in the Silversea fleet \u2013 that is situated off-centre so that passengers taking a dip feel as if they are in an infinity pool. Silver Nova\u2019s 2024-25 season of Asia-Pacific cruises \u2013 which include Cairns to Sydney, Sydney/Melbourne to Auckland and Melbourne to Singapore \u2013 are attracting interest among Australian holidaymakers, according to Radwanski. \u201cSilver Nova is a new ship to the region and is attracting a lot of attention and bookings. Many Australians who have previously sailed with Silversea in Asia and Australia are booking on Silver Nova because it is a ground-breaking cruise ship.\u201d Among the highlights of the New Zealand cruises are exploring the famous Milford Sound, visiting Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, the Art Deco city of Napier and cosmopolitan Auckland. \u201cThis year Silversea is celebrating 30 years of service as one of the world\u2019s best luxury cruise lines and our focus now is to become an experiential travel company to deliver the best luxury holidays,\u201d said Radwanski.

They sure did know exactly how to hurt me today but this too, shall pass.\u201d She added, \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this over & over & over & over & over again & I\u2019ve tried so hard to not discuss it b/c [because] you guys deserve to just get the good stuff. I hate involving you in anything that isn\u2019t for entertainment purposes only.\u201d A rescheduled date for Saturday\u2019s show has not yet been announced, however Minaj will return to Manchester Thursday for another previously scheduled gig in the city. Minaj will perform in Birmingham, England on Sunday night. \u201cWe will have another date for tonight\u2019s show shortly & I\u2019ll probably be able to share it tmrw. One July option & one June option is currently being discussed,\u201d Minaj wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to not only make up the date with the performance but I\u2019m going to create an added bonus for everyone that had a tkt for this show.

{"id": 243211402, "title": "Where does Gavin Williams fit in starting rotation? Guardians takeaways", "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A decision four months in the making is drawing near. Gavin Williams, unless something unexpected happens, should be joining the Guardians\u2019 starting rotation nextweek. He made his sixth rehab start Thursday for Class AAA Columbus. He lasted just four innings, but threw 82 pitches while striking out six and allowing one run against Omaha. \u201cHe made it through 80 something pitches,\u201d said manager Stephen Vogt on Friday. \u201cWe have a decision to make in the next few days. We\u2019re still sorting through what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Pitchers can go on a rehab assignment for 30 days. After that a decision on their status has to be made. Williams\u2019 30 days are nearing an end. Williams was expected to open the season in the rotation after making his big league debut last year. But the team\u2019s No.1 pick in 2021 injured his right elbow after two spring training starts. He\u2019s been trying to come back ever since. The Guardians have options when it comes to picking a course of action. That\u2019s because the rotation has not been as good as in years past. They could activate Williams from the injured list and option him to Columbus, but that seems unlikely. The more likely choice is that he\u2019ll replace one of the current starters, who have combined to pitch the fewest inning in the American League. It will not be an easy decision. Triston McKenzie made his 16th start Friday against the Royals. He has a 7.27 ERA in his last six starts. Overall, McKenzie has allowed 46 walks and 17 homers. The walks are tied for the most by an pitcher in the big leagues. The 17 homers are tied for third. Lefty Logan Allen (8-3, 5.72) has a good record, but he\u2019s been inconsistent. He\u2019s tied for the MLB lead in homers allowed with 18. Carlos Carrasco (3-6, 5.27) was on the bubble for the first two months of the season, but his last two starts have been promising. Tanner Bibee (6-2, 3.50) and Ben Lively (7-4, 3.03) have been the cornerstones of the staff. It would be a shock if they would be involved in this conversation. McKenzie, who missed much of last season with a strained UCL in his right elbow, has struggled to regain his 2022 form. He had a 2.96 ERA over 31 games, including 30 starts, in 191 1/3 innings that season. He could have undergone Tommy John surgery on his right elbow last year, but chose a non-surgical path. \u201cWhen Triston has had good outings, he\u2019s been in the strike zone,\u201d said Vogt. \u201cWhen he\u2019s struggled, it\u2019s been inconsistent command, getting into bad counts. You give a major league hitter a 2-0 and 3-1 count, they\u2019re going to win move often than not. \u201cWhen Triston is attacking the strike zone, he\u2019s got elite stuff and it\u2019s tough to square him up.\u201d Pain in the rib One foul ball put Will Brennan on the injured list just when he was swinging the bat as well as he has this year. \u201cIt stinks,\u201d said Brennan. Monday night, in a 3-2 win over the Orioles at Camden Yards, Brennan went to the plate in the eighth inning after going 1 for 3. He fouled a pitch off before striking out and felt something in his left rib cage. He was placed on 10-day injured list on Thursday. Friday was his last day of complete rest. Saturday he\u2019ll be able to start limited baseball activities. \u201cI\u2019m look forward to Saturday,\u201d said Brennan. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking forward to tonight (Friday) and watching the boys play. I\u2019m going to be the best cheerleader I can be.\u201d Brennan is hitting .327 (18 for 55) with three homers and five RBI in June. He simplified his swing and believes he\u2019ll be able to recapture it when he\u2019s ready to be activated. Fire down below Kyle Manzardo, Angel Martinez and George Valera homered Thursday as Columbus beat Omaha, 8-3. Manzardo hit a three-run homer in the first and Valera a three-run homer in the fifth. . .Dayan Frias drove in four runs, but Class AA Akron lost to Altoona, 6-4. Tommy Mace (6-3, 3.31) took the loss, allowing five runs on nine hits in 4 2/3 innings. . .Jonah Advincula and Jorge Burgos homered and drove in three runs each as Class A Lake County beat Great Lakes, 13-3. Rorik Maltrud (1-0, 1.80) allowed one run on four hits with five strikeouts in five innings. . .Class A Lynchburg scored two runs in the sixth inning to beat Carolina, 5-4. Esteban Gonzalez went 3 for 5 with a double, triple and three RBI. Tommy Hawke went 2 for 4 with an RBI. Jackson Humphries started and allowed one earned run over 3 1/3 innings. Finally David Fry, limited to DH duties because of a sore right elbow, did some throwing before Friday\u2019s game. . .The Guardians have turned 52 double plays since May 1 to lead the big leagues in that span.", "summary": "Manager Stephen Vogt said the staff is mulling over what move to make when Gavin Williams is activated from the injured list.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/guardians/2024/06/where-does-gavin-williams-fit-in-starting-rotation-guardians-takeaways.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/JHYEMMWB25HV7MEKHOIXT656SM.jpg?auth=ed4338c67fa908d47f38f279312ff929c7588623d909d580be2307ba6cb1b0bd&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:05:24", "author": "Paul Hoynes", "authors": ["Paul Hoynes"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.182}

{"id": 225054538, "title": "If Fifa is about to make an EA Sports FC competitor, that\u2019s great news for gamers", "text": "Two years ago, the long and lucrative relationship between Electronic Arts and Fifa broke down, with EA taking its ball home and launching EA Sports FC, a new brand for its footie sim series. Fifa president Gianni Infantino made a sulky declaration that he would find a new developer and that, \u201cthe only authentic, real game that has the Fifa name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans\u201d. This seemed like a ludicrous boast: EA had 20 years of experience making mainstream football sims \u2013 an expensive and highly sophisticated endeavour. How could Fifa hope to find a studio capable of competing? Well, it looks as if the global football body may have found its new best friend. Gaming news sites have been reporting on a tweet by Ghanaian retailer MohPlay, claiming that a deal had been struck with 2K Games to make a new Fifa title \u2013 perhaps even for release later this year. The tweet, which has had over 200,000 views, seems to confirm an earlier rumour about a partnership between Fifa and 2K. In some ways, it makes sense. Although the American publisher has not developed a modern soccer sim, it has a lot of experience with sports games, via its NBA 2K, NFL 2K, WWE 2K, TopSpin 2K and PGA Tour 2K titles. Furthermore, the latter license was eventually purchased by 2K several years after EA ended its PGA relationship \u2013 so the company has form in this area. But a new Fifa game this year? That seems unlikely. Even if 2K had begun work as soon as the relationship between EA and Fifa dissolved in May 2022, that was still gave them barely two years to assemble a team, develop the game and create digital likenesses (which would surely include motion capture) of hundreds of players, as well as modelling the stadia. The reaction from players has been mixed. Many welcome the idea of competition for the EA series now that Konami\u2019s Pro Evolution Soccer brand is a shadow of its former self. But 2K games has been criticised for overt monetisation within its games especially the NBA series, where players can use real money to buy players for the MyCareer mode. I\u2019d love to see a strong new independent competitor \u2013 something with the knockabout thrills of 2D titles such as Sensible Soccer or Kick Off 2, or a game that recalls the early 3D era of International Super Star Soccer or Virtua Striker. We do have Sociable Soccer, the spiritual successor to the Sensible series, but it would be great to have something completely new; something fun and fast and eccentric. We\u2019ve seen the introduction of idiosyncratic concepts into the golf sim arena with What the Golf and Desert Golfing \u2013 surely it\u2019s football\u2019s turn? Could we perhaps resurrect the idea of semi-turn-based footie games suggested by ZX Spectrum classic Subbuteo? Or maybe bring back the era of football games that were licensed by a single (often retired) pro? We\u2019re long overdue a successor to Chris Kamara\u2019s Street Soccer or Emlyn Hughes International Soccer. Forget the multimillion-dollar tournament licenses and endless micro-transactions \u2013 shall we never again see the likes of Peter Shilton\u2019s Handball Maradona? What to play If you rightly miss the glory days of humour-tinged resource management games, then Galacticare by Brightrock Games will give you lots of nostalgic pleasure during the summer months.

Available on: PC, PS5, XboxEstimated playtime: 30+ hours What to read Helldivers 2 is one of the biggest hits of the year, and GamesIndustry.Biz has an interesting interview with its creator, Arrowhead Games. One of the key difficulties the company faces is how to deal with the problems that huge success brings \u2013 including the health of its staff. \u201cThe big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community,\u201d explains CEO Johan Pilestedt. They\u2019re certainly not alone. Another interview that caught a lot of attention this week was with Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann, who appeared to tell the Sony website that his next project would \u201credefine mainstream perceptions of gaming\u201d. He was forced to correct the record, as he was apparently misquoted. Activision has confirmed that this year\u2019s Call of Duty title will be Black Ops 6 \u2013 more details will be revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase on 9 June, with a deep dive stream following afterwards. I\u2019m reading Playing With Reality: How Games Shape Our World by neuroscientist Kelly Clancy. It\u2019s a fascinating, far-reaching study of the role played by games throughout the history of humanity, from the forgotten medieval game of rithmomachia to modern simulations and online worlds. It\u2019s published on 18 June. What to click Question Block This question comes from reader Ali, who wrote: \u201cWe often hear about how the video games industry is bigger than the film and music industries, but is often not given the same treatment as those more mainstream industries. However, isn\u2019t it only a bigger industry because the unit costs per video game is often much higher than the unit costs per film or music album? For example, if one million people buy GTA VI for \u00a360 next year, that generates \u00a360m in revenue, but if one million people watch Oppenheimer for \u00a315 per ticket or buy the latest Taylor Swift album for \u00a315, that would generate \u00a315m. And as a video games journalist, do you attach any value to reports about how the video games industry is bigger than the film and music industries?\u201d Although there\u2019s some truth in this, there are a few flaws in your maths. First, for every video game sold, there could be a whole family or friend group playing, so in a fiscal sense, each copy is working extremely hard for that \u00a360m. Also, don\u2019t overlook the huge boom in free-to-play smartphone games, such as Candy Crush or Genshin Impact \u2013 according to a range of statistical estimates, there are around 2.5 billion smartphone gamers in the world, many of whom never pay a penny, and certainly not \u00a360. I have grown to despise how non-specialist news and media outlets refer to global revenue figures every time games are mentioned \u2013 something they don\u2019t do with films or music on anywhere near the same regularity. It\u2019s a hopelessly narrow lens through which to view such a bewilderingly diverse art form, and it reduces the cultural value of games to a few money-spinning franchises. I really hope, by the time GTA VI does arrive, that news and arts programmes will find more interesting angles than how much money it\u2019s made for stakeholders.

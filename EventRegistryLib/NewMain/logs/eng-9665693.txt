ACU was selected to oversee the involvement of university students from across Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.\n\nTwelve students from the region have been selected to speak to Pope Francis about an issue that concerned the smaller group during the virtual meeting.\n\nElizabeth Fernandez, who is studying business admin and law at Macquarie University in Sydney, and Seamus Lohrey, a law and public relations student from the University of Waikato, will represent young people from Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.\n\nElizabeth, who comes from a strong Catholic family of 11, said her group agreed that loneliness and isolation, and a lack of faith formation, were big issues facing young Catholics today.\n\n\"When I first started university, I was very lonely because I'd come from a very Catholic high school, but all my friends had gone to different unis,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's really built my courage to say something and to also really educate myself on my faith and how and what I stand for.\"\n\nDuring her dialogue with Pope Francis, Elizabeth also hopes to ask the Holy Father for a special blessing for her mum.\n\n\"A couple of days after I found out about the project, mum was diagnosed with cancer,\" Elizabeth said, noting her entire family, including her grandfather from New Zealand, will be beside her during the virtual meeting with the Pope.\n\n\"But she's also very excited about (me meeting the Pope). This has been a good moment of joy in the journey.\"\n\nSeamus, who is originally from a small town in the North Canterbury region of the South Island, New Zealand, hopes to talk to the Pope about human dignity.\n\n\"I think a prominent issue is the Catholic Church not treating vulnerable people in our societies with the respect and dignity they deserve,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a bit of a controversial one with some people, but rocking the boat is the only way to go I think with things like this. I'm not out here to criticise for the sake of it, but because I think that positive change could be made, and I think Pope Francis is an incredibly attentive and a respectful listener and I think he'd be very open to what I have to talk about.\"\n\nAs a baptised Catholic, Seamus admits to battling with his faith at different times in his life.\n\n\"I felt my faith being strongest later in life during high school, when I found myself in positions of leadership, and I think that was God trying to make sure there's a solid character of faith talking to people,\" he said.\n\nAhead of the meeting with Pope Francis, Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a, Prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, sent a brief greeting to the participating university students.\n\nIn his letter, he reminded the students that as well as being called to build bridges, \"with this meeting, you have now been called to become bridges\".\n\n\"Being a bridge is practicing the commandment of love, which Jesus taught us, at any time and in any place, even know that, many times, some will use our service or charity without mentioning us,\" Cardinal Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a said.\n\nThursday's virtual meeting will be livestreamed on YouTube at 2pm Rome time/10pm AEST/June 21 12am NZST. The university students will also be given a brief opportunity to meet and take a virtual photo with Pope Francis at the end of the livestream.\n\nACU's Associate Director of Mission and Ministry, Mark Doyle, said the dialogue between the university students had been \"robust, thoughtful, and insightful\".\n\n\"The students spoke extremely passionately about various complex issues, and it was clear that they are committed to making the world a better place,\" Mr Doyle said.\n\n\"Both Seamus and Elizabeth are excited to present their ideas to the Pope and to hear his insight about their concerns.\"\n\nThe virtual dialogue with students from the Asia-Pacific comes months out from Pope Francis' expectant visit to the region in September. The Vatican announced in April that Pope Francis would make an Apostolic Journey to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Singapore in early September.\n\nThe Building Bridges Initiative has facilitated encounters between Pope Francis and students from the Americas, Africa, and South Asia.\n\nFor more information, visit the Building Bridges Initiative website, or watch the livestream on July 20 10pm AEST here.\n\nBackground on the Building Bridges Initiative:\n\nInspired by the call of Pope Francis to synodality, Loyola University Chicago launched the Building Bridges Initiative to be a student-centred and university-organised series of events.\n\nThe initial event in February 2022, Building Bridges North-South, emerged organically from a collaboration between Loyola and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.\n\nThe initiative aims to facilitate the student groups across large geographic regions, and with support from university partners, accompany students as they engage in listening, dialogue, and discernment around shared social concerns. Student representatives of those groups are invited to a livestreamed dialogue with Pope Francis where they are encouraged to share their group's experiences and hopes.\n\nParticipants of the Building Bridges Initiative from Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea includes students at ACU, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Queensland, Queensland University of Technology, RMIT, Victoria University, the Catholic Theological College, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales, University of Technology Sydney, Macquarie University, the University of Waikato in Hamilton, NZ, University of Auckland, NZ, and Divine Word University, PNG.\n\nAs well as ACU, other partner universities include Ateneo de Manila University, Manila, Philippines, Universitas Sanata Dharma, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea, and Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType":

ACU was selected to oversee the involvement of university students from across Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.\n\nTwelve students from the region have been selected to speak to Pope Francis about an issue that concerned the smaller group during the virtual meeting.\n\nElizabeth Fernandez, who is studying business admin and law at Macquarie University in Sydney, and Seamus Lohrey, a law and public relations student from the University of Waikato, will represent young people from Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.\n\nElizabeth, who comes from a strong Catholic family of 11, said her group agreed that loneliness and isolation, and a lack of faith formation, were big issues facing young Catholics today.\n\n\"When I first started university, I was very lonely because I'd come from a very Catholic high school, but all my friends had gone to different unis,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's really built my courage to say something and to also really educate myself on my faith and how and what I stand for.\"\n\nDuring her dialogue with Pope Francis, Elizabeth also hopes to ask the Holy Father for a special blessing for her mum.\n\n\"A couple of days after I found out about the project, mum was diagnosed with cancer,\" Elizabeth said, noting her entire family, including her grandfather from New Zealand, will be beside her during the virtual meeting with the Pope.\n\n\"But she's also very excited about (me meeting the Pope). This has been a good moment of joy in the journey.\"\n\nSeamus, who is originally from a small town in the North Canterbury region of the South Island, New Zealand, hopes to talk to the Pope about human dignity.\n\n\"I think a prominent issue is the Catholic Church not treating vulnerable people in our societies with the respect and dignity they deserve,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a bit of a controversial one with some people, but rocking the boat is the only way to go I think with things like this. I'm not out here to criticise for the sake of it, but because I think that positive change could be made, and I think Pope Francis is an incredibly attentive and a respectful listener and I think he'd be very open to what I have to talk about.\"\n\nAs a baptised Catholic, Seamus admits to battling with his faith at different times in his life.\n\n\"I felt my faith being strongest later in life during high school, when I found myself in positions of leadership, and I think that was God trying to make sure there's a solid character of faith talking to people,\" he said.\n\nAhead of the meeting with Pope Francis, Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a, Prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, sent a brief greeting to the participating university students.\n\nIn his letter, he reminded the students that as well as being called to build bridges, \"with this meeting, you have now been called to become bridges\".\n\n\"Being a bridge is practicing the commandment of love, which Jesus taught us, at any time and in any place, even know that, many times, some will use our service or charity without mentioning us,\" Cardinal Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a said.\n\nThursday's virtual meeting will be livestreamed on YouTube at 2pm Rome time/10pm AEST/June 21 12am NZST. The university students will also be given a brief opportunity to meet and take a virtual photo with Pope Francis at the end of the livestream.\n\nACU's Associate Director of Mission and Ministry, Mark Doyle, said the dialogue between the university students had been \"robust, thoughtful, and insightful\".\n\n\"The students spoke extremely passionately about various complex issues, and it was clear that they are committed to making the world a better place,\" Mr Doyle said.\n\n\"Both Seamus and Elizabeth are excited to present their ideas to the Pope and to hear his insight about their concerns.\"\n\nThe virtual dialogue with students from the Asia-Pacific comes months out from Pope Francis' expectant visit to the region in September. The Vatican announced in April that Pope Francis would make an Apostolic Journey to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Singapore in early September.\n\nThe Building Bridges Initiative has facilitated encounters between Pope Francis and students from the Americas, Africa, and South Asia.\n\nInspired by the call of Pope Francis to synodality, Loyola University Chicago launched the Building Bridges Initiative to be a student-centred and university-organised series of events.\n\nThe initial event in February 2022, Building Bridges North-South, emerged organically from a collaboration between Loyola and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.\n\nThe initiative aims to facilitate the student groups across large geographic regions, and with support from university partners, accompany students as they engage in listening, dialogue, and discernment around shared social concerns. Student representatives of those groups are invited to a livestreamed dialogue with Pope Francis where they are encouraged to share their group's experiences and hopes.\n\nParticipants of the Building Bridges Initiative from Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea includes students at ACU, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Queensland, Queensland University of Technology, RMIT, Victoria University, the Catholic Theological College, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales, University of Technology Sydney, Macquarie University, the University of Waikato in Hamilton, NZ, University of Auckland, NZ, and Divine Word University, PNG.\n\nAs well as ACU, other partner universities include Ateneo de Manila University, Manila, Philippines, Universitas Sanata Dharma, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea, and Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan", "source": {"uri": "pacific.scoop.co.nz",

Students also participated from Singapore, Timor Leste, and Papua New Guinea, nations the Holy Father is set to visit during his Apostolic Journey to Asia and Oceania in September.\n\nPope Francis joined the encounter, warmly greeting those present in Spanish, and apologizing for running a little late due to some confusion on its timing on his agenda.\n\nThe student groups were introduced to the Pope, where they offered reflections, to which the Holy Father offered his advice, concerns, and suggestions.\n\nThe Holy Father spoke to the first group about feeling a sense of belonging to society, and how our 'belonging' heightens our security in ourselves and our own human dignity.\n\nAll these factors, he noted, \"saves us from vulnerability, because today youth are very vulnerable. We must always defend this sense of belonging in order to ward off vulnerability.\n\n\"Look at where you are most vulnerable, and ask someone to help you,\" he said, to counter where you are most susceptible.\n\nThe Pope also discussed mental health, discrimination, stigmas, and identity, and called for bear witness and carrying on.\n\n\"Focus on having your own identity,\" he said, as he encouraged all to always stay united with and cooperated with others.\n\nThe Pope decried all stigmas that belittle one's human dignity. He lamented that women at times are considered second class citizens, which he stressed is not true.\n\n\"The greatness of women must not be forgotten. He aid women are better than men in terms of their insight and their ability to build communities,\" he said, as he commended special qualities and competencies unique to women.\n\nThe Pope called on students to show closeness and love to others, and to never exclude.\n\nRecalling a student's words on gender, which mentioned a high HIV rate in the Philippines, the Pope said, \"We must make sure that healthcare is prepared to treat and help all people, without exclusion.\"\n\nThe Pope also discussed effective education, which, in his opinion, requires \"educating\" and \"coordinating\" our \"hearts, minds, and hands.\"\n\nThis is how we should educate youth, he said, noting this dynamic must never be forgotten.\n\nThe Pope acknowledged how challenging it can be for young Christians people to participate and 'belong' in society.\n\nGiven this, he urged them to cling to their faith, and to keep their heart connected to prayer.\n\nDoing so, the Pope encouraged, will help in this regard and enable them to always more effectively engage with others.\n\nThe Holy Father addressed when young people are mocked or challenged for their faith.\n\n\"Always be firmly convinced of your own convictions,\" he advised, while warning against becoming isolated which can lead to poor habits and problems.\n\nGiven this, the Pope underscored, it is particularly important to be educated in the faith, and to be authentic and 'real' Christians.\n\n\"The thing is this: Christians have been being persecuted from the beginning,\" he said, highlighting this phenomenon is nothing new.\n\n\"While it can be tempting to have a diluted, lukewarm Christianity,\" the Pope said, we cannot give in to it. Rather, he appealed, \"we must be solid, and must live a sort of martyrdom, in this sense.\"\n\nThe Pope called for greater awareness of tragedies of past, to learn lessons for the future, to work toward peace.\n\n\"Ideology is a disease,\" he said, as he urged all people to build harmony and promote a dialogue with other cultures.\n\n\"No to war,\" he said, calling for peacefulness. \"In a desperate, hopeless world, we must appeal to our values,\" he said, as he called on them to work on this and thanked them for his efforts.\n\nPope Francis concluded by thanking the students for their reflections, saying it helped him to understand them, also ahead of his trip in their region in early September, before he offered his blessing.\n\nVarious Vatican offices assisted in the initiative, including the General Secretariat of the Synod, the Dicastery for Communication, the Dicastery for the Laity, Family, and Life, the Dicastery for Education and Culture and the Dicastery for Evangelization's Section for the first evangelization and new particular Churches.\n\nPrior to the Holy Father's joining the dialogue, the event had begun with introductions by the organizers, including by Secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, Dr. Emilce Cuda, and video messages from Cardinal Farrell, the Prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Laity, Family Life, followed by that of Bishop Luis Mar\u00edn de San Mart\u00edn, O.S.A.. Under Secretary of the Synod of Bishops.\n\nCardinal Farrell called on students to follow Jesus' example of building bridges, and reminded that while they live the privileged reality of being a university student, there is a world marked by hatred, war, and suffering. Given this, he invited those following to practice kindness, care, and understanding on a personal level, first and foremost, because otherwise, he lamented, we cannot expect those on higher levels to do the same.\n\nBishop Mar\u00edn offered encourage words that amid a time of hope and renewal, we are called to \"create bonds, break down walls, and build bridges.\" While the participants anticipated the Pope's arrival, Dr. Cuda also read the letter from the Prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Culture and Education, Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a, in which he acknowledged that building bridges can be challenging, and can be met with struggle and resistance, but is always worth it, because it lives out the love that Jesus taught us.", "source": {"uri":

Like the Philippine establishment, many of these institutes of higher learning are run by the Jesuit order.\n\nThe Building Bridges Initiative is behind tomorrow's meeting, which can be followed online here.\n\nAbout 9 per cent of the world's Christians live in the geographically wide and religiously diverse Asia-Pacific, a region where Christians range from a small minority (1 per cent in Thailand and Japan) to a majority in a few countries like the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, 85 per cent and 97 per cent respectively.\n\nThe uneven distribution of the Christian population and the religion professed in such a varied regional framework contribute to making the faith experiences of young people incredibly diverse.\n\nProfessors are assisting students in 12 working groups, working with university partners in the Asia-Pacific region, from different countries: Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines.\n\nStudents are enrolled in a variety of programmes such as computer science, chemistry, philosophy, theology, psychology, economics, physics, and law.\n\nFive students from five different Jesuit-run universities - in Manila, Naga, Davao, Zamboanga, and Cagayan de Oro - discussed topics and issues concerning spirituality and social issues ahead of tomorrow's virtual t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the pope.\n\nThe meeting is part of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) undertaken by the Jesuit-run Loyola University Chicago (LUC) in cooperation with the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and the Vatican Dicastery for Culture and Education, which drew inspiration from Pope Francis's call for \"synodality\".\n\nIn a message addressed to the students on the eve of the meeting, Card Jos\u00e9 Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a, Prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, said that their presence and role is to build bridges, a reference to the very name of the initiative.\n\nIn view of tomorrow's event and looking at the philosophy that inspires it, young people must increasingly be an element of dialogue, of mutual knowledge, bringing together realities that are apparently distant and different from each other.\n\nEither \"face-to-face or virtual meetings are precious moments to build bridge - when they do not yet exist - or to reinforce bridges - when, existing, the need to strengthen them is felt,\" the prelate said.\n\nThis meeting with the Pope is to \"become a bridge. I consider this to be the most important thing and the most difficult,\" Card de Mendon\u00e7a explained.\n\n\"Being available to others requires overcoming self-referentiality, measuring excessive communication through social networks, welcoming the brother at our side, and opening the horizon,\" he added.\n\n\"I finally invite you, young people, to experience the joy of building bridges here and now, especially in places where Christ and his message are still virtually unknown,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asia News.it"}, "authors": [],

Don't take my word for it, judge this tree by it's fruits ...\n\nJoe Hoft of The Gateway Pundit reports:\n\nPope Francis says that the world and its institutions require material changes to create a new economic system that creates food, health, economic and social rights for all.\n\nSocialism hasn't destroyed enough and so Pope Francis is calling for what seems to be socialism around the world.\n\nNewsmax reported this morning on Pope Francis's recent comments.\n\nPope Francis said the need to reform the United Nations was \"more than obvious\" after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war exposed its limits, in an extract of his new book published Sunday.\n\nThe Argentine pontiff said Russia's February invasion of Ukraine highlighted the need to ensure the current multilateral structure -- especially the UN Security Council -- finds \"more agile and effective ways of resolving conflicts\".\n\n\"In wartime, it is essential to affirm that we need more multilateralism and a better multilateralism,\" but the UN is no longer fit for \"new realities\", he added in an extract published by La Stampa daily.\n\nThe organisation was founded to prevent the horrors of two World Wars from happening again, but although the threat represented by those conflicts was still alive, \"today's world is no longer the same\", said Francis.\n\n\"The necessity of these reforms became more than obvious after the pandemic\" when the current multilateral system \"showed all its limits\", he added.\n\nFrancis denounced the unequal distribution of vaccines as a \"glaring example\" of the law of the strongest prevailing over solidarity.\n\nAn individual by the name of Hans Despain reported this morning at Yahoo on the Pope's recent actions. Despain praises the Pope's latest actions.\n\nPope Francis has become the eminent voice of the economically destitute and the environment. Since being elected to the papacy Pope Francis insists that we need a new economic system that better provides basic needs for the global poor, along with guaranteed work and land.\n\nRegarding the environment, Pope Francis contends we \"must not be indifferent or resigned to the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of ecosystems, often caused by our irresponsible and selfish behavior.\"\n\nHe warns: \"Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence. ... We have no such right.\"\n\nFor Pope Francis, economic destitution and environmental destruction are symbiotically linked. \"Climate change is,\" according to Pope Francis, displacing people, increasing poverty and \"contributing to the heart-rending refugee crisis.

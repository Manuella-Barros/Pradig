Trump is calling out her past positions and statements at his rallies, and on Monday his campaign began reserving time for television advertisements that are likely to resurface videos of Ms. Harris.\n\n\"The archive is deep,\" said Brad Todd, a Republican strategist and ad maker who is working with David McCormick, the G.O.P. Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, among other campaigns. \"We will run out of time before we run out of video clips of Kamala Harris saying wacky California liberal things. I'm just not sure that the rest of this campaign includes much besides that.\"\n\nThe first television ads to attack Ms. Harris for her past statements came not from Mr. Trump's campaign but from Mr. McCormick, who is challenging Senator Bob Casey.\n\nThe 60-second ad, which Mr. McCormick's campaign began airing Monday, resurfaces a laundry list of statements Ms. Harris made in 2019 and 2020.\n\nShe said then that she opposed fracking; would \"think about\" abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency; called the idea of adding more police officers \"wrongheaded thinking\"; entertained the idea of allowing felons to vote; said she supported a \"mandatory buyback program\" for some guns; and called for the elimination of private health insurance.\n\nFracking is a particularly tough issue for Ms. Harris. Banning it was a plank in her energy platform in the 2020 primary race. But fracking remains a key element of the economy in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most important battleground state this year.\n\n\"She pledged to ban fracking -- no fracking, oh, that's going to do well in Pennsylvania, isn't it?\" Mr. Trump said at a rally on Saturday in Minnesota. \"Remember, Pennsylvania, I said it. She wants no fracking. She's on tape. The beautiful thing about modern technology is when you say something, you're screwed if it's bad.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign announced on Friday that the vice president no longer wanted to ban fracking, a significant shift from where she stood four years ago but one that is consistent with the policies of President Biden's administration.\n\nThe Harris campaign will rebut most of Republicans' attacks by arguing that they are exaggerating or lying about her record, said a campaign official briefed on the plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Her campaign plans to lean into her record as a local prosecutor and state attorney general to burnish her image as a candidate with deep ties to law enforcement.\n\nIn addition to changing her position on fracking, campaign officials said she now backed the Biden administration's budget requests for increased funding for border enforcement; no longer supported a single-payer health insurance program; and echoed Mr. Biden's call for banning assault weapons but not a requirement to sell them to the federal government.\n\n\"Kamala Harris spent 20 years as a tough-as-nails prosecutor who sent violent criminals to prison,\" said Brian Fallon, a Harris campaign spokesman. \"Her years spent in law enforcement and her record in the Biden-Harris administration defy Trump's attempts to define her through lies.\"\n\nOn Monday, as Mr. Biden prepared a speech in Texas calling for term limits and ethics guidelines for Supreme Court justices, the Trump campaign resurfaced statements Ms. Harris made in 2019 saying she was \"open to this conversation\" about expanding the Supreme Court. Ms. Harris, in a statement released by her campaign, endorsed Mr. Biden's proposal, which does not call for adding additional justices to the court.\n\nOfficials with Ms. Harris's campaign also said they hoped to utilize the liberal cultural fervor around her candidacy to make the election a referendum on the future versus a past Democrats argue Mr. Trump represents.\n\nMr. Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, have themselves been on multiple sides of many issues, not least of which is Mr. Vance's past stance as a prominent critic of Mr. Trump.\n\nThere is ample video of Mr. Trump making remarks unhelpful to his 2024 campaign. In 2016, he said women who sought abortions should face punishment, and as president he tried to bar immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries and enacted a policy of separating immigrant children from their families at the southern border. He also was caught on tape bragging about groping women.\n\nMatt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank, said he was not worried that Ms. Harris had once espoused left-wing ideas. She has evolved, he said, into a Biden-style Democrat with more centrist views.\n\n\"There's a tremendous difference in changing one's policy ideas and changing one's principles,\" Mr. Bennett said. \"She has not changed her principles. She still thinks climate change is an existential threat -- she just doesn't think the Green New Deal is the way to address it.\"\n\nSince she joined Mr. Biden's ticket in 2020, Ms. Harris has seldom put forward policies that differ much from his. She is no longer pushing for a single-payer health care system, and on Friday her campaign said she would maintain Mr. Biden's pledge not to raise income taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year.\n\nBut one issue on which Ms. Harris has already put some daylight between herself and Mr. Biden is abortion rights. Since the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the president has said he would sign legislation restoring a federal right to abortion if such a bill came to his desk.\n\nIn her early speeches as a presidential candidate, Ms. Harris has offered to go a bit further.\n\n\"When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,\" she told an audience in Wisconsin last week, using a broader term that suggested such legislation could extend beyond abortion rights to things like protecting in vitro fertilization or contraception.\n\nDuring her 2020 presidential campaign, Ms. Harris had an even bolder plan on abortion rights. Her proposal would have required states and local jurisdictions that tried to restrict abortion rights to obtain federal approval before a new law could take effect -- similar to the way that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 limited changes to voting laws in some states with a history of racial discrimination.\n\n\"On this issue, I'm kind of done,\" she said of abortion rights during a 2019 interview on MSNBC. \"When elected, I'm going to put in place and require that states that have a history of passing legislation that is designed to prevent or limit a woman's access to reproductive health care, that those laws have to come before my Department of Justice for a review and approval. And until we determine that they are constitutional, they will not take effect.\"\n\nBy 2023, Ms. Harris's position on abortion rights had evolved to echoing Mr. Biden's call to enact legislation codifying a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"We need to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" Ms. Harris said during a 2023 interview on CBS. \"We're not trying to do anything that did not exist before June of last year.\"\n\nThat remains her position, said Lauren Hitt, a campaign spokeswoman.\n\nMs. Harris's first presidential campaign was undone in part by staff turmoil that resulted in public finger-pointing and scathing resignation letters even before she dropped out of the race. Former aides interviewed for this article, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their current employers, said Ms. Harris's campaign had been undermined by a combination of unsteady leadership from its senior staff members and too much influence on the candidate from her family members.\n\nBut during that race, Ms. Harris also often appeared as if she were not sure what she believed. In a CNN town-hall event the day after what was widely viewed as a successful campaign rollout in Oakland, Calif., she appeared tentative while discussing health care policy, eventually saying she would eliminate private health insurance and institute a single-payer health care program.\n\nShe would go on to propose an array of policies popular with progressives. She sought to increase pay for public-school teachers by an average of $13,500 through a bump in the estate tax.\n\nShe also called for an assault weapons ban and said she would sign an executive order mandating background checks for customers of any dealer who sold more than five guns in a year. And she sought to close the gender pay gap by requiring large companies to certify that men and women were paid equally.\n\nBut for all her liberal policy proposals in the 2020 campaign, Ms. Harris was frequently viewed through her biography. She leaned into her record as a former prosecutor and California attorney general, but many voters were well aware of her status as a Black and South Asian woman who had marched with her immigrant mother in civil rights demonstrations in California.\n\n\"I don't know that the policy stuff is what people were talking about -- it was all biography,\" said Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic Party chairwoman who backed Ms. Harris in the 2020 campaign. \"She's always been complex policy-wise, but I think people look at her and expect a thing. She's going to talk about law and order and being a prosecutor.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Harris, in a statement released by her campaign, endorsed Biden's proposal, which does not call for adding additional justices to the court.\n\nOfficials with Harris' campaign also said they hoped to use the liberal cultural fervor around her candidacy to make the election a referendum on the future versus a past Democrats argue Trump represents.\n\nTrump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, have themselves been on multiple sides of many issues, not least of which is Vance's past stance as a prominent critic of Trump.\n\nThere is ample video of Trump making remarks unhelpful to his 2024 campaign. In 2016, he said women who sought abortions should face punishment, and as president he tried to bar immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries and enacted a policy of separating immigrant children from their families at the southern border. He also was caught on tape bragging about groping women.\n\nMatt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank, said he was not worried that Harris had once espoused left-wing ideas. She has evolved, he said, into a Biden-style Democrat with more centrist views.\n\n\"There's a tremendous difference in changing one's policy ideas and changing one's principles,\" Bennett said. \"She has not changed her principles. She still thinks climate change is an existential threat -- she just doesn't think the Green New Deal is the way to address it.\"\n\nSince she joined Biden's ticket in 2020, Harris has seldom put forward policies that differ much from his. She is no longer pushing for a single-payer health care system, and on Friday her campaign said she would maintain Biden's pledge not to raise income taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year.\n\nBut one issue on which Harris has already put some daylight between herself and Biden is abortion rights. Since the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the president has said he would sign legislation restoring a federal right to abortion if such a bill came to his desk.\n\nIn her early speeches as a presidential candidate, Harris has offered to go a bit further.\n\n\"When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,\" she told an audience in Wisconsin last week, using a broader term that suggested such legislation could extend beyond abortion rights to things like protecting in vitro fertilization or contraception.\n\nDuring her 2020 presidential campaign, Harris had an even bolder plan on abortion rights. Her proposal would have required states and local jurisdictions that tried to restrict abortion rights to obtain federal approval before a new law could take effect -- similar to the way that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 limited changes to voting laws in some states with a history of racial discrimination.\n\n\"On this issue, I'm kind of done,\" she said of abortion rights during a 2019 interview on MSNBC. \"When elected, I'm going to put in place and require that states that have a history of passing legislation that is designed to prevent or limit a woman's access to reproductive health care, that those laws have to come before my Department of Justice for a review and approval. And until we determine that they are constitutional, they will not take effect.\"\n\nBy 2023, Harris' position on abortion rights had evolved to echoing Biden's call to enact legislation codifying a federal right to abortion.\n\n\"We need to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" Harris said during a 2023 interview on CBS. \"We're not trying to do anything that did not exist before June of last year.\"\n\nThat remains her position, said Lauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson.\n\nHarris' first presidential campaign was undone in part by staff turmoil that resulted in public finger-pointing and scathing resignation letters even before she dropped out of the race. Former aides interviewed for this article, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their current employers, said Harris' campaign had been undermined by a combination of unsteady leadership from its senior staff members and too much influence on the candidate from her family members.\n\nBut during that race, Harris also often appeared as if she were not sure what she believed. In a CNN town-hall event the day after what was widely viewed as a successful campaign rollout in Oakland, California, she appeared tentative while discussing health care policy, eventually saying she would eliminate private health insurance and institute a single-payer health care program.\n\nShe would go on to propose an array of policies popular with progressives. She sought to increase pay for public-school teachers by an average of $13,500 through a bump in the estate tax.\n\nShe also called for an assault weapons ban and said she would sign an executive order mandating background checks for customers of any dealer who sold more than five guns in a year. And she sought to close the gender pay gap by requiring large companies to certify that men and women were paid equally.\n\nBut for all her liberal policy proposals in the 2020 campaign, Harris was frequently viewed through her biography. She leaned into her record as a former prosecutor and California attorney general, but many voters were well aware of her status as a Black and South Asian woman who had marched with her immigrant mother in civil rights demonstrations in California.\n\n\"I don't know that the policy stuff is what people were talking about -- it was all biography,\" said Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic Party chair who backed Harris in the 2020 campaign. \"She's always been complex policy-wise, but I think people look at her and expect a thing. She's going to talk about law and order and being a prosecutor.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Harris ended her 11-month bid as one of the more progressive candidates in a crowded field.\n\nBut the recent clarifications on her current positions, and the speed at which her fledgling campaign moved to make them, also demonstrate the Harris team's need to define the presumptive Democratic nominee - lest Republicans beat them to it. Even as Harris has energized Democrats and boosted the ticket's appeal to Black, Latino and younger voters, she is also seeking a running mate who is likely to be a White man with a more centrist persona.\n\nThe push to bolster a more moderate image comes as former President Donald Trump and his campaign have ratcheted up criticisms of Harris, seeking to frame her as more liberal than Biden and highlight her California roots. The Trump campaign is up with two ads attacking Harris on border security and describing her as \"dangerously liberal.\" The $12 million ad buy will air in six battleground states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nDuring a Saturday rally in Minnesota, Trump called Harris the \"number one most radical left Democrat in the entire Senate,\" a reference to a since retracted GovTrack legislator ranking that rated her the most liberal member of the Senate in 2019 based on the bills she introduced and co-sponsored.\n\nNo ban on fracking\n\nAt that same rally, Trump accused Harris of trying to hide her past opposition to fracking, the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations - and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. A Harris campaign official said Monday she no longer supports a fracking ban.\n\nDuring a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris was asked if she would commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on her first day in office.\n\n\"There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands,\" Harris said at the time.\n\nHarris acknowledged that it would take legislation to restrict fracking beyond federal lands, and pointed to the residual health impacts of fracking on local communities.\n\nSingle-payer health care\n\nHarris' campaign also confirmed this week that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system.\n\nThe vice president's shifting stances on health care plagued her throughout her 2020 campaign.\n\nDuring her first year in the Senate, she co-sponsored independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All legislation, which would create a government-run health insurance program and essentially end the private insurance market. During a January 2019 CNN town hall right after she launched her first presidential campaign, Harris said she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All.\n\n\"We need to have Medicare for all,\" she said in response to a question.\n\nThe health care plan she rolled out that July stopped short of completely eliminating private insurance. Instead, it would have shifted the US to a government-backed health insurance system by transitioning to a Medicare-for-All-type system over 10 years and continuing to allow private insurance companies to offer Medicare plans.\n\nHarris argued that she adjusted her plan based on feedback she received from voters, and was willing to deal with the political fallout.\n\n\"I said to my team, 'We need to do a better plan, this is not good enough.' And I said to my team, 'I know we're going to take a political hit for it,'\" Harris said during an interview with \"Axios on HBO\" that aired October 2019. \"I knew I'd be called a flip flopper for that.\"\n\nSince becoming Biden's vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market.\n\nBorder control\n\nAs a presidential candidate in the leadup to 2020, Harris suggested that Democrats needed to \"critically examine\" the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), when asked whether she sided with Democrats arguing to abolish the department.\n\n\"We need to probably think about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is wrong with the way it's conducting itself,\" Harris told MSNBC in an interview at the time.\n\nAs apprehensions and border crossings skyrocketed over the course of Biden's term, the Biden-Harris administration moved to support increasing resources for ICE and implementing tighter policy controls to try to limit the surge of migrants.\n\nAs vice president, Harris supported a bipartisan border bill that would have ramped up enforcement at the US-Mexico border. The package, which ultimately failed to advance, would have provided thousands of additional customs and asylum officers, as well as tens of thousands of additional detention beds for ICE.\n\nIn June 2024, the White House announced a crackdown on asylum claims meant to continue reducing the flow - a policy that Harris' campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, indicated would continue under a Harris administration.\n\n\"I think at this point, you know, the policies that are, you know, having a real impact on ensuring that we have security and order at our border are policies that will continue,\" Chavez Rodriguez told CBS News.\n\nPolice funding\n\nIn the midst of nationwide 2020 protests sparked by George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer, Harris voiced support for the \"defund the police\" movement, which argues for redirecting funds from law enforcement to social services.\n\n\"This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,\" Harris said in a June 2020 radio interview, CNN's KFile reported.\n\nThroughout the summer, Harris supported the movement and called for demilitarizing police departments. Biden, the 2020 Democratic nominee, called for policing reform but denounced the idea of defunding departments. As a ticket, they also opposed the movement.\n\n\"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,\" former Harris press secretary Sabrina Singh said in October 2020. \"Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.\"\n\nDemocrats largely backed away from calls to defund the police after Republicans attempted to tie the movement to increases in crime during the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, walked back a \"defund the police\" sentiment voiced by Harris in 2020, saying what she meant is she supports being \"tough and smart on crime.\"\n\n\"Her position has always been that you can both be tough and smart on crime, and it requires funding police, but it also requires funding rehabilitation and things that might criminal justice system safer,\" Landrieu told CNN's Pamela Brown. \"You can do both.\"\n\nCNN's Tami Luhby, Donald Judd and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this story.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

She's on record wanting to abolish ICE (which she compared to the KKK), letting criminals like the Boston Marathon bomber and rapists vote, banning fracking and offshore drilling, defunding the police, providing US taxpayer subsidized healthcare to illegals, and banning private health insurance.\n\nAccording to the NY Times, \"video clips of her old statements and interviews are being weaponized as Republicans aim to define her as a left-wing radical who is out of step with swing voters.\"\n\n\"The archive is deep,\" said Brad Todd, a Republican strategist and ad maker who is working with David McCormick, the G.O.P. Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, among other campaigns. \"We will run out of time before we run out of video clips of Kamala Harris saying wacky California liberal things. I'm just not sure that the rest of this campaign includes much besides that.\"\n\nTo that end, McCormick's campaign has produced one of the first TV ads to attack Harris on her longstanding positions.\n\nOn Friday, the Harris campaign announced that she no longer wants to ban fracking - a 'significant shift' from where she stood four years ago. She's also reversed course on funding for border enforcement, no longer supports a single-payer health insurance program, and has walked back liberal fever dreams of a mandatory gun buyback.\n\nShe is no longer pushing for a single-payer health care system, and on Friday her campaign said she would maintain Mr. Biden's pledge not to raise income taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year. -NYT\n\nPacking the Court? Nah...\n\nOn Monday, as Mr. Biden prepared a speech in Texas calling for term limits and ethics guidelines for Supreme Court justices, the Trump campaign resurfaced statements Ms. Harris made in 2019 saying she was \"open to this conversation\" about expanding the Supreme Court. Ms. Harris, in a statement released by her campaign, endorsed Mr. Biden's proposal, which does not call for adding additional justices to the court.\n\nAccording to Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank, Harris has 'evolved' into a Biden style centrist (if centrism is defined as letting 20+ million illegals into the country and cooking Americans with inflation).\n\n\"There's a tremendous difference in changing one's policy ideas and changing one's principles,\" said Bennett. \"She has not changed her principles. She still thinks climate change is an existential threat -- she just doesn't think the Green New Deal is the way to address it.\"\n\nSure Matt.\n\nThe Times also hints that Harris is essentially an idiot who didn't really understand her own positions while running for president in 2020.\n\n...during that race, Ms. Harris also often appeared as if she were not sure what she believed. In a CNN town-hall event the day after what was widely viewed as a successful campaign rollout in Oakland, Calif., she appeared tentative while discussing health care policy, eventually saying she would eliminate private health insurance and institute a single-payer health care program.\n\nShe would go on to propose an array of policies popular with progressives. She sought to increase pay for public-school teachers by an average of $13,500 through a bump in the estate tax.\n\nShe also called for an assault weapons ban and said she would sign an executive order mandating background checks for customers of any dealer who sold more than five guns in a year. And she sought to close the gender pay gap by requiring large companies to certify that men and women were paid equally.\n\nAs an obvious aside, when Harris says \"I'm open to that conversation,\" it means she has no idea what she's talking about. And she says that a lot.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type":

Harris ended her 11-month bid as one of the more progressive candidates in a crowded field.\n\nBut the recent clarifications on her current positions, and the speed at which her fledgling campaign moved to make them, also demonstrate the Harris team's need to define the presumptive Democratic nominee - lest Republicans beat them to it. Even as Harris has energized Democrats and boosted the ticket's appeal to Black, Latino and younger voters, she is also seeking a running mate who is likely to be a White man with a more centrist persona.\n\nThe push to bolster a more moderate image comes as former President Donald Trump and his campaign have ratcheted up criticisms of Harris, seeking to frame her as more liberal than Biden and highlight her California roots. The Trump campaign is up with two ads attacking Harris on border security and describing her as \"dangerously liberal.\" The $12 million ad buy will air in six battleground states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nDuring a Saturday rally in Minnesota, Trump called Harris the \"number one most radical left Democrat in the entire Senate,\" a reference to a since retracted GovTrack legislator ranking that rated her the most liberal member of the Senate in 2019 based on the bills she introduced and co-sponsored.\n\nNo ban on fracking\n\nAt that same rally, Trump accused Harris of trying to hide her past opposition to fracking, the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations - and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. A Harris campaign official said Monday she no longer supports a fracking ban.\n\nDuring a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, Harris was asked if she would commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on her first day in office.\n\n\"There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking, and starting with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands,\" Harris said at the time.\n\nHarris acknowledged that it would take legislation to restrict fracking beyond federal lands, and pointed to the residual health impacts of fracking on local communities.\n\nSingle-payer health care\n\nHarris' campaign also confirmed this week that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system.\n\nThe vice president's shifting stances on health care plagued her throughout her 2020 campaign.\n\nDuring her first year in the Senate, she co-sponsored independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All legislation, which would create a government-run health insurance program and essentially end the private insurance market. During a January 2019 CNN town hall right after she launched her first presidential campaign, Harris said she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All.\n\n\"We need to have Medicare for all,\" she said in response to a question.\n\nThe health care plan she rolled out that July stopped short of completely eliminating private insurance. Instead, it would have shifted the US to a government-backed health insurance system by transitioning to a Medicare-for-All-type system over 10 years and continuing to allow private insurance companies to offer Medicare plans.\n\nHarris argued that she adjusted her plan based on feedback she received from voters, and was willing to deal with the political fallout.\n\n\"I said to my team, 'We need to do a better plan, this is not good enough.' And I said to my team, 'I know we're going to take a political hit for it,'\" Harris said during an interview with \"Axios on HBO\" that aired October 2019. \"I knew I'd be called a flip flopper for that.\"\n\nSince becoming Biden's vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market.\n\nBorder control\n\nAs a presidential candidate in the leadup to 2020, Harris suggested that Democrats needed to \"critically examine\" the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), when asked whether she sided with Democrats arguing to abolish the department.\n\n\"We need to probably think about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is wrong with the way it's conducting itself,\" Harris told MSNBC in an interview at the time.\n\nAs apprehensions and border crossings skyrocketed over the course of Biden's term, the Biden-Harris administration moved to support increasing resources for ICE and implementing tighter policy controls to try to limit the surge of migrants.\n\nAs vice president, Harris supported a bipartisan border bill that would have ramped up enforcement at the US-Mexico border. The package, which ultimately failed to advance, would have provided thousands of additional customs and asylum officers, as well as tens of thousands of additional detention beds for ICE.\n\nIn June 2024, the White House announced a crackdown on asylum claims meant to continue reducing the flow - a policy that Harris' campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, indicated would continue under a Harris administration.\n\n\"I think at this point, you know, the policies that are, you know, having a real impact on ensuring that we have security and order at our border are policies that will continue,\" Chavez Rodriguez told CBS News.\n\nPolice funding\n\nIn the midst of nationwide 2020 protests sparked by George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer, Harris voiced support for the \"defund the police\" movement, which argues for redirecting funds from law enforcement to social services.\n\n\"This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,\" Harris said in a June 2020 radio interview, CNN's KFile reported.\n\nThroughout the summer, Harris supported the movement and called for demilitarizing police departments. Biden, the 2020 Democratic nominee, called for policing reform but denounced the idea of defunding departments. As a ticket, they also opposed the movement.\n\n\"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,\" former Harris press secretary Sabrina Singh said in October 2020. \"Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.\"\n\nDemocrats largely backed away from calls to defund the police after Republicans attempted to tie the movement to increases in crime during the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, walked back a \"defund the police\" sentiment voiced by Harris in 2020, saying what she meant is she supports being \"tough and smart on crime.\"\n\n\"Her position has always been that you can both be tough and smart on crime, and it requires funding police, but it also requires funding rehabilitation and things that might criminal justice system safer,\" Landrieu told CNN's Pamela Brown. \"You can do both.\"\n\nCNN's Tami Luhby, Donald Judd and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, her campaign is now trying to clarify that she has changed her positions after Republicans flooded social media with video clips of Harris endorsing such policies -- less than 10 days after she launched her campaign following President Joe Biden's July 21 announcement that he was quitting the 2024 race.\n\nHarris' campaign now says that she endorses a ban on assault weapons rather than mandatory federal buybacks, no longer believes that fracking should be banned and does not still want a single-payer health care system, according to The New York Times. The campaign also pointed out that the vice president supported Biden's requests for more funding for border enforcement. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Co-Sponsored A Green New Deal. Now, She's Running For The Oval Office)\n\nHarris suggested during the 2020 cycle that illegal border crossings should be decriminalized, and she likened Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to the Ku Klux Klan in 2018 during her time as a senator.\n\n\"The trouble with her own words is that they are so recent! She just held these views and now she doesn't? Come on,\" Scott Jennings, a political strategist and on-air pundit for CNN, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \"She'd be better off just trying to own her authentic views. I think people are more forgiving of authenticity than they are of bullshit anonymous statements from campaign flaks trying to clean it up.\"\n\nIn 2021, Biden deputized Harris to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central American countries to address the root causes of illegal immigration to the U.S., which she once said include a \"lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience.\" Over the course of Biden's first term in office, authorities have encountered at least 6.7 million illegal immigrants at the southwest border, according to the House Committees on Homeland Security and Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThe Trump campaign is hoping to get Harris in off-script situations -- whether in debates or unscripted interviews -- so that she has to defend her record and previous comments on the spot, the Daily Caller reported Tuesday.\n\n\"The Trump campaign is more than competent enough to make her own words stick,\" Jennings told the DCNF.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

At the same time, Harris wants credit for accomplishments that were achieved under Biden while also charting her own course forward.\n\nA look at some key topics and how Harris has approached them.\n\nHarris took several progressive stances on immigration when she sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. She wanted immigrants who were in the country illegally to be eligible for government healthcare, and she wanted to decriminalize border crossings.\n\nWhen Harris became Biden's vice president, the administration unraveled some of Trump's harshest immigration policies, and Harris worked on improving conditions in Central American countries to reduce the flow of migrants toward the United States. However, illegal crossings reached historic levels, creating a political crisis for the White House. Republicans have blamed Harris for failures to secure the border.\n\nBiden ultimately implemented restrictions on seeking asylum, frustrating immigration advocates but significantly reducing crossings. The Harris campaign said the vice president also supports Biden's request for more money for border enforcement.\n\nDemocrats have been divided over Biden's approach to the war in Gaza. While the president has expressed concern about Palestinian deaths, he's also been a steadfast supporter of Israeli military operations despite calls to cut off U.S. weapons shipments.\n\nHarris has publicly hewed closely to the administration's views, but she's chosen different issues to emphasize. She's spoken about planning for the \"day after\" in Gaza, when extensive rebuilding would be necessary, and she's focused on suffering among Palestinian civilians. The most recent example came last week following Harris' meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \"Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,\" she said.\n\nEver since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, Biden and Harris have emphasized the need to restore nationwide abortion rights. The goal, they say, is to pass legislation if Democrats retake full control of Congress.\n\nHowever, Harris and Biden don't always approach the issue in the same way. As a lifelong Catholic who initially felt that Roe v. Wade went too far, Biden rarely uses the word \"abortion\" and prefers to talk in terms of protecting people from government intrusion into their lives.\n\nHarris speaks much more bluntly about the topic, and she visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota earlier this year. The battle for abortion rights is expected to be a centerpiece of her campaign for the presidency.\n\nHarris started her career in elected office as San Francisco's district attorney, and the politics of law enforcement have been turbulent over the years. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Harris expressed praise for the \"defund the police\" movement and questioned whether money was being effectively spent on public safety.\n\nThe White House tried to overhaul policing, but the legislation stalled on Capitol Hill, and Biden ultimately settled for issuing an executive order. The administration also pumped more money into local departments.\n\nNow Harris is embracing her law enforcement background as she runs against Trump, who is the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\nWhile seeking the 2020 nomination, Harris said she would ban fracking and pursue the Green New Deal, a sweeping progressive effort to shift the country toward renewable energy.\n\nThe White House took a more measured approach. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by Biden, pumped $375 billion into the fight against climate change, mostly through the creation of financial incentives for clean technologies. U.S. oil production also hit a record high even though Biden also pursued conservation efforts.\n\nThe Harris campaign said she would no longer try to stop fracking if elected this year.\n\nAssociated Press writer Olga R.

The problem? It's not going to work.\n\nThe New York Times highlighted a series of topics on which the vice president has seemingly backed off her more leftist positions. When it comes to fracking, she previously indicated that she opposed it. Yet, on Friday, she claimed she did not favor banning the practice any longer.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump brought this up during a Saturday rally in Minnesota. \"She pledged to ban fracking. No fracking? Oh, that's going to do well in Pennsylvania, isn't it?\" he said.\n\nNext, we have healthcare, one of the top issues for voters this election season. Previously, Harris supported Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) plan for a single-payer system that would eliminate private insurance companies. Essentially, Harris and Sanders support having the government take over healthcare completely and impose a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nNow, it seems Harris is backing away from that idea. \"She is no longer pushing for a single-payer health care system, and on Friday her campaign said she would maintain Mr. Biden's pledge not to raise income taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nWhat about immigration? Under the Biden administration, she has made her stance clear: Pretend to crack down on the border without actually cracking down on the southern border. However, in the past, she has advocated for disbanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nWhen it comes to guns, Harris' flip-flop wasn't quite as drastic. In the past, she supported a ban on \"assault weapons\" and requiring anyone who sells more than five firearms per year to conduct background checks on all customers. She also supported a mandatory federal gun buyback program. Now, she has changed course on the latter, but still wants the former.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see Harris change some of her more radical positions as the campaign rolls forward. But will it work?\n\nProbably not.\n\nHarris extreme leftist positions have already been baked into the cake for years. Anyone who pays attention to politics knows that Harris has far more in common with AOC than with the average voter.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and conservative media will be highlighting her socialist policy preference ad nauseam between now and November. The vice president will not be able to hide from history. If and when Trump debates her, he will be hammering these radical positions all throughout the proceedings.\n\nAlso, there is another important point that should not go unaddressed: The fact that she is lying. There is absolutely no way that Harris has had a magical change of heart regarding the policy positions on which she ran during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. If she is elected and Democrats take control of the House of Representatives, there can be no doubt that we will be moving even closer to single payer healthcare, a ban on fracking, and onerous gun control laws - and that absolutely nothing will be done to secure our borders.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-payer healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_buyback_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun buyback program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/325/10c64ad0-77e5-454f-93b3-664df7d3816f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775670", "eventUri": "eng-9775670", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Her campaign said on Friday she would \"not ban fracking\" if elected later this year.\n\nMs Harris has positioned herself as a tough former prosecutor in the early days of her campaign, as she attempts to define herself against Trump, a convicted felon.\n\nIn her first major speech, she said she \"took on perpetrators of all kinds\" in her role as California's district attorney. She has since rowed back on her 2020 statement that cities should \"redirect resources\" away from policing in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd.\n\nTrump's attack ad comes after Republicans pointed to Ms Harris's previous statements on the US migration crisis, in which she called for a more humanitarian approach.\n\nShe said in 2021: \"This issue cannot be reduced to a political issue. We're talking about children, we're talking about families, we are talking about suffering.\"\n\nBut on Saturday, her campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said that Mr Biden's plan for a tough new border crackdown \"will continue\".\n\nSome Democrats fear that the border is a major weakness for Ms Harris, who is looking to win back support in Arizona ahead of polling day. Voters in the state, which borders Mexico, are more likely to have concerns about illegal migration.\n\nResponding to Trump's border attack ads, a spokesman for her campaign accused him of peddling \"his trademark lies\" about her policy positions.\n\n\"As a former district attorney, attorney general and now Vice-President, Kamala Harris has spent her career taking on and prosecuting violent criminals and making our communities safer,\" the spokesman told The New York Times. \"She'll do the same as President.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"},

Will Americans Buy It In Time For Election Day?", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has said she no longer endorses a ban on fracking, but political strategists and energy experts say the sudden policy shift will do little to move the needle with key voters in November.\n\nHarris said in 2020 there is \"no question\" she would end fracking if elected president, but her campaign recently told The Hill she no longer wants to outlaw the practice after videos of her endorsing a ban resurfaced following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race. The campaign can walk back Harris' old fracking position as it pleases, but it likely won't be enough to allay the concerns of crucial voting blocs -- particularly more rural, blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania -- that Harris may wage war on the industry or otherwise escalate Biden's climate agenda to their detriment if elected, political strategists and energy experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\"She is going to find herself between a rock and a hard place on the issue of fracking, and also other issues like Gaza, too. She has all of her past statements, and the Biden-Harris administration record, which is against fracking and exports of liquefied natural gas,\" Jon McHenry, a GOP polling analyst and vice president at North Star Opinion Research, told the DCNF. \"And that's great for her base supporters, the people who were upset about Joe Biden representing Democrats a couple weeks ago and are excited about Kamala Harris, who want her to ban fracking, and they're excited to have a younger, more liberal candidate running for president.\" (RELATED: Trump Campaign's Simple Plan To Destroy Kamala Harris: Get Her Off-Script)\n\n\"The problem is she's got to win independents in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Michigan and Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, who want to see more energy developed in this country and for us to be more energy independent,\" McHenry continued. \"She wants to have her energy and ban it too.\"\n\nHowever, Harris could find a politically viable solution to her public perception problem on fracking if she were to disavow her old position and explain to voters that experiences in the White House -- such as seeing how global energy markets were impacted by the Ukraine war -- led her to change her mind, McHenry explained to the DCNF.\n\nFracking is a technique for extracting oil and gas from certain underground rock formations, and it enabled a natural gas boom in the U.S., with American natural gas consumption increasing by approximately 40% between 2000 and 2023 as the U.S. became the global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Biden administration decided in January to freeze approvals for new LNG export terminals, a move that critics say was meant to appease climate-focused voters and deep-pocketed environmental interests ahead of an election.\n\n\"Climate change and banning fracking were CENTRAL to her 2020 campaign! I mean, she went on the Tonight Show and performed a song about it! Nobody is going to believe anything other than she's a climate cultist,\" Scott Jennings, a political strategist and an on-air pundit for CNN, told the DCNF. \"She's the Greta of the U.S. government, and that ought to scare the bejeezus out of every energy worker in Pennsylvania and any American who would suffer under her obviously radical views.\"\n\nHarris has already racked up endorsements from major, deep-pocketed environmental organizations that oppose fracking just weeks after announcing her candidacy. Meanwhile, two of the more radical groups in the environmentalist movement -- the Sunrise Movement and Climate Defiance -- have so far withheld official endorsements.\n\n\"If I'm looking at the options around the election this November, there's a lot of ways in which Kamala Harris will be immensely easier to pressure and change on that than a Donald Trump presidency would,\" Aru Shiney-Ajay, the Sunrise Movement's executive director, told reporters Monday, according to Politico.\n\nClimate Defiance, which has protested against Harris with one of its disruptive demonstrations, has made demands for Harris to meet to demonstrate that she is a candidate who can \"usher in an era of equity and sustainability.\" The demands include ensuring that there is no more oil and gas infrastructure development and ending oil and gas leasing on federally-controlled lands and waters.\n\nThe political and electoral ramifications of Harris' fracking flip-flop could be most visible in Pennsylvania, a huge natural gas producer and a crucial swing state in the 2024 cycle. Former President Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania in 2016 by a tight margin before losing it to Biden in 2020 in another close race; the state figures to be hotly-contested again in 2024, according to McHenry, with a new poll from Susquehanna Polling showing Harris up on Trump by four percentage points with 7% of respondents unsure who they will back in November.\n\nPennsylvania produced more natural gas than any state other than Texas in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the natural gas industry directly or indirectly supported about 123,000 jobs in the state as of 2022, according to an August 2023 report prepared by FTI Consulting for the Marcellus Shale Coalition. (RELATED: Could Joe Biden's Natural Gas Pause Cost Dems The Senate In November?)\n\n\"Going back on her 2019 comments about banning fracking or abolishing the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal doesn't change the facts that the Biden-Harris administration paused the expansion of LNG exports, exacerbated our looming reliability crisis with subsidized unreliable weather-dependent energy sources with the Inflation Reduction Act, and allowed federal agencies to over-regulate every coal and natural gas power plant in the nation providing reliable and affordable energy,\" Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9liveau, senior manager of energy policy for the Commonwealth Foundation, told the DCNF. \"Harris can backpedal on her 2019 comments all she wants, but her record from the last four years is clear.\"\n\nDave McCormick, the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, is already running an advertisement attacking Harris' energy positions and tying together the vice president and his opponent, incumbent Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey.\n\nSome pundits have suggested that Harris could mitigate risks she may face in Pennsylvania by picking Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. However, selecting Shapiro could cause problems for Harris in other states and isolate voting blocs she needs to win due to his support of Israel and criticisms of pro-Palestinian activists, McHenry told the DCNF.\n\n\"Bob Casey and Kamala Harris have opposed Pennsylvania energy every step of the way, and their anti-fossil fuel agenda would be disastrous for our commonwealth and the 600,000 workers who rely on the energy sector for a paycheck,\" McCormick said in a statement shared with the DCNF. \"Banning fracking and abolishing the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal may be popular among the far-left, but here in Pennsylvania these radical proposals are radically out of step with the needs of working families.\"\n\nThe Harris and Casey campaigns did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Harris herself and Democrats are mostly working to make her campaign about the future. Republicans, on the other hand, are working very hard to make it all about her past.\n\nIn the handful of campaign stops Harris has made since taking the mantle from President Joe Biden, she has begun to pry herself apart from the current administration to paint a picture of what a future United States under her leadership can look like.\n\n\"We share a vision for the future of our nation,\" Harris said at a convention of the historically black sorority Zeta Phi Beta last week. \"A future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead. A future of social justice, health justice, economic justice. Ours is a vision of a future in which we realize the promise of America.\"\n\nHarris is trying to outrun her liberal past, something that White House Reporter Naomi Lim pointed out in the third part of our series examining the ways Democrats and Republicans use the waning days of the 2024 presidential campaign to define the late entrant.\n\n\"Former President Donald Trump has been workshopping political attacks on a new Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, and one that he'd like to see stick is 'radical Left lunatic,'\" Naomi wrote.\n\n\"But as other Republicans criticize her as a 'San Francisco liberal,' more traditional political nomenclature, the strategy is clear: caricature Harris for her past policy positions,\" she wrote.\n\nThere is a long state and strong national record of Harris running and acting as a quintessential liberal. Naomi laid out a laundry list of items Republicans are gleefully pointing out Harris said she supported, including but not limited to \"her past support of Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and Black Lives Matter, to her backing an assault weapons buyback program and the reconstruction of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement federal agency from 'scratch.'\"\n\nIn the early days of her 2024 campaign, Harris has tried tacking to the center, walking back her support for a forced gun buyback program and her opposition to fracking -- a vital energy matter that could single-handedly lose her the support of Pennsylvania.\n\nSo, Republicans are confident they have the upper hand. They can either remind voters about Harris's liberal voting record -- she was one of the most left-leaning senators in Congress, and that ranking has been pulled from the GovTrack platform, sending critics into fits of simultaneous rage and joy -- or they can let the presumptive Democratic nominee appear to flip-flop on her central campaign issues.\n\nWhile they pummel Harris for her voting and prosecutorial record, one GOP strategist told Naomi that Republicans would do themselves good by updating the language they use for voters. Portraying Harris as a \"leftist\" rather than a \"liberal\" would come across as a stronger line of attack -- and would go some way in recovering the traditional meaning of \"liberal,\" which strategist Ron Nehring said is often more descriptive of Republicans than Democrats.\n\n\"The traditional meaning of the term 'liberal' refers to being free and open, which more accurately describes conservatives today than the woke Left, which won't even tolerate pronouns they don't like, and labels as a 'hater' anyone who believes women's sports should be for ... women,\" Nehring told Naomi. \"In today's polarized society, activists in both parties easily fall into the trap of just echoing terms which work well for people in their camp but don't work for appealing beyond it. Labeling Harris a 'liberal,' as opposed to other, more persuasive terms, is an example.\"\n\nClick here to read more about the fine line Harris has to walk that Republicans are happy to play up in the race to define her before Election Day.\n\nThe tightrope act just mentioned hasn't deterred the Democratic Party's left wing from getting on board with Harris's candidacy, even if some of the most important figures weren't the first in line to back her.\n\nCongress and Campaigns Editor David Sivak took a look at the steady march of the party's most prominent left-wingers standing behind Harris despite her going soft on some of their most cherished hard-line ideas.\n\n\"Harris has attempted to reverse or clarify many of the liberal views she espoused five years ago, during her run in the 2020 presidential primary,\" David wrote. \"On Friday, her campaign disavowed her previous support for a ban on fracking, while a campaign spokesperson told the Washington Examiner she would not pursue the forced buyback of military-style assault weapons or single-payer healthcare, an issue she has waffled on for years.\"\n\nThe party's left wing is typified by the Northeast stalwart who, ironically, isn't a Democrat. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has arguably done as much to pull the Democratic Party leftward in the last decade as Trump has done to move the Republican Party farther to the right. Sanders ran an insurgent 2016 campaign that mainstreamed ideas about a \"Green New Deal\" and popularized talking about single-payer healthcare.\n\nSanders was slow to endorse Harris, opting to wait until she had the delegate count sewn up to put her in the driver's seat and giving her a chance to offer \"specificity\" on her views about a range of liberal programs.\n\n\"His wish list items include expanding Medicare to include dental and vision as well as a nationwide cap on rent,\" David wrote. \"It is not clear what commitments, if any, Harris made to earn Sanders's support.\"\n\nBesides flipping her support for fracking, a move then-candidate John Fetterman also made when he was running for the Pennsylvania Senate seat in 2022, the primary progressive betrayal from Harris has been her walking back support for Sanders's Medicare for All plan that included eliminating private insurance plans.\n\nThe Senate's other most prominent progressive member, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), told David she still supports the healthcare overhaul but acknowledged that \"it's not where we are right now.\"\n\n\"Instead, Warren, who supports the bill to this day, espoused an incrementalist approach focused on preserving the gains Democrats made under Biden and, before him, President Barack Obama,\" David wrote.\n\nWith the nomination all but locked in ahead of the virtual roll call vote set to begin this week that will cement her place as the nominee ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, the support of progressives in Congress is less important than if she had a bitter convention floor fight ahead of her. But it will be important to watch how the Sanders-Warren wing approaches a Harris administration. Their support now could come with progressive policy strings attached next year when the vice president has more space to flex her political muscle as the occupant of the White House rather than the Naval Observatory on the other side of town.\n\nClick here to read more about Harris's winning ways with her party's progressive wing.\n\nWe had several exciting, interesting, if not pivotal, primary contests last month. Few, if any, of them will have massive knock-on effects for the general election contests in November, but one of the two incumbent-ousting shockers is still getting litigated.\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) was the first \"Squad\" member to lose his seat in the House when his Capitol Hill antics and fierce opposition to and criticism of Israel came back to bite him. Westchester County Executive George Latimer easily dispatched Bowman in their June 25 primary contest.\n\nA week earlier, Rep. Bob Good (R-VA) made history as the first House Freedom Caucus chairman to lose his seat. That race, against former Navy SEAL John McGuire, was much closer at just 374 votes and is going to a recount today, Congressional Reporter Rachel Schilke wrote for us this morning.\n\nThe quick rundown of what today means for both candidates is simple -- \"If McGuire wins the recount, Good will become the first House Republican incumbent to lose a primary challenge this election cycle.\"\n\n\"If the recount reaffirms McGuire's victory, then there is no challenge that either campaign can make,\" she wrote.\n\nAnd Good has more than just his job on the line today. Because the margin is so small, Good is footing the bill for the recount process himself. The recount is estimated to cost $96,500, though that price could fluctuate up or down depending on how long the process takes. If nothing changes and Good still comes out as the loser, he'll have to pay the tab. However, he'll be reimbursed if the recount reverses the contest.\n\nBiden administration to email all student loan holders about possible debt relief\n\nHow JB Pritzker, a rumored Kamala VP contender, boosted companies linked to his cousin\n\nTrial begins for Colorado activist over 2020 voting data breach\n\nUncertainty about fate of Trump tax cuts holding back millions of jobs: Survey\n\nGOP put back on defense after Biden's exit brings surge to Harris and Democrats\n\nKari Lake eked out her expected win in the Arizona GOP primary to fight to replace Kyrsten Sinema\n\nIsrael was busy yesterday, executing successful strikes on Hamas and Hezbollah leaders\n\nTrump and Co. danced on the cinders as Project 2025 looks to be immolating\n\nHarris really wants to have her own debate moment with Trump\n\nBiden has no public events scheduled, but he will receive his daily brief at 10 a.m. He will receive a briefing on the implementation of important provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act at 11 a.m.\n\nBiden and Harris will have lunch at 12:45 p.m.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will brief reporters at 1:30 p.m.\n\nBiden will be briefed on actions his administration is taking to crack down on drug smuggling at 2:30 p.m.\n\nBiden will meet with U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine's Economic Recovery Penny Pritzker at 3:45 p.m.\n\nHarris will fly to Houston, Texas, where she will speak at a \"political event\" at 7:15 p.m. She will deliver remarks at the Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority's 60th International Biennial Boule at 8:15 p.m.\n\nTrump is attending the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago, where he will speak with a panel before he hosts a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at 6 p.m.\n\nSen.

She no longer backs a single-payer health care system after previously endorsing a \"Medicare for All\" proposal, the campaign official confirmed, or a government-run, gun-buyback program.\n\nHarris also supports additional border funding put forward by the Biden administration, a break from her 2020 primary stance that Immigration and Customs Enforcement should, at a minimum, be reformed.\n\nRepublicans say the policy pivots give them another arrow in their quiver for the three-month sprint to November.\n\n\"She's going to say whatever she thinks will get her elected, but I don't know how you trust anything someone says when they take 180-degree opposite positions depending on who they're talking to,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. \"I just think she's not a credible person.\"\n\n\"I'm always a little shocked and surprised at cynicism and hypocrisy,\" he added when asked if he is at all surprised by the rebrand.\n\nHarris's allies have pushed back, arguing the electorate will care more about her vision for the future than stances she took five years ago.\n\n\"They need to let Kamala go out there and win people over. Talk about the issues that matter to swing-state voters, the economy, child card, abortion and fertility treatment rights,\" said one Democratic strategist who has worked with Harris. \"Let Kamala be Kamala and she'll win people over like she always does. You already see that with her exploding on TikTok with young people.\"\n\n\"Remember, voters care a lot more about the future than the past. They've been clamoring for new leaders in this race,\" the strategist added. \"And the future looks a lot more like Kamala Harris than it does Donald Trump.\"\n\nStill, the vice president's reversal on nearly a half-dozen issues comes as she attempts to make headway in key battleground states. Among them is Pennsylvania, where fracking has been a key issue for voters for more than a decade.\n\nIn a number of interviews and appearances in 2019, Harris said she was in favor of banning the practice -- a stance David McCormick, the GOP's Senate candidate in the Keystone State, and others have sought to highlight and connect to the state's Democratic incumbent.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris-Casey energy agenda has essentially been to stop fossil fuels, and transition from lithium batteries and solar panels from China,\" McCormick told Fox News late last week. \"It truly is out of step [with] where most Pennsylvanians are.\"\n\nSen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) on Tuesday defended the switch in position, arguing that having like-minded stances with the top of the ticket is good for everyone.\n\n\"On gas extraction, I've always been supportive and very supportive and have voted against any kind of a ban,\" Casey told The Hill. \"To have alignment and consensus on that is obviously a positive.\"\n\nIn a survey released late last week by The Hill and Emerson College, Harris trails by 2 points against Trump in Pennsylvania -- the same margin the former president held over Biden ahead of the June debate that ultimately pushed the president out of the race. Trump led Biden by 5 points following the debate.\n\nSeizing on another hot-button issue, the Trump campaign on Tuesday launched its first television ad attacking Harris, focusing on her role as Biden's \"border czar\" while mixing images of migrants coming across the border and the vice president dancing.\n\nTop Trump allies argue that the latest change in Harris's political posture only feeds into the GOP's narrative that she is among the most liberal members of her party and that she cannot be trusted.\n\n\"She's got so much we can run on. It's just really exposing her to who she really is,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.). \"She's no moderate ... Joe Biden was kind of a puppet of the progressive movement. She is the progressive movement.\"\n\n\"She can't flip-flop her positions because she was there as a senator. She ran on it, she campaigned on it and since she's been vice president, she's spoken about it multiple times,\" he continued. \"Her words will do it enough. We just have to replay it for the American people.\"\n\nTrump and his campaign have similarly shrugged off efforts by Harris and her campaign to reposition herself on certain issues, arguing it won't resonate with voters.\n\n\"In politics, when you start off saying something, that's where you are. And she was for defund the police. She was for open borders. She was for having anybody come in,\" Trump told Fox News on Monday.\n\nTrump may not be the ideal messenger for that argument, however. He has frequently reversed himself on various policy matters, including this year, when he came out against a ban on TikTok despite signing an executive order to ban the app while he was president.\n\nTaylor Budowich, head of the pro-Trump super PAC MAGA Inc., argued Harris \"has always been\" a \"dangerous liberal,\" a sign of how attack ads will target the vice president in the months to come.\n\n\"Kamala is going to run on whatever dishonest, poll-tested and focus-grouped agenda her consultants cook up. It won't work,\" Budowich posted on the social platform X.\n\nFor now, polling since Harris entered the race as the likely Democratic nominee has shown the vice president has gotten a bump in approval rating. An ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted Friday and Saturday showed Harris's favorability rose from 35 percent to 43 percent compared to just a week ago, while her unfavorability rating dropped from 46 percent to 42 percent.\n\nAnd Harris has pushed back on some of the accusations from Republicans.\n\n\"You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, it's just plain weird,\" Harris told donors in Massachusetts.\n\n\"But the bottom line is we have our work cut out for us. OK? We have our work cut out for us,\" she continued. \"And this is not going to be easy. But I know something about the folks in this room. We can do hard things. And we like hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "brproud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BRPROUD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_samuels@brproud.com", "name": "Brett Samuels", "type": "author",

Who is Kamala Harris?", "body": "Democratic nomination vote for Kamala Harris is set for 1 August. This time the vote is more of a formality, as Harris has already secured the support of 99% of the delegates to the upcoming party convention to win the nomination.\n\nThere was talk a year ago that it was Harris, not current President Joe Biden, who might run for office. Even then, many doubted Biden's ability to make it to the end of the current term, let alone run again. That's when the question arose: Is Harris ready to be president? The Democratic camp was not enthusiastic about it, but rather despondent. Even the U.S. mainstream media stated that Harris was practically unremembered as vice president, except for her incoherent speech and explosive laughter, which gave rise to speculation about her health.\n\nBut is Kamala Harris so hopeless? Can U.S. political technologists turn an office cinderella into a ruling queen in three months?\n\nBetting on the underdog\n\nOn the evening of 21 July, Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the race in the election that is only three months away. The statement looked bizarre. Given the situation, it was expected that the U.S. leader would speak from the Oval Office with a video address to the nation. Given that Biden was diagnosed with a coronavirus, the lack of the Oval Office footage can be forgiven. But the social media post looked, to put it mildly, inappropriate.\n\nThen another Biden post was published: \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" Once again, there is a feeling of dissonance. It's unlikely that Biden's team didn't realize that these two posts would fly around the world, read by millions of people, including voters in the United States. This is the perfect opportunity to present Harris as a potential leader. But instead, the post was about Biden's \"best decision\" and the need to \"beat Trump.\" Coincidentally or not, this brief post framed two very different images as accurately as possible: the strong, go-for-broke image of Trump, the inarticulate and fuzzy image of Harris.\n\nHere's what the vice president herself said about her run for the presidency: \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda. We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nOne gets the feeling is that without Trump, neither Biden nor Harris would have any motivation to do anything at all. Then again, everyone knows who Trump is. For some, he's a truth-teller, a nationalist in a good way, and just a \"charismatic guy.\" For others, he is a threat to liberal order, a criminal, and again a nationalist, but in a bad way.\n\nAs for who Harris is, it's hard to say. \"\"We got a fight ahead of us and we are the underdogs in this race,\" the vice president said in her first fundraiser. \"But this is a people-powered campaign and we have momentum.\"\n\nWell, it didn't get any clearer. Either the vice president hopes to win over voters with ambiguous metaphors. Or she doesn't realize who she really is and what she has to offer the people. The vice president in charge of obscure issues\n\nLast year, when there was talk in certain circles in Washington about Harris' prospects as Biden's successor, The Atlantic staff writer Elaina Calabro tried to understand why the Democrats are so skeptic about the vice president.\n\nThe journalist interviewed Harris. Calabro described her interlocutor as an intensely private person who occasionally speaks studied phrases. These qualities may have prevented Harris from communicating properly with Biden's office, as well as with U.S. officials and lawmakers.\n\nHer first year on the job was defined by rhetorical blunders, political missteps, staff turnover. She saw the departure of her chief of staff, communications director, domestic-policy adviser, national security adviser, and other aides. CNN reported at the time \"key West Wing aides are exasperated by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus from Harris and her staff\".\n\nThe New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote the following about Harris's managerial qualities: \"From her time as the San Francisco district attorney straight through her time as vice president, Harris has earned a reputation for degrading underlings and burning through staff. Biden has a coterie of people who have been with him for decades, but Harris has no such group. The Substack newsletter Open the Books ran the numbers and calculated that as of March 31 over 90 percent of the staff she had at the beginning of her vice-presidential term had left.\"\n\nMany said Harris' responsibilities were obscure. Hence the joke of the vice president being only capable of handling emails. The White House is asking Kamala Harris to monitor emails coming in, Americans joked.\n\nUltimately, the White House issued a statement insisting that Biden did, in fact, rely on his vice president as a governing partner. But Harris's reputation has never quite recovered.\n\nIn June 2021, the vice president sat down with the NBC anchor to discuss Biden's immigration agenda. The questions should have been easily anticipated -- such as whether Harris had any plans to visit the border itself, where crossings had surged. Yet when Lester Holt did ask that question, Harris threw up her hands in evident frustration. \"At some point, you know, I -- we are going to the border. We've been to the border. So this whole, this whole - this whole thing about the border. We've been to the border. We've been to the border.\" Holt corrected her: \"You haven't been to the border.\" Harris became defensive. \"And I haven't been to Europe,\" she snapped. \"I don't understand the point you're making.\"\n\nFor many Americans, Lester Holt's interview was the first real encounter with Harris as vice president. This dialogue traveled almost all the U.S. media. Harris herself avoided speaking in front of the camera for several months after that. Subsequently, the vice president repeatedly uttered incoherent phrases, which gave rise to many memes. Speculations have emerged that Harris suffers from logorrhea.\n\n\"Some politicians have minds like a jukebox,\" David Brooks wrote on the subject. \"You mention a topic, and they will play whatever record they have stored in their brain that goes with the topic. Harris has seemed less good at handling that kind of spontaneous exchange.\"\n\nBy the way, the issue of migration has been a particularly painful one for Harris. Back at the beginning of the presidential term, Biden instructed Harris to address the issue. However, the vice president has never succeeded. Under the current administration, the growth of illegal crossings of the U.S. border with Mexico has reached record levels. Governors of the southern states were outraged, which even poured into a conflict with the federal authorities. In order for Harris to \"penetrate\" the problem, Texas Governor Greg Abbott bused about 100 migrants to her home.\n\nThis state of affairs did not add to the popularity of the vice president. In June 2023, an NBC News poll showed that only 32% of respondents approved of Harris' performance in office. 49% said they viewed the vice president negatively, including 39% who were highly negative. Thus, Harris showed the worst result among U.S. vice presidents in the history of this poll. To be the first so as not to be the last\n\nDespite all the failures, it needs to be admitted that Harris managed to achieve a lot by the age of 60. She was born into an immigrant family. Her mother is a native of India, and her father comes from Jamaica. Harris graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C., with a bachelor's degree in economics and political science. Then she graduated from the University of California, where she earned a law degree. Further Harris was steadily going up the career ladder. She became District Attorney of San Francisco in 2004, and Attorney General of the State of California in 2011.\n\nHarris did not stop there. First she was elected to the US Senate, where she actively criticized Trump. In 2019, she announced her participation in the presidential race. Later, however, she withdrew her candidacy, urging supporters to vote for Biden. She did not lose. Biden became president, and Harris became the second most important person in the U.S. political hierarchy.\n\nHarris once said that she aspires to follow her mother's advice: \"As my mother used to say, \"you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you are not the last.\"\n\nIn the end, Harris became the first woman to serve as vice president, and also the first black American and the first South Asian American selected for the post. Before that, she was the first woman to become California's attorney general. In November 2021, while Biden was undergoing medical procedures, Harris became the first woman with presidential power in U.S. history.\n\nIt is also impossible to say that Harris was out of the loop as vice president. In three and a half years, she has visited several dozen countries - in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. She has held talks with a number of foreign leaders.\n\nU.S. experts note that partly thanks to Harris the so-called red wave was avoided in the congressional elections in 2022. Many predicted that Republicans, amid the failures of the Biden administration, would easily gain a majority in both houses of Congress. However, Harris made a successful move by convincing Biden to support women's right to abortion - in opposition to Republicans. The vice president spent much of 2022 traveling and speaking to voters about abortion in both \"red\" states (which support Republicans) and \"blue\" ones (which favor Democrats). Harris felt very well the mood of the country and the potential impact of the abortion issue on the campaign.The journalist for The Atlantic wrote about Harris' intelligence and diligence. \"Those closest to Harris have tried to make sense of why the vice president's positive qualities have failed to register with Americans,\" Calabro said.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama, may have found the answer. \"I think it's one of the things that plagued her in the presidential race. It looked as if she didn't know where to plant her feet. That she wasn't sort of grounded, that she didn't know exactly who she was. People can read that. When you're playing at that level, people can read that,\" Axelrod said.\n\nImage crafting mission\n\nOne can give credit to Harris' education, her diligence and ambition. Still, this does not make her an interesting and charismatic politician. If Harris and Trump had to participate in the presidential race without any outside help and influence, the former president would have had a much better chance of returning to the White House.\n\nHowever, it is not that simple. The U.S. election is not a confrontation between candidates, but a battle between the country's two key parties, or even more precisely, a battle between armies of political technologists.\n\nIf Harris still does not understand who she is, she will be explained. If needed, she will be grounded, and perhaps get a new image. The main thing Harris has accomplished is the endorsement of \"Democratic big brass\". Although a year ago, that seemed unrealistic.\n\nIn early 2023, reporters for The New York Times polled Democrats on their attitudes toward Harris. \"The painful reality for Ms. Harris is that in private conversations over the last few months, dozens of Democrats in the White House, on Capitol Hill and around the nation -- including some who helped put her on the party's 2020 ticket -- said she had not risen to the challenge of proving herself as a future leader of the party, much less the country. Even some Democrats whom her own advisers referred reporters to for supportive quotes confided privately that they had lost hope in her,\" the article said.\n\nHowever, Harris has one important advantage, a virtually non-alternative contest. The Democrats clang to Biden until the last, although they realized that the president, for obvious reasons, would not be able to hold on to a second term. When Biden decided to drop out of the race, it became obvious that there was no one to bet on but Harris.Among the first to side with Harris was the Clintons. \"Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we have got to elect her. America's future depends on it,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nFinancier George Soros and his son Alex have supported Harris. \"It's time for us all to unite around Kamala Harris and beat Donald Trump. She is the best and most qualified candidate we have,\" Alex Soros said in social media X.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi remained silent at first, provoking rumors of disagreement in the Democratic party over Harris' candidacy. But finally, Pelosi decided to endorse the vice president \"with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism about the future of the United States.\"\n\nAnother important Democrat, Barack Obama, held off on his reaction for days. \"We told her we think she'll make a fantastic President of the United States... At this critical moment for our country, we're going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November,\" the former president said.\n\nIt appears the bets are on. It's only a matter of time before Harris is nominated. Especially since she has already secured the support of the necessary number of Democrats who will vote for her party's presidential nomination.\n\nThe reality show on the roll\n\nIn the meantime, the media have rolled up their sleeves to promote Harris. Not only U.S. media, but also European. It seems that Europe fears Trump more than the U.S. Democratic Party. When you open up CNN's website, the top headline is, \"Kamala Harris has energized Democratic voters. But can she expand the map?\" Just below that is an analysis article - \"How Harris may win back a critical group of voters who abandoned Biden\". Still below is \"Republican mayor in battleground state is endorsing Kamala Harris. Hear why\".\n\nSomewhere far away is a news item about Republicans as well - \"Not just 'cat ladies': A brief history of James David Vance mocking people without children.\" By the way, this is a dig at the Republican vice presidential candidate, who is being mentioned behind the scenes as a possible successor to Trump in the next election cycle.\n\nSociologists are in the game too. Last week, Reuters published the results of a public opinion poll conducted jointly with the Ipsos sociological service. It turned out that Harris is ahead of Trump by 2% in terms of support. The vice president is favored by 44% of voters, Trump - 42%.\n\nEveryone has written about Harris' \"victory\". However, most people missed one point. A report published by Reuters says that 1,241 American adults participated in the poll. However, the Ipsos website has an important correction. The sample includes 1,018 registered voters, of whom 426 identify themselves as Democratic Party supporters and 376 as Republican Party supporters. The 50-person difference is in favor of the Democrats. So much for electoral arithmetic.\n\nIs it any wonder, considering this, that 62% of American voters are concerned that the U.S. presidential election could be rigged? By the way, the results of the poll also show this. This time the American research organization Rasmussen Reports and the analytical center Heartland Institute probed the ground. In fact, the poll also showed that almost a fifth of respondents in the 2020 election received more than one ballot in the mail or received a ballot for a person who did not live at their address.\n\nDemocrats will hold a vote on Harris' nomination as a candidate for the top U.S. public office on 1 to 5 August. The Democratic National Committee has already stated that no other candidates but Harris will be considered as part of the voting procedure. As of today, the vice president has secured the support of 3,923 delegates to the upcoming party convention, which is 99% of the votes. Therefore, the upcoming vote is rather a formality.\n\nIt is very likely that Harris and Trump will face off in a battle for the presidency in the next three months. Of course, there are other candidates. But they do not have political giants in the form of the Democratic or Republican Party - with their sponsors, influence on the media and armies of political technologists, whose work, by and large, will determine the outcome of the election campaign. In such a scenario, who Kamala Harris is and what she wants is not that important. The only thing that matters is whether they will find the right image for her and whether she will cope with the chosen role.", "source": {"uri": "eng.belta.by", "dataType": "news", "title":

On Friday, her campaign disavowed her previous support for a ban on fracking, while a campaign spokesperson told the Washington Examiner she would not pursue the forced buyback of military-style assault weapons or single-payer healthcare, an issue she has waffled on for years.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Atlanta on Tuesday, Harris promised to sign into law a bipartisan compromise on the border that was opposed by Republicans, but also progressives.\n\nThe pivot suggests Harris will run in the more centrist image of President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race earlier this month following his disastrous debate performance. It also suggests Democrats see a liability in her comments as Republicans seek to define her as a \"San Francisco radical.\"\n\nThe attempts to insulate Harris from those critiques have not cost her with progressive heavyweights, however, even those who had been holding out for commitments that she would embrace an agenda that champions their top priorities.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who ran to the left of her in the 2020 primary, declined to say whether he was disappointed with the shift, merely quipping at the Capitol on Tuesday, \"I'm disappointed that I'm late to a vote.\"\n\nBut he endorsed her run for president on Saturday, just as Harris's campaign was distancing itself from her prior policy stances.\n\nOther progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), gave Harris latitude for rejecting single-payer healthcare. Harris embraced Sanders's Medicare for All proposal in 2019 and was a co-sponsor of the bill two years earlier, but eventually rejected the idea of eliminating private plans, a position her campaign reiterated on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's not where we are right now,\" Warren, another original co-sponsor who ran against Harris in the 2020 primary, told the Washington Examiner. Instead, Warren, who supports the bill to this day, espoused an incrementalist approach focused on preserving the gains Democrats made under Biden and, before him, President Barack Obama.\n\n\"I see it as we need, as Democrats, to fight for every change that we can make that lowers costs for American families, and to push back against the Republicans who want to take away healthcare, take away student loan debt cancellation, take away $35 insulin, take away the improvements that we've been able to get,\" she said.\n\nThe support reflects the pragmatic inclination of progressives during the Biden era. Sanders lost two runs for president crusading against the Democratic establishment but has proceeded to use his political capital to exact concessions from the party.\n\nIn 2020, that was a policy blueprint he crafted with Biden to guide his presidency after Sanders agreed to drop out of the primary. With Harris, Sanders held out his endorsement until a full week after she clinched the delegates to replace Biden in the hope she would provide \"specificity\" on her views.\n\nHis wish list items include expanding Medicare to include dental and vision as well as a nationwide cap on rent. It is not clear what commitments, if any, Harris made to earn Sanders's support.\n\nHarris had embraced most progressive priorities during her 2020 run for president. She was part of a crowded Democratic field trying to differentiate themselves by running further to the left, a reputation she bolstered with her voting record in the Senate.\n\nBut this time, she enters the presidential race in the throes of the general election, when candidates often moderate their views to appeal to a broader electorate.\n\nThe abandonment of aspirational pieces of legislation such as Medicare for All may not be satisfying to the progressive voters who want to see a wholesale overhaul of climate and healthcare policy. But they do allow her to dangle enough changes to satisfy her base while neutralizing, to some extent, the warnings of Republicans who say she would crash the economy or take away rights with her proposals.\n\nOn firearms legislation, for example, Harris still supports a ban on assault-style weapons, as well as universal background checks and red flag laws.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has already signaled he will use Harris's prior positions to pillory her as a radical, while video footage from the 2020 primary, already being used by Republicans in campaign advertising, could overwhelm any effort by Harris to tack to the middle.\n\n\"She pledged to ban fracking -- no fracking, oh, that's going to do well in Pennsylvania, isn't it?\" Trump said Saturday at a rally in Minnesota. \"Remember, Pennsylvania, I said it. She wants no fracking. She's on tape. The beautiful thing about modern technology is when you say something, you're screwed if it's bad.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) downplayed Harris's evolution on healthcare, calling her views today a matter of building a winning coalition. Meanwhile, other Democrats have brought up Trump's own attempts to moderate his campaign, including his rejection of a federal abortion ban.\n\n\"I think that what she's saying is, she's gonna be president of the United States, she has to deliver compromises and find something that works,\" Booker said of Harris. \"So, she's gonna do everything she can to expand healthcare access to people. I don't think that's a big change.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_sivak@washingtonexaminer.com",

Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, showed the way with a devastating montage of Harris expressing support for every loony idea imaginable, from open borders to federal confiscation of firearms through a euphemistically named \"mandatory buyback\" program.\n\nMcCormick's ad also included clips of Harris supporting a Green New Deal; a ban on fracking and offshore drilling; single-payer health insurance; voting rights for violent felons; and even an authoritarian climate policy that would reduce consumption of red meat.\n\nIndeed, Republican strategists like Brad Todd in Pennsylvania have begun salivating at the possibilities.\n\n\"The archive is deep,\" Todd said, according to the Times. \"We will run out of time before we run out of video clips of Kamala Harris saying wacky California liberal things. I'm just not sure that the rest of this campaign includes much besides that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have responded with a two-pronged strategy designed to show contempt for voters.\n\nFirst, the Harris campaign has announced that the vice president no longer holds those positions.\n\nThat's right. For the purposes of manipulating the American electorate, Harris will publicly pretend that she no longer believes any of the things she said on video.\n\nAccording to the Times, that includes abandoning support for open borders, a gun buyback program and single-payer health insurance.\n\nFurthermore, she plans to position herself \"as a candidate with deep ties to law enforcement.\" So much for felons' voting rights.\n\nWhat about the crazy climate worshipers? Well, Harris also announced that she no longer supports a ban on fracking.\n\nOn that broader issue, Matt Bennett of the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way tried to reframe Harris as pragmatic.\n\n\"There's a tremendous difference in changing one's policy ideas and changing one's principles,\" Bennett said. \"She has not changed her principles. She still thinks climate change is an existential threat -- she just doesn't think the Green New Deal is the way to address it.\"\n\nIn other words, the vice president has appeared to retreat from literally every progressive stance she once adopted. The key word, of course, is \"appeared.\" That is the first prong in the strategy.\n\nThe second prong involves appealing to voters who care only about child sacrifice and identity politics.\n\nIn fact, the Times devoted a whopping eight paragraphs to Harris' views and proposals regarding abortion. She likes abortion. She likes it so much that she regards it as a civil rights issue requiring federal protection.\n\nAbove all, though, the Harris campaign believes that voters will jump at the chance to elect a woman of color.\n\nSue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic Party chairwoman and 2020 Harris supporter, thinks voters should ignore all those complicated issues and vote for the candidate who makes them feel good about themselves.\n\n\"I don't know that the policy stuff is what people were talking about -- it was all biography,\" Dvorsky said. \"She's always been complex policy-wise, but I think people look at her and expect a thing. She's going to talk about law and order and being a prosecutor.\"\n\nThere you have it. Voters should forget about policy and simply \"expect a thing,\" whatever that means.\n\nIn fact, repellent MSNBC host Joy Reid said something similar last week when she tried to manipulate black voters into supporting Harris as a way of showing that they had a connection to the culture, whatever that means.\n\nSo Republicans will run clips of Harris saying crazy California things about open borders, gun control, climate and crime. And Democrats will answer by assuring voters that she no longer believes those things.\n\nThen, Democrats will shore up both the TikTok, attention-deficit demographic and the affluent-liberal-with-luxury-beliefs demographic by telling them to \"expect a thing\" from their new cultural phenomenon of a candidate.\n\nAnd they think principled progressives will go along with this?\n\nPerhaps we should hold off on asking them why they would adopt such an insane strategy until after they have formally nominated her.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType":

Will Americans Buy It In Time For Election Day? |", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has said she no longer endorses a ban on fracking, but political strategists and energy experts say the sudden policy shift will do little to move the needle with key voters in November.\n\nHarris said in 2020 there is \"no question\" she would end fracking if elected president, but her campaign recently told The Hill she no longer wants to outlaw the practice after videos of her endorsing a ban resurfaced following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race. The campaign can walk back Harris' old fracking position as it pleases, but it likely won't be enough to allay the concerns of crucial voting blocs -- particularly more rural, blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania -- that Harris may wage war on the industry or otherwise escalate Biden's climate agenda to their detriment if elected, political strategists and energy experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\"She is going to find herself between a rock and a hard place on the issue of fracking, and also other issues like Gaza, too. She has all of her past statements, and the Biden-Harris administration record, which is against fracking and exports of liquefied natural gas,\" Jon McHenry, a GOP polling analyst and vice president at North Star Opinion Research, told the DCNF. \"And that's great for her base supporters, the people who were upset about Joe Biden representing Democrats a couple weeks ago and are excited about Kamala Harris, who want her to ban fracking, and they're excited to have a younger, more liberal candidate running for president.\"\n\n\"The problem is she's got to win independents in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Michigan and Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, who want to see more energy developed in this country and for us to be more energy independent,\" McHenry continued. \"She wants to have her energy and ban it too.\"\n\nHowever, Harris could find a politically viable solution to her public perception problem on fracking if she were to disavow her old position and explain to voters that experiences in the White House -- such as seeing how global energy markets were impacted by the Ukraine war -- led her to change her mind, McHenry explained to the DCNF.\n\nFracking is a technique for extracting oil and gas from certain underground rock formations, and it enabled a natural gas boom in the U.S., with American natural gas consumption increasing by approximately 40% between 2000 and 2023 as the U.S. became the global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Biden administration decided in January to freeze approvals for new LNG export terminals, a move that critics say was meant to appease climate-focused voters and deep-pocketed environmental interests ahead of an election.\n\n\"Climate change and banning fracking were CENTRAL to her 2020 campaign! I mean, she went on the Tonight Show and performed a song about it! Nobody is going to believe anything other than she's a climate cultist,\" Scott Jennings, a political strategist and an on-air pundit for CNN, told the DCNF. \"She's the Greta of the U.S. government, and that ought to scare the bejeezus out of every energy worker in Pennsylvania and any American who would suffer under her obviously radical views.\"\n\nHarris has already racked up endorsements from major, deep-pocketed environmental organizations that oppose fracking just weeks after announcing her candidacy. Meanwhile, two of the more radical groups in the environmentalist movement -- the Sunrise Movement and Climate Defiance -- have so far withheld official endorsements.\n\n\"If I'm looking at the options around the election this November, there's a lot of ways in which Kamala Harris will be immensely easier to pressure and change on that than a Donald Trump presidency would,\" Aru Shiney-Ajay, the Sunrise Movement's executive director, told reporters Monday, according to Politico.\n\nClimate Defiance, which has protested against Harris with one of its disruptive demonstrations, has made demands for Harris to meet to demonstrate that she is a candidate who can \"usher in an era of equity and sustainability.\" The demands include ensuring that there is no more oil and gas infrastructure development and ending oil and gas leasing on federally-controlled lands and waters.\n\nThe political and electoral ramifications of Harris' fracking flip-flop could be most visible in Pennsylvania, a huge natural gas producer and a crucial swing state in the 2024 cycle. Former President Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania in 2016 by a tight margin before losing it to Biden in 2020 in another close race; the state figures to be hotly-contested again in 2024, according to McHenry, with a new poll from Susquehanna Polling showing Harris up on Trump by four percentage points with 7% of respondents unsure who they will back in November.\n\nPennsylvania produced more natural gas than any state other than Texas in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the natural gas industry directly or indirectly supported about 123,000 jobs in the state as of 2022, according to an August 2023 report prepared by FTI Consulting for the Marcellus Shale Coalition.\n\n\"Going back on her 2019 comments about banning fracking or abolishing the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal doesn't change the facts that the Biden-Harris administration paused the expansion of LNG exports, exacerbated our looming reliability crisis with subsidized unreliable weather-dependent energy sources with the Inflation Reduction Act, and allowed federal agencies to over-regulate every coal and natural gas power plant in the nation providing reliable and affordable energy,\" Andr\u00e9 B\u00e9liveau, senior manager of energy policy for the Commonwealth Foundation, told the DCNF. \"Harris can backpedal on her 2019 comments all she wants, but her record from the last four years is clear.\"\n\nDave McCormick, the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, is already running an advertisement attacking Harris' energy positions and tying together the vice president and his opponent, incumbent Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey.\n\nSome pundits have suggested that Harris could mitigate risks she may face in Pennsylvania by picking Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate. However, selecting Shapiro could cause problems for Harris in other states and isolate voting blocs she needs to win due to his support of Israel and criticisms of pro-Palestinian activists, McHenry told the DCNF.\n\n\"Bob Casey and Kamala Harris have opposed Pennsylvania energy every step of the way, and their anti-fossil fuel agenda would be disastrous for our commonwealth and the 600,000 workers who rely on the energy sector for a paycheck,\" McCormick said in a statement shared with the DCNF. \"Banning fracking and abolishing the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal may be popular among the far-left, but here in Pennsylvania these radical proposals are radically out of step with the needs of working families.\"\n\nThe Harris and Casey campaigns did not respond immediately to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Following a short bump, Harris plummeted down a cliff in the polling average chart until she eventually dropped out.\n\nBy the end of the campaign, relations between Harris and her then-campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, had turned sour, and staffers and aides began blaming Harris for what was ultimately a failed run, the New York Times reported. On its last legs in late 2019, the campaign was in financial disrepair and marred by internal factions and finger-pointing.\n\n\"You can't run the country if you can't run your campaign,\" former Harris aide Gil Duran, who is now an editor at the San Francisco Chronicle, told the outlet.\n\nWATCH -- Michigan Auto Worker: \"America's Done for\" if Harris Wins:\n\nHarris's sister, Maya Harris, who was the campaign chairwoman, seemed to drive tension as she would go \"unchallenged,\" per the Times. Harris also caught criticism from advisers for haphazard attacks on rivals.\n\nThe article, which came days before Harris announced the end of her bid, stated that \"aides said it's unclear who's in charge of the campaign.\"\n\nAside from dysfunction and an apparent lack of leadership and direction, another major issue that sunk Harris was voters' confusion regarding where she stood on issues, as Politico reported at the time:\n\nThroughout the campaign, Harris had never been steady on health care, many voters' stated key issue. Harris had to backtrack following an ill-fated moment in a CNN town hall in which she said, \"let's eliminate all that,\" when asked whether she supported a health care plan that got rid of private insurance.\n\nHer stumbles on the issue continued into the fall, as Harris waffled on whether she backed the kind of single-payer, \"Medicare for All\" plan championed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, or more incremental change.\n\nIn addition to health care, voters complained that they were unable to pin Harris down on a host of other issues.\n\nWATCH -- CNN's Sellers: GOP Doesn't Know How to Deal with Harris Because She Changes Positions:\n\nHarris is taking a second swipe at the presidency after a successful behind-the-scenes pressure campaign from top Democrats, Hollywood elites, and donors to force out President Joe Biden as the nominee. But she is still haunted by her disastrous 2020 run. Republicans, ranging from the Make America Great Again Inc. PAC to Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick, have already released ads exposing Harris's record via videos and interviews from her last bid.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_gilbertson@breitbart.com", "name": "Nick Gilbertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maya Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-payer healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/AP20219057006967.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775670", "eventUri": "eng-9775670", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 323, "textEnd": 332}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

From her past support of Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and Black Lives Matter, to her backing an assault weapons buyback program and the reconstruction of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement federal agency from \"scratch\" as recently as five years ago during her 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Harris's record provides the GOP with an opportunity to turn persuadable independents, disenchanted Democrats, and disaffected Republicans against her.\n\nCalifornia Republican strategist Duf Sundheim, who will likely vote for Harris over Trump, described the GOP criticism of Harris as \"liberal\" as \"the right move,\" dismissing the likelihood it will have the unintended consequence of encouraging more Left-leaning Democrats to coalesce behind her.\n\n\"It is going to force the Harris campaign to decide whether to allow 'Harris to be Harris,' which is too liberal for swing states or to have her tack to the middle,\" Sundheim told the Washington Examiner. \"She is much more comfortable when advocating [for] liberal change.\"\n\n\"Bob Casey just endorsed the most liberal nominee in U.S. history,\" McCormick posted on social media earlier this week.\n\nA California Democratic strategist disagreed, contending the liberal criticism is \"so overused and predictable\" that it has \"become juvenile pablum.\"\n\n\"The Harris campaign should keep doing exactly what they are doing,\" the strategist told the Washington Examiner.\n\nTo that end, the Harris campaign has been trying to balance countering the liberal criticism, by walking back her past positions and embracing Biden's own record, with the need to reintroduce her to the public by underscoring her work experience as a San Francisco district attorney, a California attorney general, and a Golden State U.S. senator. As a result, Harris no longer supports Medicare for All or a buyback program and backs fracking, in addition to surging resources to the border.\n\n\"Vice President Harris spent her career as a prosecutor who took on predators and fraudsters and stood up to big banks on behalf of middle class families -- it's why convicted felon Donald Trump is scared to debate her, and why his campaign is lying about her record,\" Harris campaign spokeswoman Sarafina Chitika told the Washington Examiner. \"The facts are clear: Vice President Harris has been a key leader in working across the aisle to pass the Biden-Harris administration's historic, popular agenda, including landmark bipartisan bills to rebuild our roads and bridges and keep our communities safe from gun violence.\"\n\nAt the same time, some Democrats acknowledge the liberal criticism could become problematic for Harris. For instance, preliminary public opinion research from Democratic polling firm Blueprint found the word most commonly associated with the vice president was \"liberal.\" Although other top choices were positive, others included \"out of touch,\" \"Leftist,\" and \"extreme.\"\n\nBlueprint lead pollster Evan Roth Smith had this advice for the Harris campaign regarding its message: \"Don't burden it with ideological stuff.\"\n\n\"'She's a pragmatic. She's a bold progressive.' Nope, doesn't work,\" Roth Smith told reporters last week. \"Give me the policy. Give me the breath of fresh air. Give me champion of the middle class. Give me reproductive freedom. Give me a change in our political system.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump campaign is downplaying Harris as \"just as incompetent\" as Biden and \"even more liberal, and Americans of all ages are worse off thanks to her failed record.\"\n\n\"She was the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for Joe Biden's most disastrous policies,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner. \"Not only does Kamala need to defend her support of Joe Biden's failed agenda over the past four years, she also needs to answer for her own terrible weak-on-crime record in California. A vote for Kamala is a vote to allow illegal immigrants from all over the world to invade our country, a vote to defund the police, abolish ICE, and bail violent criminals out of jail.\"\n\nWhile Harris has experienced an immediate bump in polling and donations, undercutting Trump's lead after an assassination attempt, Republicans have discounted the bounce as a honeymoon period before voters better understand her liberal record. Regardless, the GOP does retain one advantage. According to Marquette Law School Poll Director Charles Franklin, \"there are more conservatives than liberals nationally\" and \"this has been true for a long time.\"\n\n\"Harris' voting record in the Senate was quite liberal, slightly to the right of Elizabeth Warren but to the Left of all other Democrats when she was in the Senate,\" battleground Wisconsin-based Franklin told the Washington Examiner, alluding to the Massachusetts senator. \"[Harris's] record as a prosecutor and attorney general are less clearly so, but will no doubt be argued about.\"\n\nAnother California Republican, strategist Ron Nehring, implored the GOP to criticize Harris as a \"Leftist\" and not a \"liberal,\" asserting \"Leftist\" is stronger and more accurate.\n\n\"The traditional meaning of the term liberal refers to being free and open, which more accurately describes conservatives today than the woke Left, which won't even tolerate pronouns they don't like, and labels as a 'hater' anyone who believes women's sports should be for... women,\" Nehring told the Washington Examiner. \"In today's polarized society, activists in both parties easily fall into the trap of just echoing terms which work well for people in their camp, but don't work for appealing beyond it. Labeling Harris a 'liberal,' as opposed to other, more persuasive terms, is an example.\"\n\nNevertheless, the liberal criticism of Harris has not been not enough to deter Sundheim, the first California Republican, from voting for the vice president over Trump in 100-odd days, conceding more centrist members of the GOP, including himself, were considering not casting a ballot for Biden again because of his age and mental acuity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSimultaneously, Republicans need to be mindful that the liberal criticism of Harris has emboldened more Left-leaning Democrats, including young people such as Jack Lobel, spokesman for Voters of Tomorrow.\n\n\"Vice President Harris will restore reproductive rights, protect our climate, and build up the middle class,\" Lobel told the Washington Examiner. \"MAGA might call that radical -- we call it fighting for everyday Americans, including young people of all walks of life.\"",

It's been a work in progress.", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House last week presented an opportunity for newly minted presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nIt was only days after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election when the White House decided that after the vice president met with Netanyahu, she would give the administration's public response to his visit. The result was a moment designed to give Harris the foreign policy spotlight and a chance to reset with Democrats who had turned on Biden over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering\" of Palestinians, Harris said after meeting with Netanyahu, \"and I will not be silent.\"\n\nHer words were nearly identical to remarks Biden has delivered in the past, including the assertion that \"Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters.\" They also reflect the overarching posture Harris has struck as vice president -- aligning closely with Biden's agenda, differing more on tone than on substance.\n\nWith Harris set to clinch the Democratic nomination, how she would lead the country as commander in chief remains an open question. Interviews with nearly three dozen current and former U.S. officials who have worked with Harris and her team on foreign policy issues, as well as a review of her voting record in the Senate and her public comments, offer limited clues to how she would respond to some high-stakes national security challenges facing the U.S.\n\nBiden has an extensive foreign policy record from his decades as a senator, vice president and president, and Trump has his own record from serving four years as commander in chief. Harris' lack of a clear record on foreign policy issues -- and no definitive doctrine -- is a marked difference and potentially opens a front in the battle over voters' national security concerns in the 2024 campaign.\n\nCritics say Harris' reticence is a sign that she lacks both a foreign policy vision and deep expertise. Supporters say that she treaded carefully because she did not want to disagree openly with Biden and his aides, and that she gained a great deal of foreign policy experience as vice president. One senior aide to the vice president said that instead of having a foreign policy doctrine, the vice president is focused on future challenges like artificial intelligence, climate change and global competition in space.\n\nHarris has kept her views closely held during Situation Room meetings and policy debates, according to more than a dozen current and former administration officials. Her approach was shaped early in her tenure as vice president by what these officials saw as a lack of confidence in her foreign policy chops, particularly when stacked against Biden's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and hardened positions on key issues. Administration officials -- from the Pentagon to the State Department and the White House -- have at times tried to decipher Harris' positions based on questions she asks on specific topics.\n\nFive current and former officials said they believed that distrust of Biden's inner national security circle left Harris concerned that the president's aides would leak details of her comments if she expressed any dissent. Early in the administration she had regular lunches with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to a senior administration official, but the State Department declined to say how long the meetings continued, pointing instead to their consistent engagement at the White House, in the Situation Room and on diplomatic trips overseas. In remarks last month, Blinken referred to Harris as a \"very strong, very effective and effective and deeply respected voice for our country around the world.\"\n\nOfficials close to Harris acknowledge that she was not confident in her knowledge of foreign policy at the beginning of the Biden administration.\n\nThis was evident in her early speeches when she often depended on teleprompters and, when pressed by reporters, didn't seem comfortable with the material. But Biden administration officials who worked closely with Harris said she has worked to turn that around and tried to use Biden's foreign policy experience to her advantage, seeing it as an opportunity to learn from him.\n\n\"Anytime you do a job for multiple years, you get better and better at it,\" one official said, adding, \"nothing else prepares you for this job than doing it.\"\n\nOne of Harris' first high-profile assignments from Biden was to address the root causes of the influx of migrants at the southern border, which Trump is already making a key issue in the campaign. Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with focusing on diplomacy in the region, as she chafed at the idea of being tasked with the politically volatile assignment of broadly overseeing the U.S. border policy. In a new TV ad, the Trump campaign is highlighting Harris' widely criticized response to a question from NBC's Lester Holt in a 2021 interview about her not having visited the border yet. \"And I haven't been to Europe,\" Harris responded.\n\nHarris' chief role on the world stage in the Biden administration has been to help advance the president's policies, which she has largely done with caution and precision. Her public comments are carefully worded and routinely vetted by Biden's top aides. During her remarks on Thursday after meeting with Netanyahu, for instance, Harris mentioned the names of American hostages, a move that had been cleared beforehand with the White House, according to one current and one former official.\n\nThe minimal differences between Harris and Biden on foreign policy have played out privately over the president's decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan and, more recently, in public over the war in Gaza. When discussing both conflicts, Harris has emphasized their humanitarian challenges first, then affirmed the overarching U.S. policy -- on Gaza it's a commitment to Israel's right to defend itself, and on Afghanistan it was a decision to end the war -- while Biden has been inclined to do the reverse.\n\n\"The vice president has shown empathy on issues related to women and kids, but while she may have a different tone and emphasis, the message and policy is the same as the president's,\" a former administration official said.\n\nWhile Harris aides say she strongly supported Biden's decision to end the war in Afghanistan, pointing out she said publicly that he had \"made the courageous and right decision,\" privately she had stressed concerns about what the withdrawal would mean for Afghan women and children. She has raised similar questions about the dire humanitarian situation for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nBut she hasn't approached either issue in a dissenting way, according to officials.\n\nOn Israel, officials said she was quicker than Biden to strike a balance between firmly backing Israel and expressing concerns about the deaths of Palestinians. In a speech in December in Dubai, Harris said Israel needed to do more to safeguard civilians in Gaza, the sharpest and highest-level criticism of Israel from the administration at that point.\n\nIn March during remarks at a church in Selma, Alabama, Harris delivered the same message Biden had two days earlier -- calling for an immediate cease-fire in exchange for the release of hostages held by Hamas and describing the suffering of Palestinians as unacceptable. But her emphasis was first on the Palestinians and her tone was more impassioned than the president had been. She also had a lively audience, whereas Biden delivered his statement in monotone remarks in the Oval Office.\n\n\"People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane. And our common humanity compels us to act,\" Harris said at the time, later adding that \"Israel has a right to defend itself. And President Joe Biden and I are unwavering in our commitment to Israel's security.\"\n\nStill, the impression Harris has left is that she would be less inclined to embrace Israel as closely as Biden has.\n\n\"It's a very big generational difference,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, a left-of-center political advocacy group that calls itself \"pro-Israel\" and \"pro-peace.\"\n\n\"She brings a perspective that is much more in line with where most of the Democratic Party and up-and-coming policymakers and officials are,\" Ben-Ami said.\n\nAfter Harris, who had met Netanyahu only once before on a visit to Israel as a senator in 2017, delivered remarks last Thursday on the war in Gaza, a senior Israeli official criticized her to reporters, accusing her of overly stressing the importance of ending the war.\n\nThe start of Harris' Senate career in January 2017 coincided with the bombshell revelation from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to help Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. Trump publicly rejected the intelligence community's assessment and refused to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAs a new member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Harris for the next three years was immersed in the committee's closed-door, high-stakes investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 election. The experience offered her a crash course in foreign policy, Russian espionage tactics, the potential vulnerabilities of America's democracy and the workings of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nHer tenure on the committee also served as crucial preparation for her eventual role as vice president, when the Biden administration had to grapple with the fallout from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol and then the consequences of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which sparked a major war in Europe for the first time in more than 75 years.\n\n\"It shaped her worldview in terms of the primacy of defending democracy at home and abroad, as well as the importance of multilateralism and alliances,\" said Halie Soifer, who served as Harris' national security adviser in the Senate.\n\nHarris got high marks from intelligence committee members in both parties, and her time as a prosecutor in California proved to be useful training for synthesizing reams of information, investigating adversaries and questioning witnesses, according to Soifer, who is now CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America.\n\nAfter becoming vice president, Harris was not outspoken about her opinions in meetings with Biden's national security team, according to five current and former officials present for various meetings, but she showed up prepared and would ask a barrage of questions that could be skeptical while still aligned with or in support of Biden's positions. Her style is that of a prosecutor, effectively cross-examining national security officials and reserving judgment until she has looked at every angle and examined the evidence.\n\n\"She is very deliberative in her work. She immerses herself in the facts and then makes her own informed decisions,\" Soifer said. \"She will prepare extensively for every discussion, whether it's public facing or not.\"\n\nMultiple people directly involved with the U.S. response to attacks on American forces by Iranian-backed Houthi militia group said Harris was outspoken about the need to respond, though that was the widely held view across the administration. She has also taken a rule-of-law approach to the war in Ukraine, stressing the administration's policy that Russia pay a price for its invasion and seizure of territory.\n\nSome officials said Harris' views could be reflected in those of her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, a former Obama administration national security aide whose views, particularly on Israel, are closer to former President Barack Obama's than Biden's.\n\nIf she wins in November, Harris is expected to put her own team in national security and foreign policy jobs throughout the government.\n\nHer policies would likely for the most part be an extension of the Biden administration's approach to foreign policy, officials said. Harris has been a loyal deputy to Biden on foreign policy, delivering warnings to adversaries and public and private messages to foreign leaders to underscore America's commitment to allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nOne former senior administration official described her approach as \"less debating in the Situation Room and more helping execute the play.\"\n\nHarris has made at least 17 trips to 21 countries during her time in office, from Europe to Africa to the Indo Pacific, according to a vice presidential aide. A senior administration official said she has used that time to develop relationships with foreign leaders meeting most frequently with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines.\n\nYet it is still unclear how she would operate as president or how she would respond to some critical challenges that could arise during the next president's term.\n\nUnanswered questions include whether Harris agrees with Biden's promise to defend Taiwan if it came under attack, or would stick to a more vague stance preferred by previous presidents. It's not clear if Harris favors expanding export controls to block China's access to advanced U.S. technology or would ease some of the tariffs that are hurting industries in the U.S. Biden has refused to further lift restrictions on Ukraine's use of American weapons to allow them to strike deeper into Russian territory, and it's unclear where Harris would stand on that. Similarly, if Israel was prepared to strike Iran's nuclear program, there's no clarity on how Harris would position the U.S.\n\nAn aide to the vice president said Harris \"was deeply engaged in the policy decision-making in early 2021 and strongly supported President Biden's decision to end America's longest war. As she has said, President Biden 'made the courageous and right decision to end this war because we had achieved what we went there to do.' She has been a critical partner to President Biden as they have countered terrorist threats, as seen by their work together to eliminate leaders of al Qaeda and ISIS.\"\n\nThe aide would not provide details of Harris' private advice to the president.\n\nOne possible area of focus for Harris if elected is the Global South, and she could bring more attention to human rights.\n\nAfter the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, in custody in 2022 sparked nationwide protests in Iran, Harris pushed for the international community to unite in support of Iranian women and amplify their message, according to one senior U.S. official. She was the leading voice on the U.S. effort to remove Iran from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the official said.\n\n\"To all of those protesting I say again, we see you and we hear you,\" Harris said in a statement announcing the U.S. intention to work to remove Iran from the commission. \"I am inspired by your bravery, as are people around the world.\"", "source": {"uri":

She aligned herself with climate activists who are dedicated to ending fossil fuels and converting the nation's energy to renewables such as solar and wind.\n\n\"There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,\" Ms. Harris, who built her political career in California, told CNN during her failed 2020 presidential bid. During the same CNN appearance, Ms. Harris endorsed the Green New Deal, an aggressive plan to ban fossil fuels.\n\nMs. Harris said during the interview that if elected president, her top priority to address climate change would be, \"installation and maintenance of wind turbines and solar paneling.\"\n\nNow that she's on track to lead the 2024 Democratic ticket, Ms. Harris backed off her anti-fracking pledge and talks little about ending fossil fuels as she vies for a win in Pennsylvania, one of the most critical of the seven battleground states and where 19 electoral votes are at stake.\n\nNew polls show Ms. Harris running about even with former President Trump in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe fracking flip-flop may throw Ms. Harris a political lifeline in the state, particularly in the rural areas where Democrats have lost ground in recent elections, a pollster observed.\n\nPennsylvania is the nation's number-two producer of natural gas, trailing Texas only slightly.\n\n\"Fracking is an important issue both economically and symbolically for many of the state's rural residents, so being supportive of that industry at least gives voters in those areas -- areas where Democratic presidential candidates have struggled -- a reason not to immediately discount her campaign,\" Berwood Yost, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll, based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said.\n\nPresident Biden won the state by 1 percent in 2020 and former President Trump won it in 2016 by less than 1 percent.\n\nAlong the way, the energy industry has become an increasingly critical part of the Pennsylvania economy, particularly in the state's rural southwest region.\n\nA Pennsylvania analysis produced by the Marcellus Shale Coalition found that the state's natural gas sector supported 123,000 jobs in 2022, contributing more than $41 billion in economic activity and generating $3.2 billion in state and local tax revenue.\n\nThe study, conducted by energy economists at FTI Consulting, calculated that natural gas production royalties paid to extract natural gas on private and government land reached $6.3 billion in 2022.\n\nMr. Trump recently wielded Ms. Harris' anti-fracking pledge over the voters of Pennsylvania, calling into question her new stance.\n\n\"She pledged to abolish fracking,\" Mr. Trump said during a rally last week in St. Cloud, Minnesota. He added, sarcastically, \"That should do well in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nOfficials with Ms. Harris' campaign immediately called Mr. Trump's statement \"false,\" and \"an obvious attempt to distract from his own plans to enrich oil and gas executives at the expense of the middle class.\"\n\nMs. Harris, they said, aligns herself with Mr. Biden, who has not supported fracking as president.\n\nAndre Beliveau, senior manager of energy policy at the Commonwealth Foundation, a Pennsylvania think tank, said state voters may not buy Ms. Harris' shift on fracking. Ms. Harris, he said, has worked alongside Mr. Biden to implement other regulations, policies and laws aimed at ending natural gas production.\n\nMr. Biden and Ms. Harris in April announced a new power plant rule that would limit new natural gas plants by 2040 and in January implemented a temporary halt on exporting liquified natural gas. The Biden-Harris administration has also provided lopsided tax incentives to renewables that have made natural gas less competitive, Mr. Beliveau said.\n\n\"Policies will always speak louder than words,\" Mr. Beliveau said. \"When voters look at what the Biden-Harris administration has done the last four years when it comes to energy policy, they will probably feel similarly.\"\n\nMr. Yost said fracking in Pennsylvania is a geographically divisive issue -- in other words, some residents oppose it out of environmental or safety concerns, but they tend to be those residents who do not rely on the industry for jobs or other economic benefits.\n\nA 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report poll found 57% of swing voters in the state opposed a fracking ban while 39% of swing voters supported a ban.\n\nThere is no guarantee Ms. Harris' reversal on fracking will help her politically, Mr. Yost said. \"Would supporting a fracking ban hurt? Definitely.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susan_ferrechio@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Susan Ferrechio", "type":

With recent additions like term limits for Supreme Court justices and addressing hidden bank fees, Harris is positioning herself as a continuation of Biden's policies with her unique emphasis.\n\nThe rapid pace of the campaign leaves her little time to detail policy ideas, capitalizing instead on broad outlines and trust built with liberal groups.

It worked for me.", "body": "Donald Trump called presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris a \"lunatic\" and a \"liar\" at his first rally since Biden's exit from the race.\n\nDuring my first re-election to Congress, in 1996, my opponent was a beloved local newscaster, smart and personable Connie McBurney. She had been recruited to run against me on the basis of nearly 100% positive name recognition and with promises of lots of financial support. John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, named me one of organized labor's top two targets in order to help the Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives. This was payback for me defeating longtime union supporter Neal Smith, a 36-year incumbent and chairman of an appropriations committee that had been very generous to organized labor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is now facing a well-funded, smart and personable woman with high name recognition. He could learn from my campaign.\n\nMcBurney's weakness was that she had virtually no political experience and was not well versed in policy. She did not want to debate the issues and was advised to rely on media attack ads. Our problem was how to show she was not up to the job without appearing mean or condescending, a turnoff to women voters. This required a series of television and radio ads bolstered by my frequent speeches asking, \"Where is Connie McBurney?\" A woman supporter with a distinctive voice hammered away in radio ads, asking just what her positions were on various issues.\n\nI was always courteous. No name calling, no questioning of intelligence, no ad hominem attacks. Simply, a smile and shrug, \"We just don't know where she's at.\" This got across the idea that she was shallow on the issues and mainly a front for her handlers who protected her, kind of early basement strategy like we saw from President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump should not resort to name-calling against Harris\n\nTrump has a little different problem but with the same danger. Kamala Harris didn't graduate from an Ivy League school and didn't pass the bar exam on her first try. However, she is not a dumb lunatic. She is plenty savvy and showed a strong debate performance in taking on Biden in a 2020 primary debate. There was no word salad in her attack on Biden when she accused him of past racist positions. To be sure, she has given roundabout, repetitive, almost nonsensical answers to unscripted questions in the past, but with the teleprompter, careful scheduling and preparation for difficult questions, you aren't going to see that in the coming weeks.\n\nTrump doesn't need to say she is dumb or crazy or give her a nickname. I couldn't get McBurmey to debate positions. But Trump has a cornucopia of material on positions Harris has taken that are way out of the mainstream. He can point out in a few sentences where she said this or that and to whom. If he wants to label those positions \"crazy,\" fine. However, he must avoid saying she is stupid for holding them. Let her West Coast ultra-liberal positions speak for themselves. When she espoused them in Iowa, she fell flat and dropped out.\n\nWhat Kamala Harris' failed Iowa Caucus campaign tells us about her 2024 presidential bid\n\nOn one issue, though: Harris is very much like McBurney in not giving an answer. That is abortion. Last year on \"Face the Nation,\" CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan repeatedly asked Harris at what week abortions should be limited, if any: \"What is it you believe? I mean what week of pregnancy should abortion access be cut off?\" Harris would only say she was for Roe v. Wade but five times avoided conceding there should be limits.\n\nOn other issues, Harris has been clear and there is plenty of documentation in her own words. She would eliminate private health care. She co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders' bill that \"would abolish private health insurance for all age groups, including Medicare beneficiaries and replace it with a government single payer system.\" She would provide free health care to illegal immigrants: \"I'm opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health, period.\" Even her boss, Biden, opposed giving free health insurance to undocumented immigrants.\n\nShe supports less funding for police. As a U.S. senator she was asked on ABC if she supported the Los Angeles mayor's plan to relocate $150 million from the police department and replied, \"I support investing in communities so they become more healthy and therefore more safe.\" Asked at a 2019 CNN climate change town hall if she was in favor of reducing the consumption of red meat, she said, \"Yes, I would.\" She didn't advocate eliminating it totally, but wouldn't say how far she would go in authorizing government regulations to reduce red meat consumption, or how that would affect our cattle industry.\n\nAs a 2020 presidential candidate, Harris pledged to ban fracking. As California attorney general she even sued the Obama administration over its plan to allow fracking off the California coast.\n\nOn her watch as a lead point person for Biden on illegal immigration and the lack of border security that has allowed millions of people into our country without authorization, Biden asked her to tackle \"root causes\" of migration. News organizations labeled her the immgration czar. In response she initially talked to the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to induce them, by increased foreign aid, to keep their people in their own countries. She did tell would-be immigrants, \"Do not come!\" but, as the president of a nonpartisan immigration think tank said, \"she just hasn't stayed engaged diplomatically on this,\" dropping the ball. She actually created a \"root cause\" by offering free access to the U.S. health system with a promise there would be minimal legal consequences for illegal entry.\n\nTrump should win if he resists personal attacks and focuses on Harris' record\n\nThese are but a few examples of Harris being out of touch with most of America. My advice to Trump is to remain factual. There is no need to exaggerate her positions or to impugn her personally. Let her past words and positions speak for themselves.\n\nWhen I gave my endorsement speech for Gov. Ron DeSantis at my Iowa caucus precinct, I warned.that Trump would probably beat Biden in a head-to-head race, but, also, that there was a good chance he would face someone fresher, younger and a better debater than Biden.\n\nWell, the Democrats saw a Biden loss as probably catastrophic and dumped Biden for Harris. Call it a coup, it doesn't matter. I predict that Trump will be re-elected, but only if he stops the personal attacks against Harris and focuses, with facts backed up by her own statements and paper trail, about where Harris wants to lead the country.\n\nHer views may represent California, but not Iowa and most of the country.\n\nBy the way, the name-calling goes both ways. Just because Republicans think we should secure our border and not allow non-citizens to vote does not mean that we are racists or fascists. How about some civility and respect for our fellow citizens' views even if they differ from our own?", "source": {"uri": "desmoinesregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Des Moines Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ad hominem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL\u2013CIO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFL\u2013CIO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_ad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attack ad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa caucuses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It's seldom that one position is going to decide to race.\"\n\nRepublicans have labeled Harris \"too liberal\" to be president, attacking her 2020 campaign platform, which was to the left of then-candidate Biden's.

While that is narrower than the seven point lead Trump had over Joe Biden, it is hardly the explosion of popularity you might expect from the ebullient reaction from Democratic partisans and their allies in the establishment media.\n\nKeep in mind that Republicans have lost the popular vote in all but one election since 2000. So, Harris being just behind Trump 100 days before the election means Trump is in a strong position.\n\nThere's no realistic path to victory for Harris if she loses the popular vote -- and the odds are against her even if she makes up the distance. Nate Silver's modeling currently gives Harris a 53.5 percent chance of winning the popular vote -- and only a 38.1 percent chance of winning the electoral college and the presidency.\n\nHarris is rapidly attempting to run away from her own positions. Campaign officials have anonymously leaked that Harris would no longer support a national ban on fracking -- a ban she had unequivocally endorsed in the past. Aides have also said she does not support looking into the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or banning private health insurance in favor of \"Medicaid for All.\"\n\nThese flip-flops have so far not come from the mouth of the candidate herself but from aides, often speaking anonymously. It's easy to see why Harris might be hesitant to repudiate her positions. They are very popular with small but influential segments of her party. The Green New Dealers will not be pleased to hear that she now supports fracking and fossil fuel production -- unless they can be convinced that she doesn't really mean it.\n\nThis is a tricky game. On the one hand, Harris needs to convince voters in Pennsylvania that she really has changed her mind on fracking. Without a thorough explanation of what brought about this shift, such claims are likely to be viewed with suspicion. On the other hand, her campaign hopes that the green-left will see this as a cynical ploy to win votes and not actually an indication of what direction policy would take under a Harris administration.\n\nThe deeper problem for Harris, however, is that she was one of the biggest cheerleaders for \"Bidenomics.\" This was a term that was originally deployed by critics of the Biden administration's economic policies and later adopted by the White House and its supporters. The hope was that the term Bidenomics could be co-opted into a positive, much the way \"deplorable\" was adopted by Trump's supporters and turned against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe flaw in this strategy is that the public really dislikes their current economic circumstances. By accepting the label Bidenomics to describe it, the White House was actually complicit in tying economic pessimism and dissatisfaction to President Biden. And by deploying Harris to promote Bidenomics, they wrapped her in its mantel of negativity as well.\n\nA few months ago, many Democrats held out hope that the public's view of the economy would change. They convinced themselves that what they saw as \"objective\" data signaling a strong economy -- mostly low unemployment and falling inflation -- would be reflected in public opinion before election day. Back in February, Nate Silver wrote in the New York Times that improvements in objective data were likely to be tracked by improvements in subjective consumer sentiment. That, in turn, \"leaves the door open for a potential second Biden term.\"\n\nBut that has not happened. Consumer sentiment has worsened in the intervening months. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment began the year with a 79 reading. That turned out to be the peak. It has now fallen for four consecutive months. The final July survey showed it plunging to 66.4.\n\nOther surveys tell a similar story. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence stood at 114.8 in January and had fallen to 97.8 last month. It improved to 100.3 in July, but that was entirely due to an improvement in the expectations part of the survey -- which was likely boosted by Republicans gaining confidence that they would return Trump to the White House. The index of current conditions fell in July, meaning people think the economy got worse.\n\nThis was Biden's biggest obstacle to re-election, and it is now Harris's.\n\nIt likely will not be enough for Harris to renounce the far left positions that made her popular while she was a rising star in California politics. She will need to convince voters that she offers a fundamentally different economic agenda than the one enacted by the Biden administration -- without alienating the Democrats who joined her in applauding that agenda for the past four years.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_carney@breitbart.com", "name": "John Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_the_Joe_Biden_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nate Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/joe-biden-kamala-harris-2-27-23-flickr.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775670", "eventUri": "eng-9775670", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

They are deep into reinventing the presumptive Democrat nominee, lying about her background, removing damaging evidence of her hard-core leftism and presenting to the world, like a proud mom showing off her newborn, a fresh and unsullied face.\n\nIntroducing Immaculate Kamala, an entirely fabricated creation of the left-wing media.\n\nConfused voters must be wondering: why has Kamala Harris been judged one of the most unpopular vice presidents in history? How is it that Democrat kingmakers reportedly conspired for months to eject her from the ticket?\n\nThe liberal media is good at this, and have turned the political conversation on its head in just a few weeks. It seems like yesterday that Donald Trump was cruising to victory in November - some were talking\"landslide.\" The disastrous debate which revealed Joe Biden's incapacity, the attempt on the former president's life, his brave response and a stunningly effective convention showed the GOP united, for once, and poised to clobber the incumbent.\n\nBut now we read the polls are tightening, Harris is hauling in big campaign bucks, rebuilding the Obama coalition, and strengthening her grip on young, female and minority voters. We also read that Republicans are distorting her record. Voters disgusted by the failures of the Biden-Harris administration over the past three and a half years are being told their judgment (and recollections) about Harris are wrong, that she had little influence over decision-making in the White House.\n\nDon't believe it. The New York Times, et al. may be doing their darndest to polish up Kamala Harris, but voters are not fooled. The vice president still earns deeply negative favorability ratings, worse than Donald Trump's. The Real Clear Politics average of polls show 42% of respondents view Harris positively, while 50% give her an unfavorable rating. True, those numbers have improved in recent weeks, thanks to the massive outpouring of flattering press, but they are still (slightly) worse than those earned by Donald Trump, invariably dubbed \"wildly unpopular\" by the left-wing media.\n\nSome of the air-brushing is downright funny. The New York Times just published a piece about Kamala's laugh, the notorious cackle that rivals nails on a chalkboard. The author, Jason Zinoman, dismisses the carping about Kamala's laugh, writing, \"This rests on a common misunderstanding that laughter is primarily a response to something funny.\" Hmmm.\n\nThe Times' \"comedy critic\" concludes that \"far from a liability\" the laugh is \"one of her most effective weapons.\"\n\nTell that to NBC's Lester Holt, who asked Harris whether she had visited the border and elicited hilarity instead of explanations from the clueless vice president. The clip of that damning interview is one of the most watched episodes in Harris' career; the laugh is what tells us she is not a serious person.\n\nOf course, Zinoman ultimately falls back on the charge that criticizing Harris' cringe-making guffaws is sexist. Expect that to be the rallying cry in coming months: critical comments about Harris are sexist or racist, or likely both.\n\nAnother Times piece, titled \"Here's What Global Leaders Say About Kamala Harris\" reveals the cleverness of the liberal media's reinvention efforts. The lead-in reads, \"Heads of state and diplomats who have interacted with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee say she uses humor, and talk of food, to help leaven hard discussions.\" This is so utterly perfect: Harris is portrayed as likable, approachable (she talks about food -- just like any woman!) but steely underneath - ready to take a tough line with foreign leaders. The reality - buried deep in the piece, is that \"Ms. Harris did not emerge as a key point person for global leaders.\"\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg delivered a podcast recently saying it was a \"bad look\" for Republicans who criticize Kamala Harris as a DEI hire, and also \"unimaginative.\" He's right. Harris can be attacked on many fronts, and not just that she is a lightweight who was added to Joe Biden's ticket because she was female and Black.\n\nHarris should be attacked for being a San Francisco progressive who supports full-term abortion on demand and advocates decriminalizing illegal immigration, a deceitful politician who lied to the American people about Joe Biden's health and mental acuity and panders to Hamas terrorists in a sickening effort to win Muslim votes in Michigan. She should be called on her support for the George Floyd rioters, her determination to ban fracking and offshore drilling and her enthusiasm for Joe Biden's ever-expanding welfare state.\n\nMost importantly, she has been a hands-on member of the Biden-Harris administration, which has earned the lowest marks of any White House in modern times.\n\nKamala Harris was right beside Joe when he signed off on trillions of dollars in excess government spending, which ignited inflation and drove down our standard of living. She was, by her own telling, the last person in the room and 100% on board when Joe decided to pull the plug on our engagement in Afghanistan, leading to one of the most humiliating chapters in this country's history. And she was - absolutely -- the \"border czar\" who allowed more than 10 million people to flood across our border illegally.\n\nThese issues will decide the November election in Donald Trump's favor. The left-leaning media will do everything possible to shield the real Kamala Harris, but Americans will decide: do they really want four more years of Biden-Harris?", "source": {"uri":

And there are reams of videos showcasing her extremist views across the board, fracking, defunding police, abortion, amnesty for illegals, socializing medicine.\n\nBut then the Times manages to sabotage its own reporting with this line: \"video clips of her old statements and interviews are being weaponized as Republicans aim to define her as a left-wing radical who is out of step with swing voters.\" (emphasis added)\n\nSeriously? Showing video clips of Harris when she last ran for president constitutes \"weaponizing\" them?\n\nThis is from the same people who routinely misquote Donald Trump, make up quotes entirely, or try to spin something Trump said as a joke into a national crisis.\n\nIn any case, Republicans aren't weaponizing anything. They are just doing what reporters should be doing, but won't - informing the public about a person who completely flamed out in her first run for president and whom Biden picked as running mate solely to meet his self-imposed quota.\n\nIn a normal presidential campaign, pressing a candidate to justify, defend, or explain away previously expressed views is precisely what the press would do. They're doing that right now to J.D. Vance.\n\nSo, does Harris still want to ban fracking? If not, why not? Does she want to ban private insurance? Does she still think it's appropriate to laugh about constitutional limits on presidential powers? What changed her mind? And, if she's changed her position on all these issues for political expediency, why should voters trust that she won't do so again if elected?\n\nBut, then again, Harris is a Democrat, so instead of vetting her, the media feel compelled to act like the political equivalent of Secret Service bodyguards, throwing their own reputations in front of Harris to protect her from harm.\n\nThankfully, voters have other ways of getting information than the New York Times, which is something the Times' reporter tacitly admits when he quotes Brad Todd, a Republican strategist and ad maker, saying: \"The archive is deep. We will run out of time before we run out of video clips of Kamala Harris saying wacky California liberal things.\"\n\nThe Times goes on to say that \"the Harris campaign will rebut most of Republicans' attacks by arguing that they are exaggerating or lying about her record.\"\n\nIn other words, showing Kamala saying outrageous things will be dismissed by the campaign as cheap fakes, just as the White House dismissed video clips of Biden's zombie-like actions as cheap fakes before his career-ending debate.\n\nYou can bet the rest of the media, including the Times itself, will obediently fall in line behind that bit of propaganda. By dismissing these clips as \"weaponized\" or \"cheap fakes\" or \"exaggerations,\" the press won't have to bother asking Harris about them at all.", "source": {"uri": "ruthfullyyours.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ruthfullyyours.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_king@ruthfullyyours.com", "name": "Ruth King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It worked for me.", "body": "During my first re-election to Congress, in 1996, my opponent was a beloved local newscaster, smart and personable Connie McBurney. She had been recruited to run against me on the basis of nearly 100% positive name recognition and with promises of lots of financial support. John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, named me one of organized labor's top two targets in order to help the Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives. This was payback for me defeating longtime union supporter Neal Smith, a 36-year incumbent and chairman of an appropriations committee that had been very generous to organized labor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is now facing a well-funded, smart and personable woman with high name recognition. He could learn from my campaign.\n\nMcBurney's weakness was that she had virtually no political experience and was not well versed in policy. She did not want to debate the issues and was advised to rely on media attack ads. Our problem was how to show she was not up to the job without appearing mean or condescending, a turnoff to women voters. This required a series of television and radio ads bolstered by my frequent speeches asking, \"Where is Connie McBurney?\" A woman supporter with a distinctive voice hammered away in radio ads, asking just what her positions were on various issues.\n\nI was always courteous. No name calling, no questioning of intelligence, no ad hominem attacks. Simply, a smile and shrug, \"We just don't know where she's at.\" This got across the idea that she was shallow on the issues and mainly a front for her handlers who protected her, kind of early basement strategy like we saw from President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump has a little different problem but with the same danger. Kamala Harris didn't graduate from an Ivy League school and didn't pass the bar exam on her first try. However, she is not a dumb lunatic. She is plenty savvy and showed a strong debate performance in taking on Biden in a 2020 primary debate. There was no word salad in her attack on Biden when she accused him of past racist positions. To be sure, she has given roundabout, repetitive, almost nonsensical answers to unscripted questions in the past, but with the teleprompter, careful scheduling and preparation for difficult questions, you aren't going to see that in the coming weeks.\n\nTrump doesn't need to say she is dumb or crazy or give her a nickname. I couldn't get McBurmey to debate positions. But Trump has a cornucopia of material on positions Harris has taken that are way out of the mainstream. He can point out in a few sentences where she said this or that and to whom. If he wants to label those positions \"crazy,\" fine. However, he must avoid saying she is stupid for holding them. Let her West Coast ultra-liberal positions speak for themselves. When she espoused them in Iowa, she fell flat and dropped out.\n\nWhat Kamala Harris' failed Iowa Caucus campaign tells us about her 2024 presidential bid\n\nOn one issue, though: Harris is very much like McBurney in not giving an answer. That is abortion. Last year on \"Face the Nation,\" CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan repeatedly asked Harris at what week abortions should be limited, if any: \"What is it you believe? I mean what week of pregnancy should abortion access be cut off?\" Harris would only say she was for Roe v. Wade but five times avoided conceding there should be limits.\n\nOn other issues, Harris has been clear and there is plenty of documentation in her own words. She would eliminate private health care. She co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders' bill that \"would abolish private health insurance for all age groups, including Medicare beneficiaries and replace it with a government single payer system.\" She would provide free health care to illegal immigrants: \"I'm opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health, period.\" Even her boss, Biden, opposed giving free health insurance to undocumented immigrants.\n\nShe supports less funding for police. As a U.S. senator she was asked on ABC if she supported the Los Angeles mayor's plan to relocate $150 million from the police department and replied, \"I support investing in communities so they become more healthy and therefore more safe.\" Asked at a 2019 CNN climate change town hall if she was in favor of reducing the consumption of red meat, she said, \"Yes, I would.\" She didn't advocate eliminating it totally, but wouldn't say how far she would go in authorizing government regulations to reduce red meat consumption, or how that would affect our cattle industry.\n\nAs a 2020 presidential candidate, Harris pledged to ban fracking. As California attorney general she even sued the Obama administration over its plan to allow fracking off the California coast.\n\nOn her watch as a lead point person for Biden on illegal immigration and the lack of border security that has allowed millions of people into our country without authorization, Biden asked her to tackle \"root causes\" of migration. News organizations labeled her the immgration czar. In response she initially talked to the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to induce them, by increased foreign aid, to keep their people in their own countries. She did tell would-be immigrants, \"Do not come!\" but, as the president of a nonpartisan immigration think tank said, \"she just hasn't stayed engaged diplomatically on this,\" dropping the ball. She actually created a \"root cause\" by offering free access to the U.S. health system with a promise there would be minimal legal consequences for illegal entry.\n\nThese are but a few examples of Harris being out of touch with most of America. My advice to Trump is to remain factual. There is no need to exaggerate her positions or to impugn her personally. Let her past words and positions speak for themselves.\n\nWhen I gave my endorsement speech for Gov. Ron DeSantis at my Iowa caucus precinct, I warned.that Trump would probably beat Biden in a head-to-head race, but, also, that there was a good chance he would face someone fresher, younger and a better debater than Biden.\n\nWell, the Democrats saw a Biden loss as probably catastrophic and dumped Biden for Harris. Call it a coup, it doesn't matter. I predict that Trump will be re-elected, but only if he stops the personal attacks against Harris and focuses, with facts backed up by her own statements and paper trail, about where Harris wants to lead the country.\n\nHer views may represent California, but not Iowa and most of the country.\n\nBy the way, the name-calling goes both ways. Just because Republicans think we should secure our border and not allow non-citizens to vote does not mean that we are racists or fascists. How about some civility and respect for our fellow citizens' views even if they differ from our own?\n\nDr. Greg Ganske is a retired reconstructive surgeon who treated children with birth defects, farmers with hand injuries, women with breast cancer and burn patients.

The vice president often cites her mom as an inspiration for her political career.\n\nIt was the late 1950s, and Gopalan was part of one the first waves of Indian immigrants to the United States. \"Anybody with a South Asian background, you'll know that this was early, early, early,\" Harris said, recounting the story in May, at an event with the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies.\n\n\"She arrived in the United States by herself because she had a passion and she had a goal,\" Harris said.\n\nGopalan wanted to cure breast cancer. Her work took her all over the world, doing research in France and Canada. For part of her childhood, Harris lived in Wisconsin because of her mother's job.\n\nIn Oakland, Calif., Gopalan's long hours meant Harris and her younger sister Maya sometimes spent time after school with their downstairs neighbor, Regina Shelton, who ran a daycare center. Harris considers Shelton a second mother. When she was sworn in as vice president, Harris used Shelton's bible.\n\nHarris' father Donald Harris immigrated to the United States from Jamaica, but her parents split up when she was young. Carole Porter, a childhood friend of Harris', says that Gopalan raised her daughters with both cultures, but knew that Kamala and Maya would be seen as Black women.\n\n\"In America, we're considered Black women. And that's how our mothers raised us, because that's what they knew we would be seen as,\" said Porter, who also is biracial. \"Regina Shelton was really helpful and supportive for Shyamala in doing that.\"\n\nIn Harris' first political campaign to become district attorney of San Francisco, her mother was at campaign headquarters every weekend, friends and former staffers of Harris say.\n\n\"Sealing envelopes, making calls -- she did the work -- and making sure all the volunteers had coffee and donuts,\" said Matthew Rothschild, a friend of Harris', who also was close with her mother.\n\nRothschild said Harris inherited her mother's love of cooking, her laugh and her sense of justice.\n\n\"If she ever felt that you weren't being treated right or you were down in the dumps, or there was any injustice in your life or anything, she'd be the first person to call and say, 'Are you okay?'\" he said, describing Gopalan. \"And then she'd be hard to get off the phone, because she wouldn't want to hang up unless she knew you were okay.\"\n\nHarris started at just 8% in the polls in the primary for that district attorney race. In her campaign, she would talk about her mother in speeches - telling the audience about how her mother was five feet tall, but it seemed like she was much taller. It's a line Harris still uses to this day.\n\n\"She's been saying that since 2003,\" Rebecca Prozan, Harris' campaign manager in that race said.\n\nGopalan died of colon cancer in 2009, as Harris was running for attorney general of California.\n\nTen years later, when Harris ran for president the first time, she talked about her own experiences dealing with the health care system when her mother was going through chemotherapy.\n\n\"It is the experience of some doctor talking to you about -- have you heard the term anticipatory grief -- which is the grief that you experience when someone is still here but it weighs on you. The experience of trying to cook for somebody and hope that whatever I make is something you can hold down or you have an appetite for,\" Harris said during an MSNBC town hall in May 2019.\n\n\"The experience of hoping when you're going through chemotherapy that we can give you clothes that are soft enough because your skin is so sensitive. The experience of trying to make sure that the medication on each of the charts actually matches up,\" she said.\n\nIn those months while Harris was running a campaign, and her mother was going through treatment, her friends took shifts to keep Gopalan company at the hospital. Rothschild was one of them.\n\n\"I would come in and sit with her and we would read the paper or watch the news or talk about Kamala,\" he said.\n\nEven then, Rothschild said Gopalan had a sense of humor. He recalled that one day when he went to the hospital, she had put a sign on the door: \"No visitors today. Only the Rothschilds.\"\n\n\"Here she was, she was dying... she had a great sense of humor, even in her pain,\" he said. \"I can see her laughing, with her shoulders moving up and down, sort of the way it does with Kamala.\"\n\nSince becoming vice president, Harris has continued talking about the advice she got her mother.\n\nOne line is the now infamous coconut story, which inspired a wave of emojis on social media that signify support for Harris.\n\n\"I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\" Harris last year, quoting her mother. \"You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"\n\nBut more often, Harris refers back to this line from her mother: Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last.\n\nIt's a line she referenced the night that she and President Biden won the election in 2020:\n\n\"I may be the first woman to hold this office. But I won't be the last.\"", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maya civilization"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Regina, Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Regina, Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Harris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald J.

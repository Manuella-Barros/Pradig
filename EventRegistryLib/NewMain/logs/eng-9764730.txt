Their virtual design projects are quite different from the spied prototypes and the regular ideas of various CGI experts from across the imaginative realm of digital car content creators. Everyone who loves 'America's sports car' has already clearly marked their calendars for July 25, when the General Motors subsidiary Chevrolet will unleash the 2025 Corvette ZR1. It's said to be the most potent Corvette ever, at least until the C8 family also gets the often-rumored and spied Zora version.\n\nThe ZR1 will respect part of tradition - it will be the most powerful ICE-only variant. Other than that, to hell with tradition, actually. First and foremost, like every other C8 iteration, the Corvette ZR1 will obviously get a mid-engine V8 setup. However, unlike the up-to-495-hp Stingray, the record-breaking FPC Z06, or the fresh E-Ray, the new ZR1 won't be naturally aspirated.\n\nInstead, unlike its predecessors, which featured supercharging, it appears that the 2025 C8 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 will have a twin-turbo assembly along with the Z06 engine. The rumor mill speaks of at least 800 horsepower, and in some cases, they even flaunt 850-hp levels, which should allow Zora to top everything with electrification and around 1,000 horsepower to enter the supercar territory.\n\nHowever, stylistically, most outlets - including some dwelling across the parallel universes of vehicular CGI - don't think that Chevrolet will make revolutionary changes to the design of the C8. Sure, it will have more vents, including on the front hood (allegedly), bigger side intakes, a couple of little elements accompanying them, a humongous wing to accompany the classic aerodynamic package, and additional subtle upgrades.\n\nAlas, some say that on the outside, it's going to be easy to mistake the Stingray, Z06, E-Ray, or ZR1 - and that might not tickle everyone's senses. Inside, it's a different matter as most opinions are split between some additional sporty features and a complete revamp of the cockpit that will make the great wall of buttons go away in favor of a large tablet-like central display with touch control.\n\nSo, what happens if you are a Corvette fan and wish for a more clearly designed ZR1 iteration? Well, the answer still comes from fantasy land because Chevrolet seems to go along with the subtle redesign trope. No worries, just before the ZR1's introduction, there are still enough ideas you can alternatively dream about.\n\nCuriously, they are proposed by a couple of pixel masters that have very close-sounding names - Evrim Ozgun and Evren Ozgun - but also different visions for the looks of the 2025 C8 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1. So, take a look at each creation in the video embedded below and tell us which is your favorite - if any.

The King of the Hill - Chevrolet's words, not ours! - is making a comeback. Let's get down to business and start with what everyone will be talking about. It is not the design, it is not the legend, but what lies beneath. The 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 is powered by the twin-turbocharged DOHC flat-plane crank 5.5-liter V8.\n\nCodenamed the LT7 and based on the same architecture as the Z06's LT6 but fitted with twin turbochargers, the power plant pumps out a mind-blowing 1,064 horsepower and 828 pound-feet of torque, while still keeping its rev-happy nature.\n\nThese are the numbers that make it the most powerful engine that has ever worked in a stock Corvette, but also the most powerful V8 ever produced in America and planted into a vehicle by a car manufacturer.\n\nThe LT7 comes with head castings with unique ports and a larger combustion chamber, a completely new intake system tuned for the twin turbochargers, and intelligent anti-lag calibration. The V8 will be hand-assembled at the Performance Build Center, which is part of the Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Kentucky.\n\nThe V8 propels the ZR1 all the way to a top speed of 215 mph (346 kph) and makes it run the quarter mile in a GM-estimated sub-10-second time.\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet To be capable of managing the extra oomph, the eight-speed dual-clutch transmission now sports inner and outer input shaft upgrades, increased gear capacity via peening for all gears, and new oil management, while engineers increased the control valves to accommodate the higher required clutch clamp load.\n\nThe Corvette ZR1 comes with a lot of firsts. It is also the Corvette with the most downforce ever: 1,200 pounds (544 kilograms) at top speed. The aero package includes a standard carbon-fiber front splitter, rocker moldings, side air intake with integrated brake cooling, and front underwing with stall gurney deflectors. Chevrolet installed a flow-through hood, carbon fiber side profile air ducts, and unique fresh air intake ducts.\n\nThere is also an optional ZTK performance package, which brings along a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes, and a tall hood Gurney lip, all made from woven carbon fiber.\n\nThe supercar rides on 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Stiffer springs are part of the plan, and so is a new brake package. The Corvette ZR1 is equipped with carbon ceramic rotor manufacturing technology. The model is capable of going from 80 to 200 mph and back to 80 mph in 24.5 seconds, which is 22% quicker than the C7 ZR1 and 53% compared to the C6 ZR1.\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet General Motors took the car to some of the world's most demanding racetracks for testing, checking the Nurburgring, Road Atlanta, and Virginia International Raceway.\n\nAn iconic design feature is making a comeback with the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1. It is the historic split window, as a tribute to a legendary model. For the design team, the ZR1 felt like the right time to bring the split window back. The last time it was seen was on the C2 Corvette. The Corvette Z06 GT3.R race car also featured it but without all the drums and whistles of a production model.\n\nThe carbon fiber \"spine\" splitting the rear window in two is available in exposed weave or body color to increase heat extraction from the engine compartment.\n\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 also comes with a carbon fiber roof that reduces the weight of the car and lowers the center of gravity. The coupe weighs 3,670 pounds (1,665 kilograms), while the convertible tips the scales at 3,758 pounds (1,705 kilograms).\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet The ZR1 is 185.9 inches (4,722 millimeters) long, 79.7 inches (2,025 millimeters) wide, and 48.6 inches (1,234 millimeters) tall, sitting on a wheelbase of 107 inches (2,723 millimeters).\n\nCustomers will be able to choose one of the four finishes of the unique aluminum wheel design, including the Edge Blue finish. Chevrolet also offers optional carbon fiber wheels.\n\nThe cabin stands proof that Chevrolet wanted to keep the raw, brutal nature of the model, as the cockpit gravitates around the driver. The ZR1 badging shows up on an interior plaque, sill plates, and steering wheel. The driver will also benefit from the presence of a boost gauge, a unique feature for the first factory turbocharged Corvette in the brand's history.\n\nThose interested in driving a Corvette ZR1 home also have the new Corvette lineup paintworks to choose from: the Competition Yellow, Hysteria Purple, and Sebring Orange are on the list. Chevrolet also offers a new Habanero interior with Blue Stitch option.\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet The 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 will go into production in 2025 at GM's Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Kentucky.

The ZR1 now holds the title for the \"fastest and most powerful\" Vette ever produced.\n\nChevrolet's engineers pushed the boundaries of engine architecture with the ZR1, squeezing 1,064 horsepower and 828 lb-ft of torque from the 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8.\n\n\"We didn't know what the final [horsepower] number could be until late in the program. Instead of saying we wanted a specific number, we said we will use all available technology, the best possible hardware, state-of-the-art software and controls systems and we'll see what we get,\" Tadge Juechter, Corvette's executive chief engineer, told ABC News. \"What we got is very impressive ... we didn't leave a single pony on the table.\"\n\nThe engineers earned the bragging rights: They clocked a sub-10-second quarter-mile time on the Corvette ZR1's first launch. Four test drivers even pushed the car past 200 mph on their first laps at the N\u00fcrburgring track in Germany. Corvette detractors will have to finally accept that the American sports car continues to post performance stats that are equal to or better than its European rivals.\n\n\"No one will be able to question the overwhelming performance of the ZR1,\" Juechter pointed out. \"People will look back 50 years from now and remember the C8 ZR1 as a high-water mark for the industry.\"\n\nThe ZR1's exterior design is more striking and aggressive than the base Stingray and the optional ZTK package adds a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes and a tall hood Gurney lip, according to the marque. Head to a local racetrack to burn those Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires: the ZR1 has a top speed of 215 mph. The LT7 V8 is the first twin-turbocharged engine in a factory Corvette.\n\nThe available ZTK package even adds a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes and a tall hood Gurney lip, all of which have been constructed from woven carbon fiber, according to the marque.\n\nCorvette buffs may also appreciate the return of the split window - \"a beloved element from Corvette's history,\" according to Phil Zak, executive design director at Chevrolet. \"Not only does this element provide function, but we were able to integrate passionate design into the form and do it in a way that paid homage to Corvette's history. ZR1 felt like the right time to bring the split-window back.\"\n\nThe car's interior received special attention, too: there's unique ZR1 badging found on an interior plaque, the sill plates and steering wheel. A new finishing stitch pattern for the doors is specific to the car.\n\nCustomers can choose from a long list of exterior colors, including Competition Yellow, Hysteria Purple, and Sebring Orange.\n\nProduction begins in 2025 with pricing details coming later this year. Will more Corvette owners choose the ZR1 over the electrified E-Ray or the raucous Z06 with its naturally aspirated V8 engine? Hard to tell. Juechter, however, argued that the ZR1 won't steal sales from the other Corvette models on the market.\n\n\"We are providing our customers an incredible menu of choices at different price points,\" he noted. \"As long as they are happy, they can order, and we will build whatever they want.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camouflage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_plane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diving plane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stingray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00fcrburgring", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N\u00fcrburgring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebring_International_Raceway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebring International Raceway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/66845603-64ff-47af-a620-da6b451b10d7/corvette-yellow-ht-bb-240725_1721923622508_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

With the first-ever turbocharged V-8 engine in a Corvette, Chevy said it can directly challenge the likes of the Porsche 911 and other six-figure halo cars from import brands.\n\nBrand marketers also are counting on the car -- only the fifth ZR1 over eight generations of the Corvette -- to elevate the rest of Chevy's lineup.\n\n\"We've done a lot of very, very fast cars before, and the ZR1s have always been at the top of the heap,\" Juechter told Automotive News. \"We've been doing internal combustion engines for over 100 years, and you think, 'OK, we'd be sort of topping out about now.' But instead of topping out, we're taking giant steps up.\"\n\nChevy is revealing the ZR1 long before it enters production next year at General Motors' Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Ky., because remaining development work requires testing undisguised prototypes, said Juechter, who will retire this summer after 47 years at the automaker. Pricing will be revealed later.\n\nThat work includes finalizing key specifications, including 0-to-60 mph time and top speed, he said. But engineers have confirmed that the ZR1 will generate 1,064 hp at 7,000 rpm, 828 pound-feet of torque at 6,000 rpm and more than 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed, which is expected to surpass 215 mph. The ZR1's twin turbos are so powerful, in fact, that they stretched the capacity of GM's dynamometers, which had been upgraded specifically to handle the engine during testing.\n\n\"We didn't leave a lot on the table,\" Juechter said.\n\nChevy said the 5.5-liter parallel twin-turbocharged V-8 is the most powerful V-8 engine ever built by an automaker in the U.S., topping the 1,025-hp Hemi V-8 engine in the 2023 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170. Each ZR1 engine will be hand-built and signed at GM's Performance Build Center in the Bowling Green complex.\n\nCorvette engineers developed the ZR1's LT7 engine together with the LT6 supercharged V-8 that powers the Z06. Called the \"Small Block Gemini,\" they share a foundation that includes the flat plane crank architecture and engine block structure, said Josh Holder, the Corvette's vehicle chief engineer. But the intake system, combustion chambers, cylinder head castings and valve ports are unique to the ZR1.\n\nThe Corvette C8's midengine architecture allowed Chevy to package the turbochargers behind the driver, because they physically would not fit in previous generations' front-engine designs, Holder said. It also helped with performance.\n\n\"If we'd put an engine this powerful in the front of a car, it would be no faster because you'd just light up the tires. You wouldn't be able to get forward propulsion out of it. So the more powerful the engine, the greater the advantage of the midengine,\" Juechter said. \"Having that much weight on the back end with those big, wide tires lets us get that power to the ground. And so that changes the driving experience completely, and that makes the car feel manageable. It's a rocket sled, but it's manageable.\"\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive ZR1 will come in coupe and convertible versions. The eight-speed transmission was upgraded to accommodate the increased power, and engineers added multiple features to support cooling and aerodynamics, including spoilers and wings, a flow-through hood and brake cooling ductwork on the rear quarter panel. It has 20-inch wheels in the front and 21-inch wheels in the rear, with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires.\n\nAn optional ZTK package enhances the ZR1's track performance with a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes and a stiffer suspension, Chevy said.\n\nA new brake system employs carbon ceramic rotor technology for improved durability and lower temperatures, with the largest front rotors ever on a Corvette, at 15.7 inches. Chevy said the ZR1 can go from 80 mph to 200 mph and back in 24.5 seconds, which is 22 percent faster than the C7 ZR1 and 53 percent faster than the C6 version.\n\n\"We're going to talk about some pretty blistering speeds when we're done developing this car,\" Holder said. \"There's a whole lot more to this story that I can't wait to share. But the integration of that aerodynamic work, the cooling work that goes along with the engine -- everything has been thought out in a way that every surface is functional.\"\n\nChevy said testing at GM's proving ground in Milford, Mich., has produced a higher top speed than the production C7 ZR1 and a quarter-mile time of less than 10 seconds. Four test drivers each reached more than 200 mph on their first laps at Germany's N\u00fcrburgring.\n\nDesigners have brought back a split rear window for the first time since 1963, when it appeared on the second-generation Corvette for just one year, using a carbon fiber divider that helps with cooling.\n\nCarbon fiber is found throughout the car, from the roof to an optional wheel design exclusive to the ZR1, Chevy said. The carbon fiber roof lowers its mass and center of gravity, while standard aluminum wheels come in four different finishes.\n\nZR1 badging will appear throughout the interior, and customers will be able to customize interior and exterior colors, including multiple new color options. The 3LZ trim will have a leather-wrapped interior and a specific stitching pattern, Chevy said.\n\nChevy plans to use the ZR1 launch to more cohesively market the entire Corvette lineup through new photography and a new website promoting it as a \"family,\" said Brad Franz, Chevrolet cars and crossovers marketing director. Each model is being positioned as a distinct entry: the Stingray, the most accessible Corvette; the Z06, the track-capable version; the E-Ray, the first hybrid option; and the ZR1, the pinnacle of performance.\n\nThe approach one day could be used to promote an electric Corvette. Chevy did not confirm a timeline for one but said the Corvette eventually will go that direction in line with GM's goal of having a fully electric vehicle portfolio. Speculation has swirled that Corvette could become a subbrand of EVs.\n\n\"The family aspect and the lineup aspect and bringing them together was derived to get the vehicle and the brand more organized today,\" Franz said. \"But certainly, you can see extensions from that in the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsay_vanhulle@autonews.com", "name": "Lindsay VanHulle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche 911"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Gemini_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coupe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00fcrburgring", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "N\u00fcrburgring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1024x512/public/ZR1-main_i.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The spotlight is set to shine on the track-focused 2025 Corvette ZR1, a high-octane variant of the acclaimed mid-engine C8. This new ZR1 promises to push the boundaries of aggression, speed, and performance beyond the already impressive C8 lineup. As we gear up for tonight's big reveal, here's a comprehensive roundup of what we know and anticipate about the 2025 Corvette ZR1.\n\nThe 2025 Corvette ZR1 will mark the fifth generation of the storied ZR1 nameplate, poised to deliver an array of jaw-dropping specifications. Central to the excitement is its new engine setup: the ZR1 will debut the twin-turbocharged 5.5L V8 LT7, an evolution of the LT6 engine found in the C8 Z06. Expected to generate approximately 850 horsepower and between 750 and 850 pound-feet of torque, this powerplant will position the ZR1 as the ultimate performance beast in the C8 lineup -- at least until the C8 Zora makes its debut.\n\nPower will be channeled exclusively to the rear wheels through the same eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission co-developed with Tremec, which also equips the C8 Stingray and C8 Z06. Unfortunately, a manual transmission option will not be available for this high-performance variant.\n\nREAD MORE: Koenigsegg's Latest Model 'Jesko Absolute' Set To Break Speed Records: Tests Confirm Capability Beyond 500Kmph!\n\nThe ZR1's exterior design will include a wide body and potentially active aerodynamic elements. Spotted testing at the N\u00fcrburgring, a prototype showcased a commanding rear wing, additional side intakes, and other aerodynamic enhancements. Both a two-door coupe and a hard-top convertible are anticipated.\n\nBeneath its striking exterior, the 2025 Corvette ZR1 will be built on the GM Y2 platform, featuring a specially tuned Magnetic Ride Control suspension to manage its formidable power. Enhanced with larger, more capable brakes, the ZR1 may also offer an optional high-end brake package crafted from an \"exotic material.\"\n\nInside, the ZR1 will largely reflect the design of the C8 Corvette lineup, though it may offer exclusive new seating materials and a massage seat function for added luxury.\n\nThe 2025 Corvette ZR1 will be built on the GM Y2 platform and assembled at the GM Bowling Green plant in Kentucky, continuing the tradition set by the rest of the C8 lineup.\n\nThe highly anticipated debut of the new ZR1 is scheduled for this evening at 7:30 PM EST.

It has a twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter flat-plane-crank V-8 with 1,064 horsepower, 828 pound-feet of torque, and an 8,000-RPM redline. It'll do over 215 miles per hour and conquer a quarter mile in less than ten seconds. And when equipped with the ZTK package, it has over 1,200 pounds of downforce.\n\nGod bless America.\n\nThe new ZR1 is, in other words, a monster. Typically the most powerful car in the 'Vette lineup, it's no surprise this ZR1 is a heavy-hitter. But more than 1,000 hp is a first for the Corvette. The last ZR1 had 755 hp -- a mere 105 more than the next-most-powerful Corvette of the same generation -- and the current Z06 has a measly 670 hp by comparison.\n\nThe ZR1's engine is closely related to the Z06's LT6. Known as the LT7, it shares a block casting and other minor bits with the six. Key components are different, though. The block itself is uniquely machined, new forged pistons contribute to a much lower compression ratio (9.8:1 as compared to the LT6's 12.5:1), as do the all-new heads, and a different crankshaft is added.\n\nThe twin ball-bearing turbochargers are mirror images of each other, featuring single-scroll volutes on the intake side and 76-millimeter compressor wheels. Electronic wastegates enable careful tuning of their behavior, particularly off-throttle to prevent turbo lag. The turbines are also made from a special material called \"MAR,\" which is better than Inconel apparently. News to me.\n\nThis newfound turbo power is sent through a strengthened and retuned version of the eight-speed dual-clutch transmission found in all other C8 Corvettes. Executive Chief Engineer Tadge Juechter explains exactly what makes this powertrain so special:\n\nOther components, like the ZR1's suspension, are similar to lesser C8s. In fact, the ZR1 shares a lot with the Z06 underneath. It's not as hardcore of a track car, but the max downforce-enabling ZTK package means it will tear apart your local circuit. It adds that huge rear wing, front dive planes, and a Gurney lip on the hood. Plus you get stiffer springs with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires.\n\nAs with every other C8, the ZR1 can be had in a coupe or a convertible. And did I mention it has a split rear window for the first time since the 1960s?\n\nThat may sound like a lot of new kit, but thanks to details like carbon fiber wheels and carbon ceramic brake rotors -- both of which are specific to this car -- the ZR1 isn't as heavy as you might think. The coupe version has a dry weight of 3,670 pounds, while the convertible comes in at 3,758 pounds dry. It's shockingly light.\n\nI won't get too far off the beaten path here, but a few other comparisons are justified. The new ZR1 makes 44 more hp than a Tesla Model S Plaid and weighs roughly 1,000 lbs less. The Lucid Air Sapphire, another high-performance EV, makes 170 more hp than the ZR1 -- but the Corvette (dry) weighs a shocking 1,666 lbs less. As far as combustion competition goes, the ZR1 will have a better power-to-weight ratio than the Bugatti Veyron.\n\nDriving the most powerful factory Corvette ever will undoubtedly be nuts, but it will come at a price. Chevy has yet to say how much this car will cost, but it's fair to assume it will be the most expensive 'Vette in history. The old C7 ZR1 was about $120,000 in 2019 dollars (five years ago all of a sudden), and the Z06 already sits at $114,395. If we had to guess, the ZR1 could be close to $150,000. Until we get closer to production in 2025, though, we won't know exactly what it's going to cost.\n\nThere still may be more to come, though. Absent from this car is the E-Ray's front axle hybrid system. Could it be combined with the ZR1's engine? My mind says probably, and my heart says, 'absolutely yes.' While this ZR1 is the most impressive pure-combustion Corvette to date, something tells us it won't be the C8's last laugh.", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Gemini_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coupe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastegate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wastegate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compression ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inconel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_bearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ball bearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring (device)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/RqYArA/s3/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The ZR1 now holds the title for the \"fastest and most powerful\" Vette ever produced.\n\nChevrolet's engineers pushed the boundaries of engine architecture with the ZR1, squeezing 1,064 horsepower and 828 lb-ft of torque from the 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8.\n\n\"We didn't know what the final [horsepower] number could be until late in the program. Instead of saying we wanted a specific number, we said we will use all available technology, the best possible hardware, state-of-the-art software and controls systems and we'll see what we get,\" Tadge Juechter, Corvette's executive chief engineer, told ABC News. \"What we got is very impressive ... we didn't leave a single pony on the table.\"\n\nThe engineers earned the bragging rights: They clocked a sub-10-second quarter-mile time on the Corvette ZR1's first launch. Four test drivers even pushed the car past 200 mph on their first laps at the N\u00fcrburgring track in Germany. Corvette detractors will have to finally accept that the American sports car continues to post performance stats that are equal to or better than its European rivals.\n\n\"No one will be able to question the overwhelming performance of the ZR1,\" Juechter pointed out. \"People will look back 50 years from now and remember the C8 ZR1 as a high-water mark for the industry.\"\n\nMORE: Sales of gas-powered sports cars skyrocket before automakers go electric\n\nThe ZR1's exterior design is more striking and aggressive than the base Stingray and the optional ZTK package adds a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes and a tall hood Gurney lip, according to the marque. Head to a local racetrack to burn those Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires: the ZR1 has a top speed of 215 mph. Under the hood is a LT7 twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the first time a factory Corvette will be built with twin turbos.\n\nThe available ZTK package even adds a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes and a tall hood Gurney lip, all of which have been constructed from woven carbon fiber, according to the marque.\n\nMORE: 1st hybrid Corvette unveiled: What to know about the E-Ray\n\nCorvette buffs may also appreciate the return of the split window - \"a beloved element from Corvette's history,\" according to Phil Zak, executive design director at Chevrolet. \"Not only does this element provide function, but we were able to integrate passionate design into the form and do it in a way that paid homage to Corvette's history. ZR1 felt like the right time to bring the split-window back.\"\n\nThe car's interior received special attention, too: there's unique ZR1 badging found on an interior plaque, the sill plates and steering wheel. A new finishing stitch pattern for the doors is specific to the car.\n\nCustomers can choose from a long list of exterior colors, including Competition Yellow, Hysteria Purple, and Sebring Orange.\n\nProduction begins in 2025 with pricing details coming later this year. Will more Corvette owners choose the ZR1 over the electrified E-Ray or the raucous Z06 with its naturally aspirated V8 engine? Hard to tell. Juechter, however, argued that the ZR1 won't steal sales from the other Corvette models on the market.\n\n\"We are providing our customers an incredible menu of choices at different price points,\" he noted. \"As long as they are happy, they can order, and we will build whatever they want.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camouflage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stingray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00fcrburgring", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N\u00fcrburgring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebring_International_Raceway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebring International Raceway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z_Rbvhlesz52eSRVpEStJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/3063a7bedba50f64948f4fa8c617ab45", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The big surprise isn't the design, which is pretty tame and very close to the C8 Corvette Z06, but rather the output of its V8 - 1,064 horsepower?! Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the age of America's sports car turning into a veritable hypercar. Alternatively, if you're a bit malicious, welcome to the age of $200k Corvette MSRPs with dealer hikes to $350k+. Any way you take it, if these reports pan out at the time of the official reveal (programmed for July 25 at 7:30 PM Eastern time), then we're in for a crazy rollercoaster ride in a few months from now - when a Corvette is not only a supercar but also a hypercar killer.\n\nSo, the Corvette ZR1's latest iteration - part of the C8 family - has been a closely guarded open secret ever since General Motors announced the eighth generation of their sports car would abandon the classic front-engine RWD format in favor of a mid-engine setup. The initial result was the C8 Stingray with up to 495 horsepower thanks to its 6.2-liter LT2 naturally-aspirated V8, which immediately became a fan favorite thanks to its great performance and all-around daily driver features.\n\nSoon, Team Corvette took another step in the right direction with the Z06 iteration - which is powered by a 5.5-liter LT6 flat-plane crankshaft V8 and achieved record-breaking numbers, including 670 horsepower. But that wasn't all - GM introduced the first-ever all-wheel-drive Corvette and the first hybrid performance Corvette with the advent of the E-Ray. It has 655 hp and all-weather capabilities, plus great looks and the same LT2 V8 backed by one permanent magnet synchronous motor.\n\nIf you think that things are getting a little cramped, there's also the ZR1. This one has been talked about and hyped by owners and the rumor mill for as long as the C8 has been around. The parallel universes of vehicular CGI also took a swing at it with help from the imaginative realm of digital car content creators. GM itself put wood on the fire with the latest teasers - and everyone thought they knew what they had coming: a C8 Corvette with more aerodynamic goodies than the Z06 but with essentially the same design plus the 5.5-liter LT6 flat-plane V8 equipped with twin turbos instead of a supercharger, redubbed to LT7 and featuring in excess of 800 ponies.\n\nThey didn't dare to ask for more because a 'Zora' version with E-Ray hybrid credentials is also currently in testing, and that one was expected with more than 1,000 hp to make the Ferrari SF90 Stradale and Lamborghini Revuelto tremble and shake in fear. Well, if we are to believe all the outlets (from TheSuperCarBlog.com to the C8 Corvette Owners (And Friends) group on Facebook), everyone was right in most departments (design, twin-turbo V8, etc.) but also wrong in one key aspect: horsepower.\n\nSomehow, every leak of the yellow 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 also claims the V8 engine will feature no less than 1,064 horsepower! Now, there are three possible scenarios - this specification is bogus, this specification is real, or this specification is somehow mistaken for the ZR1 from Zora. If it's fake, we'll know in a few hours, as well as if this is the HP level of the Zora. But if it's real, it implies that Zora may come with even more power or settle below it and allow the ZR1 to live on as the most extreme derivative of the Corvette series.

It produced 755 horsepower and 715 foot-pounds of torque with a 6.2-liter, V8 supercharged engine.\n\nJuechter said the new ZR1 will \"comfortably\" have a top speed higher than the Corvette's previous top speed of 212 mph.\n\nGM said pricing for the 2025 Corvette ZR1, including an additional \"ZTK\" performance package, will be released closer to when the vehicle goes into production next year. The 2019 Corvette ZR1 started at $121,000.\n\nThe ZR1 joins what GM is calling the \"Corvette family,\" including the \"everyman's sports car\" Corvette Stingray, which starts at about $70,000; the hybrid E-Ray; and the roughly $112,000 Z06 track car.\n\n\"We're happy with the way it's going. This is the next step in that whole approach,\" said Brad Franz, director of Chevy car and crossover marketing.\n\nGM previously confirmed an all-electric Corvette is coming, but it has not given a timeframe. A Corvette SUV also has been under consideration for several years. Franz declined to comment on either vehicle.\n\nWall Street analysts have said GM could better leverage the Corvette brand by expanding models and, to an extent, sales. In late 2019, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said a Corvette sub-brand could be worth between $7 billion and $12 billion.\n\nSales of the Chevrolet Corvette have totaled roughly 34,500 vehicles for each of the past two years. In 2019, the automaker redefined the iconic sports car, swapping its front-engine design for a mid-engine build to increase performance and handling.\n\nModels such as the ZR1 are low-volume vehicles designed to attract buzz to the brand and entice drivers toward less-expensive Corvettes.\n\n\"The ZR1 is the range-topper. It's the halo vehicle. It'll bring tons of attention to the car and actually help sell the other models,\" Juechter said. \"It's part of the ongoing business strategy to keep the product relevant over a relatively long lifecycle.\"\n\nOther performance models have helped to lift Corvette's average transaction price to roughly $106,000.\n\nFranz said price point is expected to continue to rise with the introduction of ZR1 and sales growth of the track-focused Z06, whose average buyer has a household income of $311,000.\n\nAdditional sales of the hybrid Corvette, which starts at about $105,000, also should help boost Corvette's revenue. GM plans to increase production of the E-Ray to 10% of total production capacity from current levels at 2% to 3% currently, Franz said.\n\nThe performance trickle-down effect also has assisted in keeping the sole plant that produces Corvette in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on two shifts since 2019.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-engine,_front-wheel-drive_layout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling Green, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bowling Green, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/108011841-1721924183982-ZR1_performance.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

However, we certainly didn't expect this much power.\n\nBlessed not with an electrified powertrain but rather a twin-turbocharged, 5.5-litre DOHC flat-plane crank LT7 V8, which happens to feature a larger combustion chamber and completely revised intake system, the new 2025 Corvette ZR1 cranks out an insane 1,064 horsepower at 7,000 rpm and 828 lb-ft of torque at 6,000 rpm. It's the most powerful V8 ever produced in America from an auto manufacturer.\n\nBy comparison, the previous-generation ZR1's supercharged 6.2-litre V8 produced 755 horsepower. The current Corvette Z06, which also uses a 5.5-litre V8 but without the dual turbos, delivers 670 horsepower. The gas-electric Corvette E-Ray? Only 655 horsepower.\n\nChevrolet curiously did not reveal 0-60 mph or 0-100 km/h acceleration times, but it did claim a quarter-mile run in less than 10 seconds and a top speed in excess of 346 km/h. By the way, power is still handled by an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission, except that the unit has been reinforced and optimized for the ZR1.\n\nIn order to help the car fulfill its immense potential, engineers fitted a massive carbon fibre wing in the rear that contributes to over 1,200 lbs of downforce at top speed, which is unprecedented in Corvette history. It's part of the optional, track-focused ZTK performance package, which also includes a stiffer suspension and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires.\n\nOtherwise, the standard, more road-focused configuration boasts a sleeker body with lower drag and a small spoiler with customer-adjustable short and tall wickers. It also includes a standard carbon fibre front splitter, rocker mouldings and front underwing with stall gurney deflectors. Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires wrap 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels (carbon wheels are optional). Meanwhile, the front rotors grow to 400 mm in diameter -- the largest ever equipped on the Corvette -- and the rear rotors grow to 390 mm.\n\nOf course, it's impossible not to talk about the return of the iconic split rear window, which was last seen on the second-generation Corvette and quietly previewed on the Corvette Z06 GT3.R race car.\n\n\"We didn't approach this decision lightly, we know this is a beloved element from Corvette's history,\" Executive Design Director Phil Zak said. \"Not only does this element provide function, but we were able to integrate passionate design into the form and do it in a way that paid homage to Corvette's history. ZR1 felt like the right time to bring the split-window back.\"\n\nWhile serving as a statement piece, this carbon fiber \"spine\" between the two rear windows, available in exposed weave or body colour, provides increased heat extraction from the engine bay, working in parallel with numerous other cooling elements throughout the car.\n\nNaturally, customers will have a plethora of options to choose from.

Chevrolet is coming out with a new version for fans who love extra speed on road or track.\n\nThis iconic sports car has a rich history, marked by General Motors' longstanding pursuit of keeping Corvette in the same conversation about speed and performance with the likes of BMW, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Mercedes and Porsche rivals.\n\nChevrolet claims the new ZR1, which goes into production in 2025, is powered by the most powerful V-8 engine ever produced. The 5.5L, twin-turbocharged DOHC flat-plane crank V-8 dubbed the LT7 produces 1,064 hp at 7,000 rpm and 828 lb.-ft. (1,123 Nm) of torque at 6,000 rpm- the most power ever from a factory Corvette.\n\nZR1 boasts an estimated top speed of over 215 mph (346 km/h) on the racetrack and will do a quarter-mile with an estimated sub-10-second time. GM also says the carbon fiber aero package creates over 1,200 lbs. (544 kg) of downforce at top speed.\n\n\"The team that revolutionized Corvette with a mid-engine architecture took on another challenge: take ZR1 to the next level,\" says Scott Bell, vice president, Chevrolet. \"Corvette ZR1 is about pushing the envelope with raw power and cutting-edge innovation. From Stingray, to Z06, E-Ray and now ZR1, the Corvette family continues to elevate with each new iteration - and challenge the best in the world.\"\n\nZR1's V-8 starts with the same architecture as Z06's LT6, which GM claims is the most powerful naturally aspirated production V-8 ever, and then adds twin turbochargers - the first time ever for a factory Corvette. The Chevy engineering team calls the package \"Small Block Gemini\" architecture.\n\nThe LT7 combined with forced induction produces the best performance from the flat-plane-crank V-8, says chief engineer Tadge Juechter.\n\nTo support the huge increase in power from the LT7 engine, Chevy engineers made numerous changes to the Corvette ZR1's 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, including:\n\ninner and outer input shaft upgrades; increased gear capacity with strength increased via shot peening for all gears; and oil management to support increased vehicle longitudinal and lateral capability.\n\nControlling ZR1's high performance is a new brake system. The brake package uses a revolutionary carbon ceramic rotor manufacturing technology to yield increased durability and reduced brake component temperatures.\n\nThe ZR1 will be hand-assembled at the Performance Build Center, part of the Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Kentucky.\n\nThe standard Corvette ZR1 chassis arrives with a sleeker body with lower drag and a small spoiler with customer-adjustable short and tall wickers. It also includes a standard carbon-fiber front splitter, rocker moldings, side intake with integrated brake cooling and front underwing with stall gurney deflectors. Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires wrap 20-in. front and 21-in. rear wheels. The standard chassis blends the best of on-road comfort and track capability with this setup.\n\nBringing back a design element of yore, the rear window is split. Last seen on the C2-generation Corvette and previewed on the Corvette Z06 GT3.R race car, the split window makes a bold statement.\n\nOther exterior and aero features: flow-through hood with air entering the front grille, flowing through the intercooler heat exchanger and exiting the hood to increase front downforce and cool charged air temperatures, and carbon fiber side-profile air ducts with clean, cool air funneling through ducts integrated into the signature wishbone bezel behind the cabin doors to cool the rear brakes. There are unique fresh-air intake ducts: Carbon fiber inlets located on top of the coupe rear hatch ingest air to cool the turbo compressor inlet air temperatures.\n\nThere is an optional performance package for track driving: a downforce rear wing, front-dive planes and a tall hood gurney lip, all constructed from woven carbon fiber. Underneath, underbody strakes replace the standard front underwing stall gurney to increase front downforce. The suspension tuning included in the ZTK package incorporates stiffer springs and adds Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires. Amid testing and development, the ZR1 tackled some the world's most demanding racetracks, including the N\u00fcrburgring, Road Atlanta and Virginia International Raceway.\n\nMaking History\n\nThe story of the Corvette ZR1 begins in the early 1970s, during an era of significant change in the automotive industry. The first ZR1, introduced in 1970, was a performance package for the C3 Corvette. It was designed to offer the ultimate track-ready version of the Corvette, featuring the potent LT1 engine, heavy-duty transmission, upgraded suspension and larger brakes.\n\nThe original ZR1 was produced in limited numbers, with only 53 built between 1970 and 1972. Despite its short production run, the ZR1 established the foundation for what would become a legendary performance badge.\n\nThe ZR1 was a niche offering until it truly came into its own with the C4 generation, which was introduced in 1989 for the 1990 model year. This iteration, often referred to as the \"King of the Hill,\" was a collaborative effort between GM and Lotus Engineering. The centerpiece of the C4 ZR-1 was the LT5 engine, a 5.7L V-8 designed by Lotus and built by Mercury Marine.\n\nThe LT5 was a technological marvel, featuring a double overhead camshaft design and 32 valves, producing an impressive 375 hp at its debut, later increased to 405 hp. Its performance caught the industry by surprise, with a top speed of over 180 mph (290 km/h) and a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of around 4.5 seconds. The C4 ZR-1 remained in production until 1995, earning a reputation as one of the most capable sports cars of its era.\n\nThe C6 ZR1: The Return of the King\n\nAfter a hiatus, the ZR1 nameplate made a return with the C6 generation in 2009. This new ZR1 was a game-changer, featuring the supercharged LS9 engine, a 6.2L V-8 producing an impressive 638 hp and 604 lb.-ft. (819 Nm) of torque. This made it the most powerful production Corvette at the time and one of the fastest cars in the world.\n\nThe C6 ZR1 incorporated advanced materials and technology to enhance its performance. The use of carbon fiber for the hood, roof, fenders and front splitter helped reduce weight, while the Magnetic Ride Control system provided exceptional handling. The C6 ZR1 could achieve a top speed of 205 mph (330 km/h) and accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 3.4 seconds, solidifying its status as a supercar.\n\nThe C7 ZR1, the outgoing model, was introduced in 2019, featuring the LT5 engine, a supercharged 6.2L V-8 producing 755 hp and 715 lb.-ft. (969 Nm) of torque, capable of reaching a top speed of 212 mph (341 km/h) and hitting 0-60 in under 3 seconds.", "source": {"uri": "wardsauto.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ward's Communications

That was an unthinkable number for a comfortable, production car but today it's being surpassed by a Corvette.\n\nWe're talking about the all-new ZR1, which defies expectations thanks to a twin-turbo 5.5-liter flat-plane crank V8 engine. It produces a staggering 1,064 hp (793 kW / 1,079 PS) and 828 lb-ft (1,121 Nm) of torque.\n\n2024 Corvette E-Ray Review: AWD And Hybrid Power Makes For A Better Vette\n\nThose are hypercar numbers and the ZR1 can laugh in the face of the Ferrari 296 GTB, 12Cilindri, and SF90 Stradale. It also packs a more powerful punch than the Lamborghini Revuelto, McLaren 750S, Pagani Huayra, and Mercedes-AMG One. That shouldn't be surprising as Chevrolet noted the car has the most powerful V8 engine ever produced in America by an automotive manufacturer.\n\nThe engine is known as the LT7 and it has a lot in common with the LT6 that resides in the Corvette Z06. However, it's been extensively upgraded to handle the new turbochargers and added performance.\n\nHighlights include a larger combustion chamber and new head castings with unique ports. The valve timing and lift profile has also been optimized for forced induction, while there's a new intake and \"intelligent anti-lag engine calibration techniques.\" The mill also sports unique pistons and connecting rods as well as a secondary fuel injection system.\n\nThe powertrain improvements extend beyond the engine compartment as the eight-speed dual-clutch transmission has been thoroughly revised. It features wider profile gears, stronger shafts, and improved lubrication. There are also improvements to \"handle the massive torque of the LT7.\"\n\nThanks to all these changes, Corvette executive chief engineer Tadge Juechter told us the ZR1 \"pulls like a freight train.\" While Chevrolet wasn't ready to give hard numbers, officials said the car should be able to hit a top speed \"comfortably\" above 215 mph (346 km/h). They went on to suggest the top speed could be significantly higher than that and confirmed the model won't be electronically limited.\n\nSticking with the performance theme, four test drivers hit 200 mph (322 km/h) on the N\u00fcrburgring during their first outing with the car. On the drag strip, the ZR1 should be able to run the quarter mile in less than 9.7 seconds at 150 mph (241 km/h). If that estimate pans out, the Corvette would be slower than the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 which accomplished the same task in 8.91 seconds at 151.17 mph (243 km/h).\n\nWhile the Demon is a quarter mile bruiser, the times are a little surprising considering the ZR1 is significantly lighter. In particular, the coupe weighs 3,670 lbs (1,665 kg) dry, while the convertible comes in at 3,758 lbs (1,705 kg).\n\nRegardless, when it comes time to stop, owners will be thankful for a unique carbon ceramic braking system that has discs measuring 15.7 inches (400 mm) front and 15.4 inches (390 mm) rear. They enable the ZR1 to go from 80-200-80 mph (129-322-129 km/h) in a mere 24.5 seconds, which is 22% quicker than the C7 Corvette ZR1 and 53% faster than the C6 Corvette ZR1.\n\nA Sporty, But Functional Design\n\nDespite having 404 hp (301 kW / 410 PS) more than a Ford GT, the Corvette ZR1 is surprisingly restrained. However, there are a handful of clues this isn't your run-of-the-mill model.\n\nOne of the most obvious is the flow-through hood. It sees air enter the front grille, flow through an intercooler, and exit the hood to aid cooling while also increasing front downforce.\n\nBuyers will also find a carbon fiber roof and a small spoiler with adjustable wickers. They're joined by 20- and 21-inch carbon fiber or aluminum wheels that are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. The model also has an assortment of other carbon fiber components including the front splitter, rocker moldings, side intakes, and front underwing. Other highlights include brake cooling ducts and 15 heat exchangers.\n\nThe ZR1 will be offered in coupe and convertible guise, but only the former will have a split rear window. It quietly returned on the Z06 GT3.R race car and now it's coming back to a road-going model for the first time in decades.\n\nHowever, this is no old school throwback as the window has two panels that are separated by a carbon fiber 'spine.' The latter incorporates functional vents to improve heat extraction from the engine compartment.\n\nThe optional ZTK performance package promises to turn the ZR1 into a \"true track weapon\" and it certainly looks the part thanks to a massive rear wing, front dive planes, and a hood-mounted Gurney lip. The changes continue underneath the car as the front underwing is replaced by underbody strakes to increase downforce. Besides the aerodynamic styling tweaks, the package includes stiffer springs, revised dampers, and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires.\n\nIf the latter items don't appeal to you, the Carbon Aero package might be right up your alley. It includes all the aerodynamic styling changes from the ZTK performance package, but nothing else. They enable the car to generate over 1,200 lbs (544 kg) of downforce at top speed.\n\nSpeaking of speed, that's what separates the standard model from the ZTK. As designers and engineers explained at a media briefing last month, the standard ZR1 is the \"top speed king\" thanks to its sleeker styling and reduced drag. The ZTK, on the other hand, is a \"track king\" that hugs the road.\n\nA Familiar Interior With A Handful Of Special Touches\n\nIf you've been in a C8 Corvette, the interior will feel instantly recognizable as not much has changed. However, buyers will find ZR1 badging on the steering wheel, sill plates, and interior plaque. Besides that, there's a boost gauge as well as unique door panel stitching on the 3LZ variant.\n\nWe can expect to learn full equipment details closer to launch, but the model should come equipped with a familiar 12-inch digital instrument cluster and an 8-inch infotainment system with Google built-in. They're joined by supportive seats and plenty of carbon fiber trim.\n\nArrives Next Year\n\nThe Corvette ZR1 will go into production next year and be built in Bowling Green, Kentucky. While that's a ways off, officials told us they had to introduce the model early in order to test prototypes without camouflage. The disguise impacts the car's performance, so it had to go to finish up testing.\n\nThere's no word on pricing, but the model will slot above the Z06 which begins at $110,100.", "source": {"uri": "carscoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carscoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gauthier@carscoops.com", "name": "Michael Gauthier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Revuelto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini Revuelto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_296", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari 296"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-AMG_ONE", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-AMG ONE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-plane_crank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flat-plane crank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_SF90_Stradale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari SF90 Stradale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagani_Huayra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pagani Huayra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecting_rod", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecting rod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel injection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppet_valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poppet valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_chamber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combustion chamber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00fcrburgring", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N\u00fcrburgring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling Green, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bowling Green, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Carscoops-Corvette-ZR1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The following month, Chevy revealed July 25 as the reveal date. However, the time and location hadn't been made public. Until today, that is. According to MidEngineCorvetteForum big kahuna John, the newcomer will debut at the Miami Track Concours Club at 7:00 PM Eastern Time. The MidEngineCorvetteForum admin didn't get an invitation.\n\nJohn further shared that \"not a single friend\" of his got invited, not even well-connected folks or long-time customers. Then again, even if the media has priority at said event, remember that many peeps are on waiting lists for the 2025 model year Corvette ZR1.\n\nThe Concours Club is best described as an automotive resort with a private circuit. A haven for driving enthusiasts, the club opened its doors in June 2021. The final 100 memberships were sold for big money, as in a one-time fee of $375K and $35K per annum.\n\nTwo years were required to complete the circuit, which offers a 2,100-foot straightaway and seven different configurations. Located next to the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport, said complex further boasts some of the most advanced track telemetry out there.\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet on YouTube Regarding the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, the Detroit-based automaker confirmed the model year in late June 2024. Back then, General Motors also made it clear that vehicle availability would be announced sometime after the July 25 reveal of the most extreme C8 yet.\n\nBuilding on the wide-bodied Z06, the ZR1 is a twin-turbocharged affair with around 800 ponies to its name. It's rumored that General Motors pushed the LT7 engine to 850 horses, but even 800 is enough for the 2025 model to dethrone the previous-generation ZR1 as the most powerful production Corvette ever.\n\nThere is, however, a bit of a mystery surrounding the 5.5-liter V8. Based on leaked screenshots, the LT7 features Active Fuel Management, which is GM vernacular for cylinder deactivation technology. AFM should not be confused with Dynamic Fuel Management, which enables the truck-specific 5.3L and 6.2L small-block V8 engines to shut off seven cylinders in light load conditions.\n\nThe LT6 of the Z06 does not feature Active Fuel Management. What's more, GM-developed engines with AFM technology feature cross-plane crankshafts rather than a flat-plane unit. Whatever may be in the offing, there's no denying the ZR1 sounds like a muffled Z06 because of its twin-snail setup.\n\nBigger on aero than the Z06, the ZR1 further differs from the free-breathing model by means of a different regular production order code for the Tremec-supplied transaxle. Instead of M1M, the ZR1 uses the M1K version. Only GM and Tremec know for certain how the M1K differs from the M1M. The small-block Stingray and E-Ray, meanwhile, use dual-clutch transaxles dubbed M1L and MLH.\n\nOn that note, look forward to a higher starting price than what Chevy used to charge for the 2019 model year. Offered for one year only, the C7-gen ZR1 used to retail at $118,900 for the coupe. By comparison, the C8-gen Z06 currently starts at $112,700 sans destination.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mircea_panait@autoevolution.com", "name": "Mircea Panait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Fuel_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Active Fuel Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Gemini_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_small-block_engine_(first-_and_second-generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet small-block engine (first- and second-generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coupe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crossplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaxle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transaxle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variable displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stingray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cylinder (engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankshaft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crankshaft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-clutch_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dual-clutch transmission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/the-2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-will-be-revealed-at-the-miami-track-concours-club-237444_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 144, "textEnd": 151, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

What is anticipated to be the fastest, most powerful, most extreme version of the C8 is set to be revealed in just a few moments. The embargo on the new Chevy Corvette ZR1 lifts at 7:30 p.m. ET (4:30 p.m. PT) and we'll have all the shiny pictures and dirty details, so be sure to return to The Drive at that time.\n\nFor now, though, let's recap. Judging from a teaser released last month, the ZR1 will feature a big rear wing, at least four exhaust tips, and, in Chevy's own words, \"unthinkable speed.\" Concrete powertrain details remain a mystery but judging from a sound clip, it feels safe to expect twin turbos very likely attached to a flat-plane V8, similar to the one that comes in the Z06. Whether or not it'll also use hybrid assistance like the E-Ray remains to be seen.\n\nLike it has been with Corvette's past, the ZR1 is set to be the world-beating peak of the Corvette lineup. Expect lots of weight-shedding carbon, lots of aero bits (possibly active), and lots of wild numbers. For reference, the previous-gen C7 ZR1 already made 755 horsepower and 715 lb-ft of torque from its supercharged 6.2-liter LT5 V8 so expect the C8 ZR1 to make, well, more than that.\n\nGet ready, folks.

It's everything we hoped for and more. It has 1,064 horsepower, for goodness' sake, and I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nRarely do we get so excited over a new car anymore. Five-hundred horsepower is so common we've become numb to it, as well as 600 and even 700 hp. But crank that up to four digits on internal combustion alone while incorporating crazy aero and selling it as a red-blooded American performance machine, and suddenly, the fire is stoked. This is the real deal.\n\nIt might be peak Corvette.\n\nThere's plenty of ink to spill on how sick this car is, but first, I'll give you the powertrain deets. The new ZR1 runs a 5.5-liter, flat-plane crank, twin-turbo V8 that makes all that horsepower at 7,000 rpm and 828 lb-ft of torque at 6,000 rpm. It's dubbed the LT7 and it joins the Z06's LT6 as one half of the Gemini Small Block twins. Y'know, like the spacecraft. There are a lot of shared components between the two engines, but this is more than an LT6 with boost.\n\nThe forced-induction power plant was always part of the plan. As such, GM designed the engine platform to support twin-turbocharging and the LT7 has a laundry list of specific parts. For starters, the combustion chambers are larger, and the head castings have unique ports because the exhaust needs to be channeled to the center and down into a turbine rather than out and up into tubular headers like on the Z06. Almost everything in the crank train is different, including the pistons, wrist pins, and forged titanium connecting rods that are shorter on the LT7 because they sit lower in the combustion chamber. There's even a secondary port fuel injection system because this sucker needs so much more gas than its naturally aspirated counterpart.\n\nThat's partially because the dual ball-bearing, mono scroll, 76-millimeter turbos are so powerful. GM says they consume an entire Olympic swimming pool's volume of air in just four minutes at full tilt. Their fans rotate at 1.7 times the speed of sound. They're just flat nasty.\n\nAll this contributes to a total power output greater than two 7.0-liter LS7s combined. It's wild to think that each four-cylinder power bank makes more than the C6 Corvette Z06's vaunted engine. It's the most powerful V8 ever produced in America by a car company.\n\nIt smokes the rear tires (and only the rear tires) after making its way through an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. I love a manual as much as the next guy, but there's no way you could shift fast enough to match this 'box. And if you're still worried about engagement when you have that engine and those turbos immediately behind your noggin, pausing for just millimeters as you pull the paddle behind the wheel, then you probably need to check in with reality.\n\nI want to point out a more subtle detail you might miss before moving on to the rest of the styling: The split rear window. Officially, this is the first production Corvette with such a feature since 1963, but it's been hiding in plain sight on the Corvette Z06 GT3.R race car all along. In turn, it's also functional, helping extract heat from the engine compartment -- which, by the way, Corvette Executive Chief Engineer Tadge Juechter tells me is a real necessity:\n\n\"When we go on our ride trips, you can see the heat sort of boiling out, and when somebody takes off hard, so much hot air comes out of the exhaust it's like the whole car disappears into a mirage. You can see all these heatwaves coming out.\"\n\nSick.\n\nAll the photos you're seeing of this yellow ZR1 show what Chevy calls the ZTK Performance Package. It's the mightiest spec by far, producing 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed. Thanks to that and the optimized weight distribution of the mid-engined layout, the rear tires stand a chance of keeping traction and the body, on the ground.\n\nThe rear wing is the most striking visual of all, but notice also the dive planes and the Gurney lip on the hood. These combine with underbody strakes to keep the front planted. I imagine it's mighty easy to make the back-end kick out, but just as important as that is getting the turning tires to stick to the track.\n\nIn addition to the aero upgrades, ZR1s with the ZTK kit get stiffer springs and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires rather than the standard model's Pilot Sport 4S rubber. Customers who prefer the wild look but a softer ride can get the Carbon Aero package, which offers all the same aero without the other track upgrades. ZTK obviously isn't available for the convertible, but that's the price you pay for having your cake and eating it too with open-air thrills.\n\nThe ZR1 will be sold in all the same colors as the Stingray, with Competition Yellow, Hysteria Purple, and Sebring Orange added to the mix. That last one was the hero color on the C7 ZR1 and I can't wait to see a C8 done up that way.\n\nEven with everything that's visually striking on the C8 ZR1, there's a lot going on that you can't see on the surface or when the hood is popped. Most relevant to performance would be the carbon ceramic brake rotors, which measure 15.7 inches up front and 15.4 inches out back.\n\nThere have never been larger brakes mounted to the front of the Corvette, and they help the ZR1 go from 80 to 200 mph and back to 80 mph in only 24.5 seconds. Kind of a specific stat, I know, but it's apparently one Chevy has been measuring for a while as it says that's 22% quicker than the C7 ZR1 and 53% quicker than the C6 ZR1. Wow.\n\nVisible ducts behind the doors funnel cool air to the brakes, which is hugely important when you're carrying crazy speed into sharp corners. The Corvette team highlights that they're using a different manufacturing technology that yields greater braking strength and also reduces temps. It's a multi-level approach, see.\n\nI've been spewing stats this whole time, but they're just fragments of the bigger picture. To get a better idea of what this performance translates to, Chevy says the car's first lap around GM's Milford Proving Grounds track was quicker than the C7 ZR1 ever managed. Also, it runs the quarter-mile in less than 10 seconds. Also, it hits 200 mph in more than one spot around the Nurburgring. Also... you get the idea.\n\nChevy won't say yet just how fast the ZR1 is around the Nurburgring, but I get the sense they're gunning for a record. I can't imagine they're far off, either.\n\nIf you want to buy one of these machines yourself and you have the means to do so, get your checkbooks ready. Chevy hasn't said how much the ZR1 will cost, but since the Z06 starts around $115,000, I imagine this will come close to hitting or exceeding the $200,000 mark.

And this year, Chevy has introduced the latest in the line, the 2025 Corvette ZR1. It's the most powerful one ever, with features never before seen on the model. You can read all about it in our main feature story, but the ZR1's history is worth its own look. That's what you'll find here, with an overview of all five ZR1 generations, plus some interesting facts related to them.\n\nZR1s past and present First-gen 1970-1972 C3 ZR-1:\n\nA \"Special Purpose Engine Package\" intended for racing, not a standalone model. Upgraded mechanicals like brakes and suspension; omitted power steering, air conditioning, radio, and wheel covers. Engine: Reworked LT1 350-cubic-inch V8 with a four-barrel carburetor. Put out 370 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 380 pound-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm. Not the most powerful trim in the lineup; a 454-c.i. LS5 option got 390 hp. Specs: 0-60 miles per hour in 5.7 seconds, quarter-mile in 14.2 seconds at 102 mph, 3,285 pounds. Price: $968.95 on top of the $5,192 base Corvette coupe price. Production: 53, coupe and convertible, four-speed manual only. Note: The only ZR-1 so far to come near the beginning of a generation; the C3 launched in 1968. A Car and Driver review at the time said, \"The present Corvette will doubtlessly be the last front-engine model,\" predicting a mid-engined coupe by 1972 (the C3 retired in 1982). Chevrolet's then-GM John DeLorean \"pronounced the mid-engine version must be a functional sports/GT car, weighing in the neighborhood of 2600 lbs. and containing an engine of about 400 cu. in.\" Second-gen 1990-1995 C4 ZR-1:\n\nThe RPO ZR1 option effectively created a different car. Engine: New all-aluminum 5.7-liter, 32-valve, quad-cam LT5 V8 designed by Lotus in England, built by Mercury Marine in Oklahoma. 375 hp and 380 lb-ft. That was 125 hp and 40 lb-ft over the standard Corvette. The air management system could deactivate eight of the sixteen intake runners and fuel injectors to satisfy fuel economy requirements. Tires: Goodyear Eagle GS-C 275/40 ZR 17 in front, 315/35 ZR 17 in back. The just-launched Lamborghini Diablo wore 245/40 ZR 17 tires in front, 335/35 ZR 17 in back. Specs: 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds, 13.13 quarter mile at 110 mph, 180-mph top speed, skidpad 0.93 G, 3,465 pounds. Price: $58,995 -- the $27,016 option price on top of the $31,979 base coupe MSRP. In 1991 the ZR-1 option price jumped to $31,000, making the ZR-1 the first GM product to cost more than $60,000. Production: 6,939, all six-speed manual coupes. Note: The C4 ZR-1 broke records, birthed a legend, and by the end of its run the 405-hp LT5 V8 was the first mass-produced V8 engine rated over 400 hp in the post-smog era. Third-gen 2009-2013 C6 ZR1 ('now hyphenless, kids!'):\n\nA dedicated model, the fastest, most powerful, most expensive model GM had ever built. Engine: Highly modified LS3 called the LS9 -- a supercharged, 6.2-liter, pushrod V8 with 638 horsepower and 604 pound-feet of torque, 208 horsepower more than the base Corvette, 133 horsepower more than the Z06. Specs: 0-60 mph in 3.4 seconds, quarter mile in 11.5 seconds at 128.3 mph, 205-mph top speed, skidpad 1.05g, 3,350 pounds. Price: $105,000, compared to $47,895 for a base coupe and $30,055 add-on for the Z06. Production: 4,684. Coupe, six-speed manual only. Note: Was the literal answer to the real-life question, \"Geez, if that's what you can do with $60,000 [for the Z06], I wonder what a $100,000 Corvette would look like?\" Fourth-gen 2019 C7 ZR1:\n\nA one-year-only send-off for the front-engine Corvette. Engine: Upgraded version of the Z06's supercharged LT5 6.2-liter pushrod V8. It featured a larger supercharger and intercooler, additional radiators and an output of 755 horsepower and 715 pound-feet of torque. That was an increase of 105 horsepower and 65 pound-feet of torque over the Z06. Specs: 0-60 mph in 2.8 seconds, quarter-mile in 10.6 seconds at 134 mph, 212-mph top speed, 3,560 pounds (coupe). Price: $120,990 Note: This generation of the ZR1 was available with either an automatic or manual transmission, as well as both targa and convertible body styles. This was the first time since the original ZR-1 that the two body styles were on offer. Another neat fact: Chevy put a hole in the already larger hood to accommodate the bigger supercharger and intercooler. Fifth-gen 2025 C8 ZR1:\n\nThe first mid-engine ZR1, the first turbocharged turbocharged ZR1, the first with a flat-plane crankshaft, and the first to crest 1,000 horsepower. Engine: Twin-turbo 5.5-liter LT7 V8. It's derived from the DOHC, flat-plane crank-equipped V8 from the C8.R racecar and Z06 street car, but with a pair of turbochargers. It makes 1,064 horsepower and 828 pound-feet of torque -- an insane 394 horsepower more than the Z06. Specs: Specific acceleration times haven't been announced, but Chevy estimates under 10 seconds for the quarter-mile and a top speed above 215 mph. Price: TBD Note: This is the last Corvette that will have been worked on by legendary Corvette engineer Tadge Juechter.\n\nZR1 spotter's guide: From wallflower to war hammer\n\nThe C3 ZR-1 hid its fancy bits inside, and was indistinguishable from the regular Stingray. The C4 ZR-1 had a wider rear with a convex fascia and rounded-square taillights, rectangular exhaust tips, and a CHMSL at the top of the rear hatch. C6 ZR1 flourishes like the hood's polycarbonate window, twin gills on the front fenders, carbon brakes and CF roof make it unmistakable. The C7 ZR1 can only be confused with the kind of mortal threat usually plastered with \"BEWARE OF\" signs. The C8 takes after the ZR1 with massive vents and other aero aids. It even revives the split-window look from the C2 with heat extractors down the middle of the rear window.\n\nA suspension's bumpy road\n\nIn 1988 GM engineers worked with Lotus and Bilstein on an Active Handling system for the C4 ZR1 that would measure \"speed, tire load, steering, throttle, and several other inputs into a complex algorithm\" to adjust twin hydraulic dampers on the fly. Bilstein had helped develop the active suspension on the Porsche 959, and Lotus' Formula 1 team had been working on Active Suspension since 1981.\n\nGM built 25 prototypes in 1989 to test the system, but Active Handling wouldn't jibe with 1980s technology and production-car requirements. Problems included electrical interference, insufficient responsiveness, the system's 300-pound weight, and a 5-hp draw to run the 2,200-psi, belt-driven hydraulic pump. Furthermore, boutique bits like Moog actuators jacked up the price; at one point GM planned on making Active Handling a $39,000 option on top of the C4 ZR-1's price.\n\nGM walked away from that to develop the Selective Ride FX3 suspension, still a notable advance. However, engineers applied the C4 ZR-1 lessons and new technology to the Active Handling on the C5 Corvette, and the now-familiar magnetorheological suspension that's still good enough for the C7 and C8 ZR1s.\n\nFrom Blues Brothers to space\n\nThe C6 ZR1 engine bay featured an embossed Jake on the intake snorkel, as a nod to the Corvette Racing Team. Some trivia: One of Jake's origin stories says he's named after the \"Blues Brothers\" character. The stylized blue version of Jake seen on C6 ZR1 mules and prototypes was \"Blue Devil\" Elwood, \"Blue Devil\" being the development code name for the C6 ZR1.\n\nThe C8 ZR1 hides an engine bay secret, too. There's a little rocket on the engine (and on the Z06's) since the twin-cam engine family is named Gemini, like the NASA space program of the same name. The mythological roots of Gemini refer to twins, and we wonder if part of the name selection had to do with the engine architecture being double-overhead cam, also referred to as \"twin cam.\"\n\nKeep it down back there\n\nChevrolet says the manually adjustable High Wing in the ZTK Performance Package for the C7 ZR1 produces up to 950 pounds of rear downforce at speed. The new C8 ZR1 ZTK Package produces a combined 1,200 pounds. The Big Wing on the 2016 Dodge Viper ACR collected 1,500 pounds of downforce at 150 mph. The Bugatti Chiron rear wing produces 772 pounds of rear downforce at 236 mph; in full 49-degree airbrake mode the Chiron wing presses nearly 2,000 pounds on the rear axle.\n\nKilling Vipers\n\nThe C4 ZR-1 needed major surgery to beat the original Viper (admittedly, the original Viper was little more than two seats and four wheels bolted to an explosion). Chevrolet engineer and race driver John Heinricy created the so-called \"Snake Skinner\" ZR-1 by practically gutting a C4 ZR-1 interior, tweaking the engine, and swapping stock parts throughout for lighter parts.\n\nThe C6 ZR1 needed no operations, winning every comparo that didn't involve a Viper ACR, and that judged anything other than raw personality.\n\nAnd in the end, the 'Vette won the war, as the Viper's gone, but the Viper leaves one last legacy. The Viper ACR's 7:01.30 N\u00fcrburgring time still stands as the fastest lap by an American production car. The C7 ZR1 never got its shot at setting a record, so the task will fall to the new C8 version.\n\nMore Information Compare the Corvette with similar vehicles Chevrolet Corvette Mercedes-Benz AMG SL

We're getting 1,064 hp instead. That makes the ZR1 not only the most powerful Corvette of all time, but also the most powerful gas-powered American production car of all time, Chevy boasted on Thursday. If the 375-hp 1990 Corvette ZR1 was the King of the Hill, this one is the King of Mount Everest.\n\nThe power comes courtesy of the new LT7 twin-turbocharged dual-overhead-cam 5.5-liter V-8. It's a version of the Z06's LT6 670-hp V-8. Chevy engineers knew the LT6 and LT7 would be related from the start, so they called the duo Small Block Gemini. The pair share a flat-plane-crank design, as well as the same block, valvetrain, direct-injection system, and lubrication system. The LT7, however, gets a pair of 76-mm turbochargers that blow up to 20 psi of boost on the engine to increase total output to 1,064 hp at 7,000 rpm and 828 lb-ft of torque at 6,000 rpm, with at least 800 lb-ft at the ready from 3,000-6,500 rpm.\n\nAdding the turbos also required changes. The block gets additional machining, the head's intake and exhaust ports are revised, the combustion chambers are larger, the cam profiles change, port injection is added, the crank train is beefed up with bigger rods and pistons, and a seventh dry sump stage is added. The compression ratio also falls from 12.5:1 down to 9.8:1 and the redline drops from 8,600 to a still high 8,000 rpm. Chevy says an electronically actuated wastegate reduces turbo lag, especially once the vehicle is under way. With 5.5 liters of displacement, it doesn't need that much help from a start, though. In fact, engineers had to limit torque on the 1-2 shift because the available power can be too excessive.\n\nThe turbos hang off the sides of the engine, and Chevy said they wouldn't have fit under the hood of a front-engine car (that's why the last ZR1's V-8 extended upward with a supercharger instead of outward with turbos). A total of 15 heat exchangers keep the powertrain from getting too hot, and that includes a new intercooler mounted up front and a pair of much larger charge air coolers located between the turbos and intake manifold. That manifold sports a blue texture that Chevy associates with the ZR1.\n\nChevy isn't giving many performance figures yet, noting that some of that stuff needs to be done with cars that aren't covered in camouflage. However, engineers expect a quarter-mile time of 9.7 seconds at 150 mph and a top speed in excess of 215 mph. Chevy also says the car can go from 80 to 200 to 80 mph in 24.5 seconds, 22% quicker than the C7 ZR1.\n\nSoon-to-retire Corvette Chief Engineer Tadge Juechter told Motor Authority that the ZR1 has put up seven-minute times at the N\u00fcrburgring with him at the wheel in traffic and using a standing start, implying faster times are likely. Whether Chevy can put up an official 'Ring time will depend on if the Corvette team can get the track time and good weather conditions, among other hurdles. Chevy also noted that four ZR1s have exceeded 200 mph on the 'Ring's longest straight.\n\nExpect top speed, 0-60 mph, and times at other tracks (Virginia International Raceway likely among them) to be announced closer to the car's on-sale date. Same goes for pricing, though that should start in the upper $100,000s and top $200,000 with the available ZTK Performance Package. More on that in a bit.\n\nThe 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission remains the only choice, but it had to be revised to handle the ZR1's grunt. It has wider gear profiles, stronger shafts, and improved lubrication.\n\nStronger brakes are also needed to arrest the ZR1's higher speeds. They use carbon-ceramic rotors and the fronts grow to 15.7 inches in diameter from 15.4 inches while retaining 6-piston calipers. They are also slightly wider in cross section and they get a semi-polished appearance instead of the Z06's raw carbon look. The rears are 15.4 inches across with 4-piston calipers.\n\nMore speed and more power required more downforce and more cooling ducts for both the coupe and convertible body styles. Up front, the base ZR1 increases downforce with a carbon-fiber splitter, an underwing with stall Gurney deflectors, and a flow-through hood. The side intakes add brake ducts at their trailing edges, and the coupe gets new intakes on top of the rear fenders to supply more air to the engine. The coupe also gets a functional take on the 1963 Corvette's rear split-window design, with louvers along its center spine and outboard edges for more airflow. It will be offered in body color or exposed-weave carbon fiber. Both body styles also gain carbon-fiber roofs. Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires wrap around 20-inch front and 21-inch rear alloy wheels, which can be had in Edge Blue. A new 10-spoke carbon-fiber wheel is optional.\n\nThe ZTK Performance Package takes things up a few notches. It adds a big carbon-fiber rear wing, front dive planes, and a tall hood Gurney lip. Underneath, strakes replace the Gurney deflectors. The package gives the ZR1 more than 1,200 pounds of downforce at its so-far unrevealed top speed. It also rides on Michelin Pilot Cup 2R tires, which are just shy of slicks and will provide lots of grip. Chevy said the wing will be available separately, and the whole ZTK aero treatment can be ordered as the Carbon Aero package for the base ZR1.\n\nAll told, the ZR1 additions will increase the weight about 200 pounds over the Z06 with a dry weight of 3,670 pounds for the coupe and 3,758 pounds for the convertible. Chevy says the suspension tuning will be slightly softer than the very track-focused Z06. The ZTK package will be stiffer, but not as stiff as the Z06 with its Z07 Performance Package.\n\nInterior changes amount to only ZR1 badges and a slightly different door upholstery pattern.\n\nThe 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 is due to hit dealers next year.", "source": {"uri": "motorauthority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor Authority"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kirk_bell@motorauthority.com", "name": "Kirk Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Gemini_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Downforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_injection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manifold injection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_sump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dry sump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valvetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel injection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlet_manifold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inlet manifold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_(mechanism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crank (mechanism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_chamber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combustion chamber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compression ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercooler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intercooler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00fcrburgring", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N\u00fcrburgring"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/chevrolet-corvette_100937449_h.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

In 2024, GM Performance is back with another first: a turbocharged Corvette ZR1 with more than 1,000 horsepower. If you thought the Z06 was the ultimate performance Corvette, well, think again. This ain't your grandaddy's ZR1.\n\nLet's dispense with the powertrain first. The 2025 ZR1 will be powered by GM's new twin-turbo LT7 V8. This 5.5L engine shares its fundamental architecture with the Z06's LT6. In this case, that means more than just a common displacement. The LT7 also inherits the LT6's flat-plane crank -- something Ford's 5.2-liter \"Voodoo\" V8 lost in the transition from the naturally aspirated GT350 to the supercharged GT500. Not so here. The single-scroll 76 mm turbochargers feed enough air to the LT7 to produce 1,064 horsepower and 828 pound-feet of torque.\n\nFrom there, power goes through the eight-speed dual clutch transmission, which gets beefier input shafts (inner and outer), stronger shot-peened gears, and improved oil management for high-G loads. All in, GM says this combo is good for a top speed of more than 215 mph and a quarter-mile run in under 10 seconds. There's no official 0-to-60 time yet, but you can certainly expect it to be blisteringly quick, especially for a rear-wheel drive machine.\n\nWhat changed between the LT6 and LT7? Secondary port fuel injection New head castings with redesigned ports and a larger combustion chamber New valve train timing and lift profile optimized for boost New piston/connecting rod design Completely new intake system Dual, ported shroud, ball bearing, mono-scroll (76 mm) turbochargers \"Intelligent\" anti-lag engine calibration\n\nNothing goes hand-in-hand with high-performance Corvettes like aggressive air management. In this case, we're referring to both cooling and aerodynamic upgrades. The new \"flow-through\" hood design ingests air through the grille, where it passes through the intercooler and exits through the hood. This improves both front downforce and charged air temperatures, GM says. The ZR1 offers a slicker exterior and a small spoiler with adjustable wickers.\n\nThe front splitter, underwing (with gurney deflectors) and rocker moldings are part of the standard aero package. ZTK adds the crazy rear wing, front dive planes and the hood gurney lip. Underneath, strakes replace the underwing stall gurney to improve downforce in the nose. The ZR1's side blades each incorporate two air inlets (four total). One in each feeds a bank of the LT7 V8, while the other connects to a brake duct. There's also a new extraction vent on each side of the ZR1's rear deck to pull heat out of the engine compartment.\n\nGM's Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 is responsible for managing the ZR1's chassis, which is matched up with 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels wrapped in Michelin performance tires (275/30ZR20 front; 345/25ZR21 rear). The standard package utilizes the Pilot Sport 4S, while ZTK models will ship with Pilot Sport Cup 2-Rs. The ZTK package also includes stiffer springs, but otherwise preserves the MRC 4.0 setup of the base ZR1. Dry weight checks in at 3,670 pounds for the coupe and 3,758 pounds for the convertible; all that carbon fiber pays dividends.\n\nThis is the last Corvette designed under the direction of legendary Corvette engineer Tadge Juechter, and from what we've seen so far, it's a sendoff he can be proud of. The 2025 ZR1 will hit showrooms next year.\n\nMore Information Compare the Corvette with similar vehicles Chevrolet Corvette Mercedes-Benz AMG SL 43 Lexus LC 500h Side-By-Side All Model Years For Sale Rebates & Incentives News & Reviews Photos & Videos More Corvette Information Featured Gallery Motorsports Chevrolet Convertible Coupe Performance", "source": {"uri": "autoblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Autoblog"}, "authors": [{"uri": "byron_hurd@autoblog.com", "name": "Byron Hurd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oldsmobile Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Gemini_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-plane_crank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flat-plane crank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Modular_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Modular engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_GT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super GT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Mustang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shelby Mustang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engine displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecting_rod", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecting rod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://edgecast-img.yahoo.net/mysterio/api/BD6ADC52B7EA310F769F1BC16029B13F3CA75A8A6A091021AF79576B86B70E1E/autoblog/resizefill_w1200_h675;quality_85;format_webp;cc_31536000;/https://s.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1200x675/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2024/07/25103857/zr1-lede.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

There's a lot more to it than the big numbers, though. Luckily, we got a chance to talk to several of the lead engineers behind the car, including its executive chief engineer, Tadge Juechter.\n\nThe C8 ZR1 is the last Corvette to be unveiled under Juechter's watch, and as such, it's a special beast. As he explains, it's been tough keeping it all under wraps.\n\n\"When the Z06 came out, people were calling this the wishbone,\" Juechter said, referring to the trim around the Z06's side-mounted radiator inlets. On the C8 ZR1, the \"wishbone\" was hollowed, its shape modified to feed cool air to the rear brakes, one of several key components from less-powerful Corvettes that were tweaked to accommodate GM's twin-turbocharged monster.\n\nThe Z06's LT6 engine and the ZR1's LT7 are likewise closely related. Some parts on the LT6 were clearly designed to accommodate the ZR1's turbocharging system. The dry sump oil tank, for instance, is common between the two engines; However, it's sculpted to avoid turbocharger plumbing. \"If you look at an LT6, there's a weird area that isn't used. And why would we sculpt the tank like that?\" Dustin Gardner, assistant chief engineer of the Small Block engine, told us.\n\nSince the Z06 debuted first, this detail and others have been hiding in plain sight the entire time. Similar harder-to-spot details include portions of the engine block itself -- an identical casting between the two engines -- which are machined differently between the two cars.\n\nWhat's equally interesting is how much has stayed the same. Every C8 gets the same basic chassis, for instance, just with different unsprung suspension components attached. As a result, every engine must fit in the same space behind the passengers, which was one of the reasons the car went mid-engine.\n\nThere's a lot more space in the back for a variety of drivetrains than under the hood, which is what enabled the twin-turbo setup.\n\n\"Even though the tires [in the back] are wide, they're set wide,\" Juechter explained. \"So between the inside face of the sidewalls, you still have about [this] much room,\" he said, referring to an LT7 engine next to him.\n\nThat said, the turbocharger's hot sides are still cast as a part of the exhaust manifolds, and everything is tucked right up against the block to get the engine as narrow as possible. If the Corvette was still front-engined, going to turbos would've likely meant a hot-vee configuration, which comes with its own challenges.\n\n\"The only motivation to do a hot-vee is... because the engine is in the front.

The last-generation ZR1 had a mere 755 horsepower -- over 300 less than the C8 version. For that reason, developing this car presented some interesting challenges. How would the Corvette team develop the new ZR1's tires, suspension, and powertrain without having any data on something that powerful? The solution was interesting, to say the least.\n\nIn a walkaround of a new ZR1 during the car's reveal, the Executive Chief Engineer of the Corvette, Tadge Juechter, revealed how the company solved that problem.\n\n\"We had to cobble up a super high-horsepower, high-torque car,\" Juechter said. \"We built a mule. A hot-rodded [C8] Stingray, actually, with an LT5 in it. A hot-rodded LT5 with 850 horsepower and a sequential shift gearbox, to do tire development.\"\n\nWhile it sounds straightforward conceptually, Juechter had to sell upper management on the idea. \"It didn't take long for us to convince ourselves. Convincing leadership we need to go build this hot rod... oh we've gotta do this,\" he said, recollecting the chat with company brass.\n\nThe car did get built, of course, but it wasn't exactly a sweetheart to run. \"We put a smaller pulley on the supercharger and it used to just eat belts,\" Chief Engineer Josh Holder said, laughing. It was all necessary to get anywhere close to the ZR1's performance envelope, though. \"In hindsight, it was too slow,\" Chris Barber, the lead development engineer on the ZR1 noted. Despite this mule's performance, it was still 214 hp shy of the production car.\n\n\"It seemed epic at the time,\" recalled Juechter. But there was so much more to come.\n\nIt's unclear what happened to this mule after the ZR1's production-spec LT7 engine entered the picture, but judging by its track record for reliability, it was probably disposed of as quickly as possible.\n\nStill, though, for a little while, this mishmash of odds and ends was the most powerful Corvette ever built by GM.

They're most notably known for their six- and eight-cylinder engines, dating all the way back to 1918 for some of its straight-eight engines. At one point, during the mid 20th century, each General Motors brand had its own fleet of bespoke 8-cylinder engines to match its vehicle's aesthetic.\n\nChevrolet\n\nChevrolet, or Chevy as it's often called, is a household name and a major division of General Motors. Founded in 1911, Chevy established itself as an affordable carmaker, offering reliable vehicles for everyday drivers.\n\nParent Corporation General Motors\n\nFounded 1911\n\nFounder Louis Chevrolet and William C.

The most popular V8 of them all was the 454 V8, which was first found in muscle cars like the Chevrolet Chevelle. Then there are those V8 engines that were one-off or specialty editions. The ones that seemed like a good idea at the time, but didn't quite make it past a few hundred units. In some cases, maybe even just a couple of units.\n\nWith this article, HotCars is going to be covering the Chevrolet engines that never made it past 5,000 units of production. Some of these engines are so rare, in fact, that you can find their counterpart vehicles on sale for upwards of six figures. We're going to list them from most to least units made and then discuss what made each individual engine so special.\n\nHow we made our model selections: Entries are ranked from the highest number of units made to the least number of units made.

More capable than a standard C8 Corvette, the ZR1 model is expected to continue the model's legacy as the pinnacle of American sports car engineering. Interestingly, a certain Corvette ZR1 model can lay claim to being the rarest Vette in the 1970s. After all, Chevrolet build only one unit of the 1971 Corvette C3 ZR1 Convertible. The Corvette C3 ZR1s from 1970 to 1972 were already rare items, as Chevrolet only built a total of 53 units during these years. In 1971, Chevrolet built a total of 14,680 Corvette coupes and 7,121 convertibles. Of these numbers, only seven of the coupes and one of the convertibles were designated as ZR1. The Corvette C3 ZR2 was also rare, since Chevy assembled 10 coupe examples and only two convertibles. But since one is lesser than two, the 1971 Corvette C3 ZR1 convertible wins the distinction as the rarest of its kind in the 1970s.

The LS5 was one of two variations considered to be the lesser of two evils. What it lacks in horsepower, it makes up for in brute torque force. This 7.4-liter V8 outputs 360 horsepower and 500 pound-feet of total torque. It featured a four-barrel carburetor that helped elicit its torquey characteristics.\n\nWith a 4-speed manual transmission, the Chevelle could rocket up to 60 mph in just 6.5 seconds, which was a huge feat back then. This engine was also featured in the Monte Carlos and Corvettes of the day and only around 4,500 units were made with this LS5 option. It's so rare, in fact, that a Chevelle with this motor sold on Bring a Trailer for $101,000.\n\n9 LS6 454: 4,475 Units\n\nSpecifications\n\nEngine\n\n7.4-liter V8\n\nHorsepower\n\n438 hp\n\nTorque\n\n500 lb-ft\n\nNotable Applications\n\nChevelle SS, Corvette\n\nUnits Produced\n\n4,475\n\n(Source: Hemmings)\n\nTo date, the LS6 is the highest-output engine that Chevrolet has ever produced. It was 7.4 liters of pure insanity in eight total cylinders. It outputted a maximum horsepower of 438 ponies and 500 pound-feet of torque and was featured in icons like the Chevelle SS and Corvette.\n\nThis big cast iron block V8 could get a Chevelle up to 60 mph in just 5.4 seconds, which was unheard of at the time. Among other features, what made the LS6 so powerful was its oversized intake and exhaust system, as well as 454 cubic inches of total displacement.\n\nRelated\n\n12 Fastest Chevrolet Muscle Cars Over The Quarter-Mile In The '60s\n\nThe 1960s are the golden years of muscle cars, with all the American brands getting in on the action.

These engines are so rare that they were produced not at a Chevrolet plant, but instead at a marine engine facility where they had full knowledge of how to produce all-aluminum engines.\n\nInitially, the ZR-1 had decent success with 3,000 total units sold. Then it dropped into the hundreds after the first couple of years in production. They're not very highly valued either, with Hagerty giving a 'good condition' C4 ZR1 a value of only $22,000.\n\nAdd HotCars to your Google News feed.\n\nFollow On\n\nGoogle News\n\n7 Camaro Z/28 Cross-Ram: 602 Units\n\nSpecifications\n\nEngine\n\n4.9-liter V8\n\nHorsepower\n\n290 hp\n\nTorque\n\n290 lb-ft\n\nNotable Applications\n\nChevrolet Camaro Z/28\n\nUnits Produced\n\n602\n\n(Source: Hemmings)\n\nOne of the most unique motors on our list is the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z28's Cross-Ram engine. It was considered a small block with only 4.9 liters of displacement in a V8 configuration. It outputted one-to-one power with 290 horses and pound-feet of torque. What made this engine specifically unique was its massive, dual-intake manifold system that crossed over the engine block.\n\nIts aim was to increase overall performance with higher redlines. Unfortunately, the unique design caused issues such as complex maintenance, unruly heating issues, and a total lack of fuel efficiency. While 290 horsepower and pound-feet torque was decent for an engine of this size, it just wasn't manageable from a daily perspective.\n\nRelated\n\n12 Rarest Muscle Cars Ever Sold To The Public\n\nFrom race-spec V8-equipped Camaros to the only surviving Shelby helmed as the most dangerous car, here are the rarest production muscle cars.\n\n6 COPO 427: 373 Units\n\nSpecifications\n\nEngine\n\n7.0-liter V8\n\nHorsepower\n\n425 hp\n\nTorque\n\n460 lb-ft\n\nNotable Applications\n\nChevelle COPO, Nova COPO, Impala\n\nUnits Produced\n\n373\n\n(Source: Hemmings)\n\nNext to the LS5 and LS6, the big-block 7.0-liter COPO 427 engine is one of the rarest engines on the market.

But when the Chevrolet engineer said \"1,064 horsepower,\" the words \"holy shit\" escaped my mouth. I really try not to give that kind of feedback, but the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 warrants it.\n\nA four-figure horsepower number isn't the exclusive province of sketchy tuner cars anymore; there are a handful of warrantied engines and electric motor arrays making over a thousand horsepower, but mostly they do it in cars that weigh as much as a full-size pickup or more. The new ZR1 weighs 3670 pounds in coupe form and 3758 pounds in convertible form, which is within around 100 pounds of a Porsche 911 Turbo S. This mega-powerful powerplant is going to live in a relatively lightweight car, built by some of the best chassis engineers on the planet.\n\nThe ZR1's power figure is the headline, but things get wilder as you dig through the rest of the specs. The twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter LT7 V8 engine will also deliver 828 pound-feet of torque, and it's mated to a strengthened 8-speed dual-clutch automatic sending power to the rear wheels. That means it has 394 hp and 368 lb-ft more than the naturally aspirated Z06, and 409 hp and 233 lb-ft more than the E-Ray hybrid. It should run the quarter-mile in under 10 seconds on its way to a 215-mph top speed. Downforce at that top speed is at 1200 pounds.\n\nBuyers who opt for the track-intended ZTK package will get the big woven carbon-fiber wing you see on the yellow car above, plus carbon dive planes, Gurney lip and underbody strakes. Magnetic Ride springs are stiffer with the ZTK package, and instead of the standard Pilot Sport 4S tires you get Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R rubber, pictured below with a watch for scale because they're quite huge, measuring 275/30ZR20 up front and 345/25ZR21 at the rear. You can get the aero pieces on the standard ZR1, but don't.\n\nThe carbon-ceramic brakes have 15.7-inch rotors with six-piston calipers at the front and 15.4-inch discs with four-piston calipers at the rear. Chevy says the ZR1 will go from 80 mph to 200 mph and back to 80 in 24.5 seconds, 22 percent quicker than the C7 ZR1. Wheels are available in aluminum, which can be painted in Edge Blue to match the engine cover, or carbon fiber, which is to match all the carbon fiber. To keep things cool, there are massive carbon intakes on the hood and rear fenders, and on the coupe on the the rear hatch. The coupe also gets a cool split-window engine cover, a design feature last seen on the C2.\n\nAs Tadge Juechter said while I walked around the ZR1 cutaway, we're getting a look now because to do further testing, the camo had to come off. Expect to hear more unfathomable numbers from the ZR1 camp in the coming months, as the C8 ZR1 approaches its on-sale date sometime in 2025. Before you ask, no, we don't know how much it'll cost yet.\n\nFor now, here are my photos.

The updated 'Vette is more expensive, but there are option features that have just become more affordable. Customers can choose one of the three variants available: the C8 Stingray, E-Ray, and Z06, either as a Coupe or a Convertible. The only one that did not move an inch (or a dollar) in terms of pricing is the entry-level Stingray. The Stingray 1LT Coupe continues to start at $69,995.\n\nMeanwhile, GM prepared an approximately $2,000 price hike for the other two. The E-Ray 1LZ Coupe starts at $108,595 from the previous $104,900 for the 2024 model year, while the range-topping Z06 is a $113,900 affair instead of $110,900 from last year. Pricing includes the destination freight charge of $1,695, which remains unchanged for the 2025 model year.\n\nThe 2025 C8 Chevrolet Corvette is powered by the same 6.2-liter V8 LT2 engine, rated at 495 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque when it comes to the Stingray. A Tremec M1L eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission helps the V8 put the power down through the rear wheels.\n\nThe E-Ray goes one step further with 655 horsepower, coming from the same 6.2-liter V8 in an all-wheel drive setup. The Z06 is set in motion by the 5.5-liter V8 LT6, which pumps out 670 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque.\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet Sitting on GM's Y2 architecture, the Chevy Corvette rolls off the production line of the Bowling Green Assembly plant in Kentucky.

For instance, the RYQ Visible Carbon Fiber door Intake Trim and the SXR Suede Front Truck Liner can be purchased with the highest price hike of the list: $600 and $655, respectively, sending them to $3,955 and $1,750.\n\nGMAuthority also noticed some discounts on the options list. For instance, the 20-spoke Tech Bronz Wheels are now $300 cheaper at $3,195, while customers can check the optional 15-spoke Bright Polished Wheels for the Stingray version at $3,495, which is $855 less than before.\n\nChevrolet is working on a new version, the ZR1, which will be positioned above the Z06 in terms of power, performance, and pricing. The automaker started teasing the ZR1 back in April and will unveil it on July 25, which is today, at the Miami Track Concours Club.\n\nMany customers are reportedly already on the waiting list, even though pricing has yet to be announced.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elena_luchian@autoevolution.com", "name": "Elena Luchian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stingray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Convertible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Gemini_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Gemini small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_LS-based_small-block_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors LS-based small-block engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C7)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C7)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TREMEC_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TREMEC Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-clutch_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dual-clutch transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling Green, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bowling Green, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheels_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheels (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/2025-c8-chevy-corvette-gets-new-pricing-many-option-features-are-cheaper-237527_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764730", "eventUri": "eng-9764730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2662, "textEnd": 2669}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It's been America's flagship sports car since it first launched way back in 1953, and over those last seven decades a huge array of different models, trims and special editions have graced Chevy dealerships.\n\nWhile some of those Corvettes have been produced in huge numbers, such is the success of the model as a whole, many have only been sold in very limited numbers, usually in celebration of something. Honing in on the 1990s specifically, Chevrolet had plenty to celebrate, such as the 40th Anniversary of the Corvette, and motorsport appearances, such as with the 1995 Indy 500 Pace Car. However, scarce as those models are, it's another iconic trim that takes the title of Chevrolet's rarest production Corvette during the 1990s.\n\nHotCars has collected data from multiple sources in order to compile this article on the rarest Chevrolet Corvette from the 1990s, including Hagerty's Valuation Tool, Chevrolet, GM Authority, and Fastest Laps.\n\nChevrolet\n\nChevrolet, or Chevy as it's often called, is a household name and a major division of General Motors. Founded in 1911, Chevy established itself as an affordable carmaker, offering reliable vehicles for everyday drivers.\n\nParent Corporation General Motors\n\nDivisions Chevrolet Performance\n\nFounded 1911\n\nFounder Louis Chevrolet and William C.

Sure, it lacks the beauty of those chrome-clad classics from the '50s and '60s, and yet it still misses out on the bonkers performance that more recent Corvettes benefit from. However, that doesn't mean the C4 deserves to be overlooked. Its styling is oh-so of the '80s and '90s, with pop-up headlights and rakish lines, plus it sports a 350ci V8, rear-wheel drive, and a manual transmission - what's not to love?\n\nClearly, there was plenty to love, as the C4's production spanned from 1984 right through to 1996, with over 350,000 examples finding homes during that period. Of those 350,000 though, a few highly-limited special edition cars were sold. For example, in 1996, 5,412 Collector's Edition Corvettes were sold, while in 1995 Chevy produced just 527 Indianapolis 500 Pace Car Editions, and two years prior, in 1993, even fewer Corvette ZR-1 40th Anniversary Editions were built, with just 448 units ever being made.\n\nThose are incredibly low production numbers, and now those models are highly sought after by collectors today. Although, they're not the rarest of the decade. That title belongs to the 1996 Grand Sport, and specifically, the convertible. Chevrolet produced a total of 1,000 units, with 810 of those being coupes, leaving just 190 convertibles for collectors and enthusiasts to snap up.\n\nAdd HotCars to your Google News feed.\n\nFollow On\n\nGoogle News\n\nGrand Sport Corvettes Are Easily Distinguishable, Thanks To Unique External Enhancements\n\nThe Grand Sport was developed to commemorate the end of the C4 Corvette model run and thus was launched in the final year, 1996. As the purpose of this trim was likely just to find some interest in the aging model, before the exciting new C5 launched, Chevrolet sure worked hard to ensure the Grand Sport, or GS for short, stood out.\n\nFrom the outside, a GS model is instantly recognizable thanks to the signature Admiral Blue paint, white stripes, and red 'hash mark' on the fender. The origin of that hash mark hails from the golden age of motorsport, where a red hash would be placed onto the front of race cars to indicate which side the steering wheel was on. Useful for Le Mans racing, as drivers would have to sprint at the start of the race in order to enter their cars, and knowing which side to get in would save valuable seconds.\n\nThe GS models also benefit from unique perforated leather sports seats, 17\" five-spoke aluminum wheels with black brake calipers behind them, which boasted raised \"Corvette\" lettering for extra detail, in addition to extra chromed \"Corvette\" emblems on the hood and fuel door.\n\n1:45\n\nRelated\n\nOnly 2 Of These Ultra-Rare 1969 Corvettes Were Ever Made\n\nThe ZL1 was a mighty Corvette, one that boasted an estimated 550 horsepower and a production run of just two.\n\nA Closer Look At What's Under The Hood Of A 1996 Corvette Grand Sport Convertible\n\nEngine & Performance Specs\n\nConfiguration\n\nSmall block V8\n\nDisplacement\n\n5.7-liter\n\nAspiration\n\nNaturally aspirated\n\nPower\n\n330 horsepower\n\nTorque\n\n340 lb-ft\n\n0 to 60 mph\n\n5.1 seconds\n\nTop speed\n\n168 mph\n\nTransmission\n\nZF 6-speed manual\n\n(Specs courtesy of Chevrolet & Fastest Laps)\n\nWhile older C4 Corvettes made do with the LT1 V8 (unless you opted for the LT5-powered ZR1), the '96 GS was blessed with the 5.7-liter LT4 under the huge clamshell hood. Power was ample, with 330 horses and 340 lb-ft of torque at the driver's disposal. This resulted in sharp performance, most notably off of the line, as the C4 GS boasted an impressive 0 to 60 mph time of just 5.1 seconds. Top end, the GS could achieve speeds north of 165 mph.\n\nHowever, it was more than just a toy for straight-line speed. The C4 GS came as standard with a 6-speed manual ZF transmission, so it was clearly tailored from the get-go for real driving enthusiasts. The GS also boasted slightly different suspension from base models, in order to live up to that performance-orientated title, \"Grand Sport\".\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Rarest Chevrolet Engine Ever Produced\n\nBack in the early '60s, Chevy unleashed a 427 V8 that would go on to be the rarest motor in it's history. This Z11 unit was estimated to make well north of 500 horsepower and pound-feet of torque making it a favorite in the drag-racing community. If they could get their hands on one as fewer than 60 were ever put together. What would you do with such a rare gem of an engine if you had the chance to enjoy one?\n\nHere's What To Pay For The Rarest Production Corvette From The 1990s\n\nPricing Details\n\nHagerty Condition\n\n1996 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Convertible Value\n\n1996 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Coupe Value\n\nConcours\n\n$70,600\n\n$68,200\n\nExcellent\n\n$47,800\n\n$44,100\n\nGood\n\n$27,000\n\n$23,400\n\nFair\n\n$17,300\n\n$14,900\n\n(Pricing data obtained from Hagerty's Valuation Tool)\n\nRare Chevrolet Corvettes can fetch monumental figures at auction, with the scarcest easily commanding over $3 million. Don't worry though, if you're keen on adding a C4 GS to your collection, your wallet need not be so deep.\n\nThe scarcer convertible does boast a premium over the coupe, but not by as much as you may first think. Concours examples fetch $70,600, in comparison to the coupe's $68,200. In contrast, at the cheaper end of the market, convertibles in fair condition command $17,300, whereas a coupe would require $14,900 in such condition.\n\nMost will fall between good and excellent condition, and, depending on the exact model, somewhere between $25,000 and $50,000 would easily net you one in that good-to-excellent condition range.\n\n2:18\n\nRelated\n\nThe Rarest Chevrolet Corvette Built In The 1950s\n\nThe early years of Corvette saw Chevrolet build some very low-volume cars. We've dug down and found the rarest of them all.\n\nChevrolet Also Developed This Unique V12-Powered Corvette Prototype In The 1990s\n\nWhile the 1996 Grand Sport convertible is the rarest production Corvette from the 1990s, Chevrolet did produce one particularly awesome concept. Known as the ZR-12, this C4 was developed in response to the then-new Dodge Viper, which famously boasted an 8.0-liter V10.\n\nKeen not to be one-upped, Chevrolet supplied the ZR-12 with a monstrous 600ci (that's 9.8-liter) V12 engine. The V12 churned out a supercar-worthy 686 horsepower, in addition to 680 lb-ft of torque, all while checking in at less than 100 lbs heavier than the standard ZR-1 V8. Sadly, the ZR-12 rarely sees the light of day, and is largely unknown. If Chevrolet had pushed the go-button and produced the ZR-12, the Corvette as we know it could be a totally different car today.\n\nSources: Chevrolet, Hagerty, Fastest Laps, TopSpeed, CarBuzz, GM Authority", "source": {"uri": "hotcars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotCars"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_clougher@hotcars.com", "name": "Daniel Clougher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Sport_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Sport Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Convertible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro\u00ebn_C4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Citro\u00ebn C4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_small-block_engine_(first-_and_second-generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet small-block engine (first- and second-generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_C._Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William C.

For Sydnie Christmas, 28, it is not the thought of appearing on the live show that is worrying her to tears, it is actually emotional joy that has moved her after one of her music idols endorsed her talents and followed her on social media. Her rendition of 'Tomorrow' from the musical Annie had moved audiences and judge Amanda Holden was so impressed by her audition that she hit the Golden Buzzer and sent Sydnie straight through to the live semi-finals. In the live shows, Sydnie has already impressed with her version of Frank Sinatra's 'My Way' and she has now found that this has reached the ears of US singer songwriter Loren Allred and Sydnie took to her Instagram Story to reveal that Loren was one of her favourite artists. After Loren followed her on social media, the BGT star admitted that it had left her tearful, sharing with her 59,000 followers: \"My Idol. Life made.\" Sydnie then added: \"No. No stop it!!! I'm crying on the tube. I love you Loren.\" She will need to have that celebrity backing in her head as she sings in the final as she competes with opera singer Innocent Masuku and Sings Out choir from Northamptonshire. Impressionist Mike Woodhams, magicians Trixy and Jack Rhodes, comedian Alex Mitchell and dance duo Abigail & Afronitaaa complete the line-up, with the prize of a slot in the Royal Variety Performance available. Sydnie will also take on two other Golden Buzzer acts in acrobatic group Ssaulabi Performance Troupe and jump rope act Haribow. Amanda Holden is joined by Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli at the judges desk with viewers at home getting the ultimate choice as to who will win this year's Britain's Got Talent. Despite being tipped to win Britain\u2019s Got Talent tonight, Sydnie has insisted that she will be back at work in the gym tomorrow. There may be fame and fortune just over the horizon, but the singer says she won\u2019t quit her fitness centre job just yet \u2013 because she needs the cash. The 28-year-old laughed: \u201cI\u2019ve already had two weeks off \u2013 and I\u2019m on a zero-hours contract. I have rent to pay!\u201d \u201cIn a year\u2019s time, I hope I\u2019m living my dream,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be doing what I love for a living instead of rolling towels and making shakes!\u201d Bookies have made Sydnie the 2/15 odds-on favourite to scoop the BGT title \u2013 and the \u00a3250,000 cash prize.

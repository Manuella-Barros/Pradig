The Livin' On A Prayer rocker, 62 - who recently gushed that the Stranger Things actress is 'wise beyond her years' - was also accompanied by wife, Dorothea Hurley, during the lavish getaway. Last month in May, it was revealed that Brown, 20, and Bongiovi, 22, secretly tied the knot during an intimate affair - but plan to hold a larger ceremony in the U.S. later this year. Jon relaxed on a lounge chair outside while sporting a pair of black swim trunks, while Dorothea - whom he married in 1989 - rested next to him under a shady umbrella. A black cap was placed on top of his head and the singer completed the look with a pair of brown sunglasses. Millie donned a light blue, one-piece swimsuit that had a cutout on the front and was held up with thin straps that wrapped around her shoulders. The star's brunette locks were parted in the middle, and effortlessly flowed down naturally past her shoulders. At one point while strolling outside, Brown layered the bathing suit with an oversized, yellow button up that was left unfastened at the front. Millie opted for a pair of white-rimmed shades to protect her eyes from the bright sunshine, and also added a pair of mini earrings to accessorize the casual look. Jake also dressed down for the relaxing day by wearing a short-sleeved, white polo shirt as well as white shorts and black sandals. After lounging under the summer sun, the group later grabbed a yummy bite to eat together while spending time on the Mediterranean island. Last month in May, Millie and Jake secretly tied the knot during a small wedding in the United States, per The Sun. A source close to the lovebirds told the outlet that they 'quietly said their vows' but 'are planning a bigger ceremony in the U.S. later this year but now they have legally married and done all the paperwork.' 'It was a very low-key, romantic affair with their closest family with them as they said their vows.' Millie's parents were also in attendance, along with the I'll Be There For You hitmaker. The couple were first linked back in 2021 and announced their engagement last year in April. At the time, Millie uploaded a black and white photo as Jake lovingly wrapped his arms around the actress from behind as she flashed the diamond engagement ring on her finger. 'I've loved you three summers now, honey, I want 'em all,' she wrote, referencing to lyrics from Taylor Swift's song titled, Lover. Before tying the knot, Brown had opened up to WWD about keeping their nuptials lowkey. 'I think probably drawing the curtains, just because there are only so many moments in life that you get only once.' 'And to have everyone's opinions and eyes looking at that just feels unnatural to me,' she said, adding, 'So I feel it's important to keep those things, those small precious moments in life, really close to your chest.' During a recent interview on BBC's The One Show, Jon confirmed Millie and Jake's nuptials and shared his thoughts on the actress. 'It was a very small family wedding and the bride looked gorgeous and Jake is happy as can be,' the rocker expressed. 'Millie's wise beyond her years, wiser than I was at her age. She and Jake are figuring things out together. You talk to them and they say, \"We're developing these [ideas for] films together\" and I'm taken aback.' Bon Jovi also reflected on their marriage while talking to The Sun earlier this month, as well as the couple's plans for children in the future. 'My grandkids will be more English than Italian or my other heritage! How crazy is that? It's a very exciting time,' the singer said. 'My other son (Jesse) just got married so we're welcoming two daughters-in-law into our family.' 'To think that they're carrying on my father's name, my grandfather's and my great-grandfather's...wow!' Jon continued, 'Suddenly, your kids are married and then they're telling you about the prospect of grandbabies...woah. There's no chapter in my book that went this far.' Also earlier this month, Millie jumped to her main Instagram page to confirm her marriage to Jake during a trip to Universal Orlando Resort. The Damsel actress uploaded an assortment of snaps from the fun trip, including a photo as she sported a pair of denim shorts that had 'Wifey' printed on the back. She additionally sported a white cap on top of her head that had the words 'Wife Of The Party' printed in pink lettering. While posing for other images, Brown also flashed a glimpse of her eye-catching, diamond ring on her finger.", "summary": "Jon Bon Jovi was seen joining his daughter-in-law Millie Bobby Brown and son Jake Bongiovi on the island of Sardinia during the newlyweds' honeymoon.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13581969/Jon-Bon-Jovi-CRASHES-Millie-Bobby-Brown-Jake-Bongiovi-honeymoon-Sardinia.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/29/01/86717847-0-image-m-23_1719619715845.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/05/30/7223991170825302994/1024x576_MP4_7223991170825302994.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:17:24", "author": "Editor,Jacqueline Lindenberg", "authors": ["Editor", "Jacqueline Lindenberg"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.345}

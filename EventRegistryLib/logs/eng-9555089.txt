The woman further alleged that her brother and father were also attacked when they came to rescue.\n\nThe petitioners urged the High Court to quash the case in view of settlement reached between the parties and their clean past antecedents.\n\nThe State submitted that in view of amicable settlement between the parties, it has no objection in case the FIR in question is quashed.\n\nThe High Court, after hearing the submissions by the parties, observed that heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot be quashed despite settlement, however, minor incidents or offences, which don't affect the society at large or are personal in nature, stand on a different footing for exercise of inherent powers for quashing of a case.\n\nThe High Court further noted that parties in the case being neighbours intend to put quietus to the proceedings and the settlement shall promote harmony between the them and that the chances of conviction are bleak in view of amicable settlement between the parties.\n\n\"Considering the facts and circumstances, since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties, no useful purpose shall be served by keeping the case pending. Continuation of proceedings would be nothing but an abuse of the process of court,\" the High Court said while quashing the FIR.\n\n\"Petitioners are further directed to plant 50 saplings of trees, which are up to 03 feet in height in the local parks in the residential area within jurisdiction of Police Station Sultanpuri, Delhi after getting in touch with the competent authority,\" the High Court said and added, \"The photographs of planted saplings along with report of IO/SHO concerned shall be forwarded to this court within eight weeks. Further, the upkeep of the saplings/trees shall be undertaken by the authorities concerned.\"", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nitish_k_singh@news9live.com", "name": "Nitish K Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoop_Kumar_Mendiratta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anoop Kumar Mendiratta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_house_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Station house officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacoity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dacoity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Delhi-High-Court-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555089", "eventUri": "eng-9555089", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

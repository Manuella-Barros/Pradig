The actor was honored Friday night as guest performer in a daytime drama series for his part as amnesiac Timothy Robicheaux on Peacock\u2019s \u201cDays of Our Lives,\u201d making him the oldest Daytime Emmy winner. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this. I feel like a spy from nighttime television,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 98 years old. Can you believe it? This really tops off a lifetime of 80 years in the business. If I had known I would have lived this long I would\u2019ve taken better care of myself.\u201d \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d won four trophies, including its fourth consecutive honor as best daytime drama. It\u2019s the second time in the ABC show\u2019s 61-year history that it won four daytime drama trophies in a row. Robert Gossett of \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d won supporting actor honors. The first cousin to the late Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr. was honored for the second straight year for his role as Marshall Ashford. \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d also won the directing and writing categories.

I didn\u2019t like award shows until tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing that doesn\u2019t make sense is that anyone can do this alone. You need a great boss who sees you and hears you. You need a cast that tolerates you. You need a whole village of people that have agreed that they\u2019re not going to let you drown. I\u2019ve have all of that.\u201d A clearly stunned Michelle Stafford of \u201cThe Young and the Restless\u201d won best actress as Phyllis Summers, a trophy she first earned in 2004. \u201cI am honored to be an actor. It is the greatest gig. It is a privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to entertain people.\u201d Van Dyke received a standing ovation as he used a cane to make his way to the stage, accompanied by his wife, Arlene, who held the trophy. \u201cI brought this lady up because she was also on the show,\u201d he said. \u201cShe played the cop who arrested me.\u201d Producer Norman Lear was 100 when he received his final Primetime Emmy nomination in 2022 and died the next year.

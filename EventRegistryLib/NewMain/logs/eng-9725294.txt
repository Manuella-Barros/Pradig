The Alzheimer's Association reports that one in three seniors in the United States will die with Alzheimer's or another dementia.\n\nSome memory decline is a normal part of aging, but problems with memory and thinking that start to impact daily functioning are often a sign of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n\nIn some people, MCI can develop into dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, but it is hard to predict whether a person with MCI will go on to develop dementia.\n\nKatherine Gray, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Society, told Medical News Today that: \"Among the almost a million people living with dementia in the [United Kingdom], we know that no two people have the same journey. Symptoms often progress at different rates and the availability and standard of dementia care across the UK can vary extensively.\"\n\nNow, a team from Amsterdam University Medical Center has developed a model that can predict cognitive decline in people with MCI or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The study appears in the journal Neurology.\n\nWiesje van der Flier, PhD, full professor, scientific director of Amsterdam UMC's Alzheimer Centre, and senior author on the study, told MNT that the model might one day be used to tailor Alzheimer's care for individual patients.\n\n\"I think in the future it can. When patients get a diagnosis, their next question is: what can I expect? Or -- what is my prognosis? This model provides a first attempt to an answer. It provides a prognosis for cognitive decline on an individual basis,\" she told us.\n\nGray also commented that:\n\n\"This is encouraging research as it suggests that researchers can produce a model which is able to predict how the symptoms experienced by people with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease might change. Predicting how these symptoms may change cognition over time is vitally important for those living with dementia and their carers to prepare for the future, ultimately leading to better care.\"\n\nHow researchers developed the model\n\nThe researchers recruited participants from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort for their longitudinal study. In total, 961 people were included, of whom 310 had MCI and 651 had mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Their mean age was 65 years, and 49% of them were women.\n\nAll were amyloid-positive, meaning that the researchers detected amyloid biomarkers in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or on PET scans.\n\nThe researchers used the Mini-Mental State Examination -- a short screening tool that provides an overall measure of cognitive impairment -- to assess the participants at the start and several times during the study.\n\nIn this 5-minute test, a person can achieve a maximum score of 30. Clinicians roughly interpret scores as follows:\n\n25-30: no impairment\n\n20-24: mild dementia\n\n15-20: moderate dementia\n\n14 and below: severe dementia.\n\nOver the course of the study, MMSE scores for all participants decreased, indicating a decline in cognitive abilities.\n\nFor those with MCI, MMSE scores declined from a mean of 26.4 at baseline, to 21 after 5 years. People with mild dementia showed a greater decline, from a starting mean of 22.4, the mean score reduced to 7.8 after 5 years.\n\nFor both groups, cognitive decline accelerated over time.\n\nUsing these scores, together with MRI scan results and biomarkers, the researchers modelled MMSE scores over time for both MCI and mild dementia.\n\n\"This is a really interesting study and provides the foundation for tools which could be highly beneficial to patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families,\" Scott Kaiser, MD, a board-certified geriatrician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT.\n\n\"The study subjects were selected from a large cohort, the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, with a wide range of robust clinical data available and the quality of methodology engaged in the predictive modeling appears to be a real strength of this work,\" he added.\n\n'Starting point for communication between clinician and patient'\n\n\"[Our model] shows how difficult such a prognosis is, and that there remains uncertainty. From research, we know that patients and their families value this information, even if there is uncertainty. This model helps to facilitate doctor-patient communication about this uncertainty,\" said van der Flier.\n\nThe researchers constructed models predicting MMSE, which they then used to estimate time to reach an MMSE of 20 (mild dementia) for those with MCI, and 15 (moderate dementia) for those with mild dementia, using different baseline CSF amyloid and MMSE measurements.\n\nThey also predicted how long it would take to reach these threshold MMSE scores, if a treatment intervention reduced decline by 30%.\n\nVan der Flier explained why they did this, saying that:\n\n\"The predictions can also be used by a clinician to discuss with a patient the potential effect of a treatment. Recently emerging treatments have been shown to reduce the rate of decline by around 30%. Applying this to the model provides a starting point for communication between clinician and patient on the potential benefit.\"\n\nHowever, Karen Miller, PhD, a neuropsychologist and geropsychologist, and senior director of the Brain Wellness and Lifestyle Programs at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in this research, emphasized the uncertainty in the model.\n\n\"While the study is rigorous from a research perspective and comprehensive in terms of variable included (cognitive measures, genetics, brain imaging), the variability for any given patient still leaves the provider with a range of years in terms of any given trajectory for the unique patient,\" she told MNT.\n\nWhen will there be a prototype app for clinicians?\n\n\"We're excited to see how research like this will progress in the future and deliver lasting change to people living with dementia,\" said Gray.\n\nTogether with developing the predictive model, the researchers have also designed a prototype app for clinicians, as van der Flier explained.\n\n\"In the tool (adappt.health) we are currently developing, there is also a communication sheet which is intended for clinicians to share with patients and carers, to explain what the prediction entails. Also, there is patient-facing information about the disease, diagnosis and prognosis,\" she told us.\n\nAlthough this is an early model for predicting cognitive decline in Alzheimer's, Kaiser welcomed the research as a step forward in giving Alzheimer's patients and their carers more information about what to expect following diagnosis:\n\n\"This research lays the foundation for the types of prognostic tools that can not only give us a sense of what might be expected along the road ahead, but also, how we might alter that course by addressing a variety of modifiable risk factors to change the disease trajectory and improve our chances of maintaining higher levels of cognitive health and function over a longer horizon.\"\n\nView the original article on Medical News Today", "source":

New disease-modifying treatments targeting amyloid plaques slow disease progression in the MCI and mild dementia stages of AD.However, the clinical meaningfulness of these medications is debated.\"\n\nPublished in the July 10, 2024, online issue of Neurology\u00ae, the research aimed to address the variability in cognitive decline, which is a pressing concern for patients and caregivers.\n\n\"The rate of cognitive decline varies greatly from person to person, and people are very interested in what to expect from the disease in themselves or their loved ones, so better prediction models are urgently needed,\" said study author Dr. Pieter J. van der Veere of Amsterdam University Medical Center, Netherlands.\n\nThe researchers developed predictive models to estimate how quickly individuals' scores on cognitive tests would decline.\n\nThe team validated these models with data from 961 participants, averaging 65 years old - 310 with mild cognitive impairment and 651 with mild dementia. All subjects had amyloid-beta plaques, an early marker of Alzheimer's, targeted by the new drugs.\n\nCognitive test scores range from 0 to 30. Participants with mild cognitive impairment had scores drop from 26.4 to 21.0 over five years, while those with mild dementia saw scores fall from 22.4 to 7.8 in the same period.\n\nThe models accurately predicted the rate of cognitive decline, although with some degree of uncertainty. For half of those with mild cognitive impairment, actual scores differed by less than two points from predictions, and for mild dementia, by less than three points.\n\nA hypothetical case showed that a person with mild cognitive impairment and a baseline score of 28 would reach moderate dementia (score of 20) in six years.\n\nHowever, with a drug reducing decline by 30%, this stage would be delayed to 8.6 years. For mild dementia with a baseline score of 21, reaching a score of 15 would take 2.3 years, or 3.3 years with the same treatment.\n\n\"Patients with AD and their care partners want to know their future cognitive functioning. Our prediction models can be used to inform patients about their cognitive decline, but our results also indicate that providing a precise prognosis is challenging,\" wrote the researchers.\n\n\"Thus clinicians need to talk about the inherent uncertainty surrounding the predictions with their patients.\n\nThe experts noted that visualizations of the uncertainty can form the basis for meaningful doctor-patient conversations about the predicted cognitive decline.\n\n\"We understand that people with cognitive problems and their care partners are most interested in answers to questions like 'How long can I drive a car?' or 'How long can I keep doing my hobby?'\" said Dr. Van der Veere.\n\n\"In the future, we hope that models will help make predictions about these questions about quality of life and daily functioning.\"\n\n\"But until then, we hope these models will help physicians translate these predicted scores into answers for people's questions.\"\n\n-- -\n\nLike what you read?

Researchers tested these models against actual data from 961 participants, with an average age of 65. Of these, 310 had mild cognitive impairment and 651 had mild dementia, all displaying amyloid-beta plaques in their brains -- an early sign of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nParticipants were assessed using a cognitive test where scores range from zero to 30. Scores above 25 indicate no dementia, 21 to 24 indicate mild dementia, 10 to 20 indicate moderate dementia, and scores below 10 signify severe dementia. Over five years, those with mild cognitive impairment saw their scores drop from 26.4 to 21.0, while those with mild dementia experienced a decline from 22.4 to 7.8.\n\nThe predictive models proved useful but highlighted the uncertainty inherent in forecasting cognitive decline. For half of those with mild cognitive impairment, the difference between predicted and actual scores was less than two points. For those with mild dementia, the difference was less than three points.\n\nIn hypothetical scenarios, a person with mild cognitive impairment, a baseline score of 28, and a certain level of amyloid plaques would be predicted to progress to moderate dementia (a score of 20) in six years. If drug treatments reduced the decline rate by 30%, this progression would be delayed to 8.6 years. For someone with mild dementia and a baseline score of 21, the progression to a score of 15 would take 2.3 years, or 3.3 years with a 30% reduction in decline rate due to treatment.\n\nVan der Veere emphasized the importance of these models in addressing practical concerns from patients and caregivers. \"We understand that people with cognitive problems and their care partners are most interested in answers to questions like 'How long can I drive a car?' or 'How long can I keep doing my hobby?'

The time is now to save this program,\" Luj\u00e1n said, Chair of the Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband. \"It's also critical that we adequately fund the \"rip-and-replace\" program to ensure our country can move forward the effort to remove and replace untrusted technological equipment. This amendment also empowers the FCC to reauction spectrum licenses to free up airwaves and allow more opportunities for the public to access faster internet speeds and more responsive networks.\"\n\n\"Millions of Ohioans rely on the Affordable Connectivity Program for access to online schooling, reaching medical professionals, and other essential tasks. That's why I'm doing all that I can to ensure the ACP has the funding it needs. I'm proud to introduce this amendment with Senator Luj\u00e1n because it reflects a bipartisan consensus of the Senate. I look forward to getting this done,\" Vance said.\n\n\"The Affordable Connectivity Program is an essential tool to keep millions of families, seniors and veterans connected to the high-speed internet that powers the modern economy. Our bipartisan coalition is working together to ensure families don't get disconnected and fall into digital darkness,\" Welch said. \"This bipartisan amendment contains compromises -- but I will keep fighting to make sure this program continues beyond May and does not lapse. It's time for Congress to stop stalling.\"\n\n\"In a state as large as Nevada, access to high-speed internet is a critical lifeline for families to access telemedicine, complete school work, and even run a business. The Affordable Connectivity Program that I helped create has helped more than 275,000 Nevada families access affordable high-speed internet,\" Rosen said. \"I've been working across the aisle to continue funding for this critical program so that hardworking Nevada families don't lose internet access. That's why I'm proud to support this bipartisan amendment to ensure ACP funding can continue.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladailypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LosAlamos Daily Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Connectivity_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Connectivity Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Airline_Control_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IBM Airline Control Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ray_Luj\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universal Service Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Daines", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Daines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wicker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Wicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacky_Rosen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacky Rosen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Commerce_Subcommittee_on_Communications,_Media,_and_Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553991", "eventUri": "eng-9553991", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

There are now 16 Senators from both sides of the aisle, representing millions of people and diverse states, backing this amendment,\" said Luj\u00e1n, Chair of the Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband. \"Congress must take action to save the ACP to lower costs for American families, boost the economy, and promote job creation and economic mobility.\"\n\n\"Millions of Ohioans rely on the Affordable Connectivity Program for access to online schooling, reaching medical professionals, and other essential tasks. That's why I'm doing all that I can to ensure the ACP has the funding it needs. I'm proud to introduce this amendment with Senator Luj\u00e1n because it reflects a bipartisan consensus of the Senate.

It's time for Congress to stop stalling.\"\n\n\"The ACP's current trajectory and cost is unsustainable. We have warned the Biden administration this day would come. That is why I have been fighting to reform the program before it is extended. This tailored legislation will help connect the Mississippians that need broadband access the most to the American dream,\" said Senator Wicker.\n\n\"High-speed affordable internet is essential infrastructure, plain and simple. Whether it's a parent logging on for the work day or a student trying to submit their homework, no family should have to worry if they can afford a stable internet connection,\" said Senator Padilla. \"We must fully fund this program to ensure millions of families can afford to get connected at home.\"\n\n\"The Affordable Connectivity Program has been critical to connecting our most remote and underserved communities to the rest of North Dakota and the world. Our legislation bridges the digital divide by keeping this program funded and operational so every farmer, student, veteran, or senior citizen in North Dakota stays connected. By maintaining affordable access to high-speed internet, we are helping contribute to our state and country's economic growth,\" said Senator Cramer.\n\n\"Every Ohio family and Ohio business deserves affordable high-speed internet,\" said Senator Brown.\"The Affordable Connectivity Program lowers the cost of high-speed internet for one in four Ohio households - from Steubenville to Sandusky. This bipartisan amendment is just common sense - and we need to act immediately to extend it.\"\n\nSenator Luj\u00e1n also announced the support of more than 20 advocacy groups. Their statements of support are available HERE.\n\n\"In modern society, broadband is every bit as essential as food, water, electric, and housing. Without it, families will struggle to access school, work, healthcare, government benefits, the news, or even a social life. There simply isn't time to wait - without immediate action, more than 23 million households could find themselves disconnected from the internet in just weeks. The ACLU is grateful for the efforts of the bipartisan group of Senators who are pushing to ensure American households stay connected,\" said Jenna Leventoff, Senior Policy Counsel, ACLU.\n\n\"The R Street Institute is proud to support this important proposal to extend both Rip and Replace and the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) with an appropriate pay-for. This proposal makes meaningful reforms to target customers most in need and streamline eligibility requirements, which R Street has long supported achieving in a revenue-neutral way. While this will only temporarily extend the ACP, R Street hopes the efforts of the Universal Service Fund (USF) working group continues to find a solution and permanent home for this program within USF,\" said Jonathan Cannon, Policy Counsel Technology & Innovation at the R Street Institute.\n\n\"CWA members strongly support the continuation of the Affordable Connectivity Program which enables critical internet access for millions of American families and supports good jobs in our communities. We are encouraged that a bipartisan group of Senators is working to prevent the ACP from completely shutting down and on a permanent funding solution,\" said Shane Larson, Communications Workers of America Senior Director for Government Affairs and Policy.\n\n\"Many Rip & Replace participants, especially in Western states, including those serving Tribal lands will be forced to decide where to remove covered equipment and not replace it, eliminating services available today, both to their subscribers as well to anyone that roams onto their networks. Tens of millions of 2 customers roam onto these networks while travelling to - and through - impacted areas and will have their connectivity and access to emergency services and 9-1-1 reduced or eliminated altogether... Further, having a broadband connection has become critical to participation in the modern U.S. economy and society. The ACP has been enormously beneficial in helping achieve this reality - the over 23 million American households, including over 4.5 million senior citizens and nearly 1 million veteran households, use this subsidy for affordable broadband services.\" -Excerpt from letter undersigned by the following organizations: Competitive Carriers Association, CTI, INCOMPAS, NATE: The, Communications

(Photo by Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Getty Images)\n\nIn the small North Carolina town of Bryson City, just outside Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Kathleen Wain raises two grandchildren in her subsidized-rent apartment, taking them to sing in a church choir on weekends.\n\nFor the past year and a half, Wain has received a discount on her internet service through a short-term federal program, allowing her grandkids to do online schoolwork and her to do remote banking.\n\nHer bill decreased from $52 a month to about $20 a month. \"I said, 'Cool, I don't have to worry about it anymore.'\"\n\nBut Wain's discount ended in April, after Congress did not extend the pandemic-era Affordable Connectivity Program. She's paying $30 a month since Frontier, her internet provider, has reduced the cost -- for now.\n\n\"There's a lot of people that need it [internet] for a lot of things,\" said Wain, 75. \"I can't even imagine being without it -- I really can't.\"\n\nThe federal Affordable Connectivity Program, launched at the end of 2021, has provided a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service for eligible low-income households and up to $75 for households on qualifying tribal lands.\n\nNow, without additional funding from Congress, more than 23 million households across the country have begun to lose the aid. April was the last fully funded month, with some households receiving partial benefits from their internet service provider through May. Several congressional bills have been introduced to extend the program, but none has advanced yet.\n\nAs Newsline reported in early April, more than 900,000, or 1 in 5, households in North Carolina will be negatively impacted.\n\nSo, what we're going to end up with is a piecemeal kind of approach where some communities figure out solutions -- most of them will not have solutions.\n\n- Angela Siefer, executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance\n\nIn response, some states and localities have expanded their broadband initiatives and programs to help those no longer receiving the federal boost. That could leave disparities in access across the country, experts say, and many households will slip through the cracks as they become unable to afford internet service.\n\nBecause of the high cost, there's no alternative to a dedicated federal benefit program like the Affordable Connectivity Program to solve the problem of affordability, said Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, which advocates for broadband access.\n\n\"So, what we're going to end up with is a piecemeal kind of approach where some communities figure out solutions -- most of them will not have solutions,\" she said.\n\nWhile some states are bolstering programs to help residents afford broadband, others are boosting their infrastructure initiatives to reach those who still can't connect to internet. And some local officials are offering ACP-like benefits through county funds.\n\nAmericans pay more for broadband than almost every other nation in the world. U.S. internet bills average $89 each month, according to a survey of 2,500 Americans late last year by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe federal Lifeline program, started in 1985, is the only other national initiative giving low-income households a discount on phone and internet service. Lifeline, which residents were allowed to use at the same time as the ACP aid, provides a monthly benefit of up to $9.25 for eligible households and up to $34.25 for those on tribal lands.\n\nLast year, nearly all 50 states considered legislation to expand broadband access and affordability for communities nationwide, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. At least 45 enacted legislation.\n\nThis year, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Utah and Washington passed legislation related to state broadband grant programs and initiatives to help with access and affordability, many using federal funds.\n\nNick Batz, the director of the Oregon Broadband Office, said now that the federal Affordable Connectivity Program is gone, his office has shifted its focus to building up broadband infrastructure through the federal $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, created under the 2021 infrastructure law.\n\nBEAD provides grants to expand broadband access through statewide development projects.\n\n\"The challenge ahead of us is tremendous,\" Batz said. \"And it's not something that I can accomplish on my own. It's not something that my team can accomplish on our own. Really, we need engagement from local governments, cities, counties and tribes.\"\n\nAlthough BEAD isn't a benefit program, Aaron Wheeler, the director of the Washington State Broadband Office, is hopeful that it will be able to at least get the 7% of households in the state who are without internet connected.\n\nWhile his office has multiple programs to help households at a statewide level, the federal BEAD program will be especially helpful in identifying the areas most in need, Wheeler said.\n\n\"Everyone's really invested in making sure that BEAD goes well, and that the money goes to the places that it needs to,\" Wheeler said. \"Getting people plugged in is No. 1, and then making sure people can still continue to afford it is No. 2.\"\n\nBut with elections drawing nearer, some state officials expect they'll be working under new administrations. Washington state will have a new governor next year, meaning more negotiations for broadband funding, said Devin Proctor, the policy and communications manager for the Washington State Broadband Office.\n\nOn the local level, some governments have been able to carve out funds to help households pay for broadband. Albemarle County, located in the Piedmont region of Virginia with about 114,000 residents, has invested $1 million in public broadband expansion by building infrastructure throughout the county.\n\nThat, in addition to about $60 million in state, federal and private funding, means the county is on track to have universal broadband coverage -- where every household in the county can access the internet -- by the end of 2025, said Jason Inofuentes, the program manager at the county's Broadband Accessibility and Affordability Office.\n\nBefore the Affordable Connectivity Program ran out of funding, Albemarle County officials created the ACP Bridge program, an additional county benefit for households to use alongside the federal ACP aid. Those enrolled in the program could get an additional $20 per month toward internet services.\n\nRight now, the ACP Bridge has enough funding to last through the next fiscal year, thanks to a $500,000 boost from the county Board of Supervisors, Inofuentes said.\n\nStill, with the federal program at its end, affordability will continue to be an issue, he said. And some residents who need the help may not be aware of the available programs.\n\n\"I think that there is a distinct reality that there are going to be households in our community and all over the country that are going to lose coverage because of this,\" said Inofuentes. \"The way that we see it, we have to work tirelessly to get people enrolled in other programs they can afford.\"\n\nIn some communities, local nonprofits are raising awareness and providing support, said Sean Gonsalves, the associate director for communications at the Community Broadband Networks Initiative, a nationwide project of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a national nonprofit that works to \"build local power to fight corporate control.\"\n\nDespite the Biden administration's push to prioritize funding for municipal broadband, nonprofits and other nontraditional internet providers, these types of providers are restricted in many states, Gonsalves said.\n\n\"The broadband market is dominated by regional monopoly providers -- and that pretty much answers the question as to why broadband in the United States is so expensive,\" he said.\n\nSome nonprofits are helping residents afford broadband.\n\nDigitalC, a technology nonprofit based in Cleveland providing affordable internet for underserved communities, is offering internet for $18 a month under its own Canopy internet service for city residents.\n\nProject Waves, a program fiscally sponsored by the Digital Harbor Foundation based in Baltimore, has been able to offer free internet to low-income residents of the city.\n\nLawmakers and state officials at all levels have been aware for more than a year that the federal Affordable Connectivity Program would run out of funding, Gonsalves said. But there's a lot of uncertainty about how to help now.\n\n\"With ACP -- where 23 million households were beneficiaries -- we still don't have a clear sense of what those folks will do when the benefit expires,\" Gonsalves said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This effort would also fund the program through the end of the year, giving lawmakers more time to find a permanent solution.\n\nCongress established the ACP in 2021 to help families stay afloat during the pandemic, but it has become too expensive to continue as-is indefinitely. Now that the health emergency has ended, Senator Wicker has been fighting to extend the program on the condition that it be reformed to be cost-effective in the long term.\n\n\"The ACP's current trajectory and cost is unsustainable. We have warned the Biden administration this day would come. That is why I have been fighting to reform the program before it is extended. This tailored legislation will help connect the Mississippians that need broadband access the most to the American dream,\" Senator Wicker said.\n\nMore information on the included reforms can be found below:\n\nThe amendment would refine the eligibility criteria for the ACP by lowering the income threshold to 135 percent of the federal poverty line, down from the current 200 percent. Households benefiting from free school meals through the United States Department of Agriculture's Community Eligibility Provision would no longer qualify for this assistance. Additionally, participants must undergo verification through the Federal Communications Commission's eligibility database, including the National Verifier and National Lifeline Accountability Database.\n\nThe proposed legislation would also:\n\nEliminate the one-time $100 device discount under the ACP and direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement strong anti-fraud and performance measures.\n\nAllocate an extra $3 billion to fortify the rip and replace program to ensure the American networks are protected from vulnerable equipment.\n\nRequire the FCC to auction off the AWS-3 bands and any other spectrum bands returned to the agency within a two-year timeframe, regardless of potential reinstatement of auction authority during that period.\n\nSenator Wicker introduced the legislation with U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.), JD Vance (R-Ohio), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.).", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Connectivity_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Connectivity Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Airline_Control_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IBM Airline Control Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wicker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Wicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ray_Luj\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Daines", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Daines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacky_Rosen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacky Rosen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553991", "eventUri": "eng-9553991", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

She's paying $30 a month since Frontier, her internet provider, has reduced the cost -- for now.\n\n\"There's a lot of people that need it [internet] for a lot of things,\" said Wain, 75. \"I can't even imagine being without it -- I really can't.\"\n\nThe federal Affordable Connectivity Program, launched at the end of 2021, has provided a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service for eligible low-income households and up to $75 for households on qualifying tribal lands.\n\nNow, without additional funding from Congress, more than 23 million households across the country have begun to lose the aid. April was the last fully funded month, with some households receiving partial benefits from their internet service provider through May. Several congressional bills have been introduced to extend the program, but none has advanced yet.\n\nAs Newsline reported in early April, more than 900,000, or 1 in 5, households in North Carolina will be negatively impacted.\n\nBecause of the high cost, there's no alternative to a dedicated federal benefit program like the Affordable Connectivity Program to solve the problem of affordability, said Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, which advocates for broadband access.\n\n\"So, what we're going to end up with is a piecemeal kind of approach where some communities figure out solutions -- most of them will not have solutions,\" she said.\n\nWhile some states are bolstering programs to help residents afford broadband, others are boosting their infrastructure initiatives to reach those who still can't connect to internet. And some local officials are offering ACP-like benefits through county funds.\n\nAmericans pay more for broadband than almost every other nation in the world. U.S. internet bills average $89 each month, according to a survey of 2,500 Americans late last year by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe federal Lifeline program, started in 1985, is the only other national initiative giving low-income households a discount on phone and internet service. Lifeline, which residents were allowed to use at the same time as the ACP aid, provides a monthly benefit of up to $9.25 for eligible households and up to $34.25 for those on tribal lands.\n\nLast year, nearly all 50 states considered legislation to expand broadband access and affordability for communities nationwide, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. At least 45 enacted legislation.\n\nThis year, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Utah and Washington passed legislation related to state broadband grant programs and initiatives to help with access and affordability, many using federal funds.\n\nNick Batz, the director of the Oregon Broadband Office, said now that the federal Affordable Connectivity Program is gone, his office has shifted its focus to building up broadband infrastructure through the federal $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, created under the 2021 infrastructure law.\n\nBEAD provides grants to expand broadband access through statewide development projects.\n\n\"The challenge ahead of us is tremendous,\" Batz said. \"And it's not something that I can accomplish on my own. It's not something that my team can accomplish on our own. Really, we need engagement from local governments, cities, counties and tribes.\"\n\nAlthough BEAD isn't a benefit program, Aaron Wheeler, the director of the Washington State Broadband Office, is hopeful that it will be able to at least get the 7% of households in the state who are without internet connected.\n\nWhile his office has multiple programs to help households at a statewide level, the federal BEAD program will be especially helpful in identifying the areas most in need, Wheeler said.\n\n\"Everyone's really invested in making sure that BEAD goes well, and that the money goes to the places that it needs to,\" Wheeler said. \"Getting people plugged in is No. 1, and then making sure people can still continue to afford it is No. 2.\"\n\nBut with elections drawing nearer, some state officials expect they'll be working under new administrations. Washington state will have a new governor next year, meaning more negotiations for broadband funding, said Devin Proctor, the policy and communications manager for the Washington State Broadband Office.\n\nOn the local level, some governments have been able to carve out funds to help households pay for broadband. Albemarle County, located in the Piedmont region of Virginia with about 114,000 residents, has invested $1 million in public broadband expansion by building infrastructure throughout the county.\n\nThat, in addition to about $60 million in state, federal and private funding, means the county is on track to have universal broadband coverage -- where every household in the county can access the internet -- by the end of 2025, said Jason Inofuentes, the program manager at the county's Broadband Accessibility and Affordability Office.\n\nBefore the Affordable Connectivity Program ran out of funding, Albemarle County officials created the ACP Bridge program, an additional county benefit for households to use alongside the federal ACP aid. Those enrolled in the program could get an additional $20 per month toward internet services.\n\nRight now, the ACP Bridge has enough funding to last through the next fiscal year, thanks to a $500,000 boost from the county Board of Supervisors, Inofuentes said.\n\nStill, with the federal program at its end, affordability will continue to be an issue, he said. And some residents who need the help may not be aware of the available programs.\n\n\"I think that there is a distinct reality that there are going to be households in our community and all over the country that are going to lose coverage because of this,\" said Inofuentes. \"The way that we see it, we have to work tirelessly to get people enrolled in other programs they can afford.\"\n\nIn some communities, local nonprofits are raising awareness and providing support, said Sean Gonsalves, the associate director for communications at the Community Broadband Networks Initiative, a nationwide project of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a national nonprofit that works to \"build local power to fight corporate control.\"\n\nDespite the Biden administration's push to prioritize funding for municipal broadband, nonprofits and other nontraditional internet providers, these types of providers are restricted in many states, Gonsalves said.\n\n\"The broadband market is dominated by regional monopoly providers -- and that pretty much answers the question as to why broadband in the United States is so expensive,\" he said.\n\nSome nonprofits are helping residents afford broadband.\n\nDigitalC, a technology nonprofit based in Cleveland providing affordable internet for underserved communities, is offering internet for $18 a month under its own Canopy internet service for city residents.\n\nProject Waves, a program fiscally sponsored by the Digital Harbor Foundation based in Baltimore, has been able to offer free internet to low-income residents of the city.\n\nLawmakers and state officials at all levels have been aware for more than a year that the federal Affordable Connectivity Program would run out of funding, Gonsalves said. But there's a lot of uncertainty about how to help now.\n\n\"With ACP -- where 23 million households were beneficiaries -- we still don't have a clear sense of what those folks will do when the benefit expires,\" Gonsalves said.", "source": {"uri": "ncnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NC Newsline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The NTIA has also approved the District of Columbia's and Deleware's initial proposals.\n\nAccording to a news release from NTIA, the BEAD program is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's \"Internet for All\" initiative.\n\nThe approval means Washington can request access to its allocation of BEAD funding -- over $1.2 billion. The state can also start implementing the BEAD program, according to the NTIA.\n\nThe BEAD program, as stated by the news release, is a $42.5 billion state grant program through President Joe Biden's infrastructure law to provide everyone in the country access to reliable, affordable, high-speed internet.\n\nLast month, the White House pushed Congress to extend funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) through the Federal Communication Commission, which allowed a $30 internet discount for those who qualify as low-income.\n\nBackground: Affordable internet program may end for millions; these are other local options\n\nHowever, without funding from Congress, the last fully funded month was April 2024. Over 300,000 Washingtonians will be impacted by the end of the ACP.\n\n\"Without action from Congress, this program will sunset this spring and millions of Americans may no longer be able to afford high-speed internet service,\" wrote a post by the White House.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Senator for California Alex Padilla announced that he cosponsored the ACP Extension Act, according to a news release from Padilla.

This bipartisan amendment is just common sense - and we need to act immediately to extend it.\"\n\nThe amendment, which is led by U.S. Senators Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-NM), JD Vance (R-OH), Peter Welch (D-VT), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roger Wicker (R-MS) also includes U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-CA), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Gary Peters (D-MI), James Risch (R-ID), Roger Marshall (R-KS), John Fetterman (D-PA), and Laphonza Butler (D-CA).\n\nThe Affordable Connectivity Program reduces the cost of high-speed internet for more than one million Ohio households - in rural, suburban, and urban communities across the state. Brown's bipartisan, bicameral Affordable Connectivity Program Extension Act would fully fund the program that was created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Brown helped to write and pass.\n\nBrown has long been an advocate for high-speed internet infrastructure. In August, he announced a $162.5 million federal investment for high-speed internet infrastructure and community projects in Ohio under the American Rescue Plan's Capital Projects Fund (CPF). In June, he announced a massive investment to expand high-speed internet access to bring high-speed internet to 183,000 Ohio households. In October, anticipating the depletion of Affordable Connectivity Program funding, Brown joined 31 of his colleagues urging Congressional leadership to immediately provide additional funding for the program.\n\nSee State-by-State level data on the Affordable Connectivity Program here.

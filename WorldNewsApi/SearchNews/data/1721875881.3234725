Without question, Coach Reid has proudly owned his passion for cheeseburgers, celebrating big victories with the fast-food favourite and often engaging in heated debates over the best burgers on several podcasts. So, when State Farm was scouting for an ambassador to shoot a commercial in a junk food establishment, Reid was undoubtedly their man. The insurance giant, in collaboration with Reid, and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, spun their entire ad around the humble burger. Reid, who sat opposite Mahomes and \"Jake from State Farm\" for the shoot, revealed how he demolished 60 burgers during filming. Reid told Complex Sports: \"We did a hamburger shoot. I made a pact to myself, just being a cheeseburger connoisseur, that I wouldn't use the spit bucket. But after about the 60th cheeseburger, I had to go there.\" READ MORE: Travis Kelce's family shows what they really think of Taylor Swift at Eras TourREAD MORE: Tom Brady shares Bill Belichick secret only New England Patriots saw in NFL dressing room While laughing Reid then added: \"The producer wanted me to do my lines with my mouth full of cheeseburger.

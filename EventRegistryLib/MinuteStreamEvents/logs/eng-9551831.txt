Jon Tester (D-Mont.) faced ridicule from former president Donald Trump over the weekend when he called the senator 'pregnant.' Trump said the disparaging things at a fundraiser for White House physician Rep. Ronnie Jackson (R-Texas) at a private event at his Mar-a-Lago club and estate in South Florida. As per Politico, the presumed GOP candidate for 2024 chased the senior lawmaker, claiming that he 'looks pregnant to me.' In a video that the publication received, Trump was mocking Tester by stating, \"Have you ever seen this guy? He doesn't look like a fat guy, except that his stomach is out.\"\n\nTrump's criticism of Tester, who is facing a difficult re-election battle this year against notorious far-right businessman Tim Sheehy, sparked an outpouring of rage on social media. One user wrote on X, \"Trump really shouldn't be the one saying that considering how he isn't exactly petite.\" A second user commented, \"Seriously, does Trump own a mirror. He's grossly over weight. His hair is ridiculously in color and style. His bronzer is clownish. That suit he wears is dirty and wrinkled.\"\n\nOne of the most exposed Democratic incumbents in this campaign, Tester is a prime target for Republicans hoping to retake the Senate. He is one of only two Democrats in a state that Trump won in 2020, and he is running for reelection this year. Trump, however, is endorsing Tim Sheehy, the Republican challenger.\n\nTester has tried to project an image of himself as someone who would challenge both parties, and he has alternated between complimenting and condemning Trump. Since Republicans have swept Montanan elections lately, Tester is the last Democrat in statewide office who is running for office a fourth time in one of just four U.S. Senate contests that The Cook Political Report has classified as a 'toss-up.'\n\nSen. Tester was also called out by Trump last month for opposing White House physician Ronny Jackson's nomination to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Tester expressed alarm about claims made against Jackson, including that he handled prescription painkillers carelessly, was inebriated when traveling abroad, and fostered a hostile work environment. Trump mentioned in various tweets at the time, \"Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign.\"\n\nHe further added, \"The great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!\"\n\nJackson first chose not to address every accusation, although he did refute a few, such as the claim that he damaged a government vehicle. As reported by CNN, shortly after Jackson withdrew, Trump said in a Fox News interview that Tester may have a 'big price to pay in Montana' for opposing the nomination.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Sheehy_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Sheehy (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Political_Report_with_Amy_Walter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronny_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronny Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Admiral (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/692109/uploads/ec18a3d0-0c66-11ef-9626-5df4037eded2_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551831", "eventUri": "eng-9551831", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Ronny Jackson (R-TX).\n\nIn a video obtained by Politico, Trump could be heard saying that while Tester was not fat-looking, he emphasized that the stomach of the official was out, demonstrating what he alleged to have seen with both of his hands.\n\n\"Have you seen this guy? He doesn't look like a fat guy, except his stomach is out to here,\" said the former President.\n\n\"Not that I talk about things like that. I don't even notice them,\" he quickly added, based on Washington Post.\n\nTester's camp did not respond to a request for a comment on the statements of Trump.\n\nTester was considered to be among the most vulnerable incumbents among the Democrats, and many Republicans are targeting him so that they could once more gain control of the Senate. Tester is one of the two Democrats who seeks to be reelected in a state where Trump actually won in the 2022 elections. Apparently, the former President has already endorsed Tim Sheehy, the opponent of Tester.\n\nTo win the elections, Tester must be able to win Trump supporters to his side. Tester has noticeably been trying to present himself as someone who can stand up against both parties. He also has volleyed between praising the former president and openly criticizing him.\n\nTrump has been known to disparage political opponents over their appearances. Women or men, Trump has not made a distinction when it comes to throwing criticisms on their physical attributes.\n\nThe rift between Trump and Tester goes back to the time when the former president nominated Rep. Ronnie Jackson (R-TX), then White House physician, to serve as his Veterans Affairs secretary. However, this was put in the backburner when Tester, who was then serving as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, helped in preventing the nomination. Tester cited reports made by people who used to know Jackson in the Navy, and who alleged that the doctor handed out prescriptions \"like candy.\"\n\nWith the elections nearing, Jackson has also openly criticized Tester, calling him \"two-faced.\"\n\n\"I thank President Trump for reminding the audience how critical this election is and to vote out two-faced, Far Left candidates like Jon Tester,\" said Jackson in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ann_resuma@ibtimes.com", "name": "Ann Resuma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronny_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronny Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States House of Representatives elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4524990/former-us-president-donald-trump-denies-having-sexual-enounter-porn-actress-stormy-daniels.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551831", "eventUri": "eng-9551831", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Jon Tester of Montana looked \"pregnant.\"\n\nThe comment came Saturday from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home and club in Palm Beach, Florida, The Washington Post reported Monday.\n\nAccording to the report, the former president was holding an event for the re-election campaign of Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas.\n\nJackson, who was the White House physician for Trump and other presidents, left his post in 2019 and successfully ran a campaign in the 13th Congressional District in Texas.\n\nUp for a third term, Jackson joined Trump in South Florida, where the former president suggested that he and Jackson should campaign in Montana together against Tester - with whom the congressman has a history.\n\n\"He's now in a tough campaign, and he could very well lose,\" Trump said of the senator. \"We ought to go up and campaign against him.\"\n\nTrump then said, \"In fact, I looked at him, and I said, 'Oh, this finally works for a man or woman, because he looks pregnant to me.'\"\n\nAccording to the Post, the Mar-a-Lago crowd laughed at Tester's expense.\n\nTrump was not yet finished.\n\n\"Have you seen this guy?\" the former president said of the Montana Democrat. \"He doesn't look like a fat guy, except his stomach is out to here.\"\n\n\"Not that I talk about things like that. I don't even notice them,\" he said.\n\nChris LaCivita, a senior campaign adviser to Trump, told the Post of the comment, \"Well, according to the left, men can [be pregnant]. So where is the controversy?\"\n\nJackson withdrew a bid to head the Department of Veterans Affairs in April 2018 after Trump had nominated him for the role.\n\nTester, then the ranking member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, was among several Senate Democrats who investigated Jackson and unearthed claims from people who had worked with him that the physician had a history of overprescribing medication and would sometimes abuse alcohol and become \"toxic\" to work for, CNN reported.\n\nAt the time, Jackson -- a rear admiral in the Navy -- described the allegations as \"completely false\" and defended his record.\n\n\"If [the allegations] had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over the past 12 years,\" he said.\n\nTester did not comment on Trump's reported remarks about his appearance at Saturday's fundraiser.\n\nThe Democrat will face off against the winner of the GOP primary -- conservative businessman Tim Sheehy is the favorite -- in a November race that could decide the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nA J.L. Partners poll conducted in March showed the incumbent trailing Sheehy 48-45 percent, with 7 percent of voters undecided.\n\nTester was first elected to represent Montana in the Senate in 2006, but the state voted overwhelmingly for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jon Tester appears to be changing his tune on supporting the Republican-led Laken Riley Act, named after the 22-year-old nursing student who was allegedly murdered by an illegal alien in February on the University of Georgia's campus.\n\nTester voted with Democrats on March 23 in blocking GOP Sen. Ted Budd's amendment he described as being a \"modified version\" of the Laken Riley Act to the second government funding package. The senator is now co-sponsoring the bill, according to a press release on Thursday, which would require federal officials to detain illegal aliens who commit \"burglary, theft, larceny, or [a] shoplifting offense.\"\n\n\"Keeping Montana safe is my top priority, which is why I've repeatedly called on the Biden Administration and Congress to do more to secure the southern border and have worked to get the brave men and women in law enforcement what they need to keep criminals off our streets,\" Tester said in a statement provided to the DCNF.\n\n\"After hearing from law enforcement officers across Montana, I'm backing the Laken Riley Act to make sure that individuals who enter our country and commit a crime are held accountable so that no Montana family has to worry about the safety of their loved ones,\" Tester added.\n\nA spokesperson for Tester told the Belgrade News on March 29 that he would support the Laken Riley Act as a standalone bill.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act was introduced by Republican Georgia Rep. Mike Collins who represents the district where the student was killed. The legislation passed the House on March 7, but has yet to face a floor vote in the Senate.\n\nTester has attempted to paint himself as a Democrat who is tough on border security and illegal immigration while running for reelection in a state former President Donald Trump won by double digits both cycles. The senator launched a TV ad in early April arguing he \"worked with Republicans, fighting to shut down the border,\" but some of his voting record shows otherwise.\n\nRepublican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have dubbed the senator \"two-faced Tester\" in regard to his changing stances on illegal immigration.\n\nA J.L. Partners survey conducted in late March found Sheehy leading Tester by three points in a head-to-head matchup, with 7% of likely voters remaining undecided. The race is characterized by The Cook Political Report as in the \"Toss-Up\" category for 2024, along with Democratic Sens. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and an open seat in Arizona.\n\nTester's campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.", "source":

Tester is one of two incumbent Democratic senators running for reelection in states that Donald Trump won in 2020.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to detain migrants who are \"unlawfully present in the United States\" and are \"arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.\" The bill also authorizes states to sue the federal government for \"decisions or alleged failures related to immigration enforcement.\"\n\nThe legislation is named after a young woman who was allegedly murdered by a man who illegally crossed the border and had previously been arrested in connection with a shoplifting case, but was later released by authorities.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And now he's for the bill... So, he was against it before he was for it?! You know how worried Jon Tester must be about his re-election!!\"\n\nThe claim that Tester previously voted against the bill is misleading.\n\nThe full Laken Riley Act has not yet reached the Senate for a roll call vote, but Tester did previously vote against inserting similar language that's found in the Laken Riley Act into a package of legislation to keep funding the government.\n\nThat amendment was one of a handful that put the government at risk of shutting down. If the Laken Riley amendment would have passed, the bill would have to return to the House for a vote, which would have triggered a partial government shutdown.\n\nThis is not the first time his challenger has claimed Tester voted against the bill: Since that vote on the appropriations package, Sheehy and other prominent Republicans have frequently claimed that Tester voted against the Laken Riley Act.\n\nImmigration through the southern border has been dominating the rhetoric from politicians up and down the ballot in Montana over the last few months. Last week, a migrant family arrived in the Flathead Valley, which spurred multiple top Montana Republicans to shoot off statements around the security of the southern border, in part blaming a small local nonprofit that connects immigrants to resources. Distinct groups of Republican members of the legislature also called for a special legislative session in part to address immigration via the southern border.\n\nVictoria Eavis is a reporter for the Montana State News Bureau.\n\n0 Comments You must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.

We ought to go up and campaign against him. In fact, I looked at him, and I said, 'Oh, this finally works for a man or woman, because he looks pregnant to me.'\" The crowd laughing, the ex-president added, \"Have you seen this guy? He doesn't look like a fat guy, except his stomach is out to here. Not that I talk about things like that. I don't even notice them,\" according to a recording of his remarks obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nYou might be wondering why the former president mocked Tester in the first place. Was the fundraiser in question for a candidate running against the Montana senator? Has Tester made being thin a cornerstone of his campaign? It may or may not surprise you to hear that the answers are no and no. Rather, the fundraiser was for Texas GOP representative Ronny Jackson, who the Post notes \"has had a long-running feud with Tester,\" and since Trump is a schoolyard bully, he decided to pile on. (The feud in question stems from Tester alleging misconduct on Jackson's part while Jackson was serving as White House doctor; multiple allegations against Jackson, including inappropriate use of alcohol on presidential trips and bullying of subordinates, were later substantiated by an investigation by the Defense Department inspector general. Jackson claimed the report was politically motivated.)\n\nThe idea that Trump does not \"talk about\" people's weight, as he reportedly claimed Saturday, is, of course, bullshit. For one thing, he was literally talking about -- and mocking -- Tester's weight in that very moment. For another, a small sampling of other times he's denigrated people's bodies reportedly includes:\n\nAccording to a 2016 story in The Washington Post, Trump \"kept a 'fat photo' of one employee whose weight fluctuated in a drawer and told an overweight executive, 'you like your candy.'\" For his part, the ex-president reportedly \"considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy,\" and famously subsists on a diet of fast food.\n\nIn a statement, a Trump campaign adviser told the Post on Monday, of Trump's comments about Tester: \"Well, according to the left, men can [get pregnant]. So where is the controversy?\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronny_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronny Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/663a81783e3546e5d15e13e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/2089689877?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551831", "eventUri": "eng-9551831", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

From campaigning for President of the United States to defending himself against 34 felony counts and more, it's no wonder headlines abound of his falling asleep in court. No matter how busy he may be, Trump has always found the time to keep up with a favorite pastime: body-shaming.\n\nThe latest recipient of this ugly Trump insult subset is Montana Sen. Jon Tester. Trump brought up Tester at a fundraiser for Rep. Ronny Jackson, his former off-the-rails White House doctor, at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. Trump decided to attack Tester because he is the incumbent Democrat in a closely watched election campaign, likely facing Republican Tim Sheehy, whom Trump has endorsed.\n\nAlthough criticizing a political opponent is fair game, Trump's particular line of attack is yet another reminder of how Trump is, first and foremost, a shameless bully. After threatening to campaign against Tester in his home state, Trump quickly proceeded to attack the senator -- not for his record or his policies, but for his figure.\n\n\"Have you ever seen this guy?\" Trump asked the assemblage, holding his hands out to convey a mental image, according to a video obtained by The Washington Post. \"He doesn't look like a fat guy, except that his stomach is out.\"\n\nWhen I last wrote about Trump's penchant for body-shaming, then-presidential hopeful Chris Christie was in the crosshairs, with Trump playfully claiming that Christie \"can't be bothered\" because \"[h]e's eating right now.\" Tester is the latest name in Trump's long history of body-shaming.

Jon Tester appears to be changing his tune on supporting the Republican-led Laken Riley Act, named after the 22-year-old nursing student who was allegedly murdered by an illegal alien in February on the University of Georgia's campus.\n\nTester voted with Democrats on March 23 in blocking GOP Sen. Ted Budd's amendment he described as being a \"modified version\" of the Laken Riley Act to the second government funding package. The senator is now co-sponsoring the bill, the Daily Caller News Foundation confirmed on Thursday, which would require federal officials to detain illegal aliens who commit \"burglary, theft, larceny, or [a] shoplifting offense.\"\n\n\"Keeping Montana safe is my top priority, which is why I've repeatedly called on the Biden Administration and Congress to do more to secure the southern border and have worked to get the brave men and women in law enforcement what they need to keep criminals off our streets,\" Tester said in a statement provided to the DCNF.\n\n\"After hearing from law enforcement officers across Montana, I'm backing the Laken Riley Act to make sure that individuals who enter our country and commit a crime are held accountable so that no Montana family has to worry about the safety of their loved ones,\" Tester added. (RELATED: Dem Senator Launches Ad Pitching Himself As Tough On Border -- Despite Repeatedly Voting Down Security Measures)\n\nA spokesperson for Tester told the Belgrade News on March 29 that he would support the Laken Riley Act as a standalone bill.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act was introduced by Republican Georgia Rep. Mike Collins who represents the district where the student was killed. The legislation passed the House on March 7, but has yet to face a floor vote in the Senate.\n\nTester has attempted to paint himself as a Democrat who is tough on border security and illegal immigration while running for reelection in a state former President Donald Trump won by double digits both cycles. The senator launched a TV ad in early April arguing he \"worked with Republicans, fighting to shut down the border,\" but some of his voting record shows otherwise.\n\nRepublican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have dubbed the senator \"two-faced Tester\" in regard to his changing stances on illegal immigration.\n\nA J.L. Partners survey conducted in late March found Sheehy leading Tester by three points in a head-to-head matchup, with 7% of likely voters remaining undecided. The race is characterized by The Cook Political Report as in the \"Toss-Up\" category for 2024, along with Democratic Sens. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and an open seat in Arizona.\n\nTester's campaign did not immediately respond to the DCNF's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, confronted Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin over the migrant crisis at the southern border during a sharp exchange on Capitol Hill.\n\nTester, who is one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, let Austin know in blunt terms that he's fed up with the Biden administration's failure to secure the border, though he also acknowledged that Congress's failure to pass border security reforms is also a problem.\n\n\"Look, I've repeatedly called upon [Homeland Security] Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas and President Biden and Congress to step up and fix what's going on at the southern border. It's not sustainable at all and it's unacceptable,\" he told Austin sternly during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nTester noted the Biden administration has had to rely on the Department of Defense to keep the border secure, diverting billions of dollars a year away from regular military priorities.\n\n\"I don't see any funding for [Department of Defense] personnel for those operations. So, Mr. Secretary, a couple things. Number one, how many troops are currently serving on the southern border?\" Tester demanded.\n\nAustin responded that the Pentagon has had to help shore up border security officers for 19 of the past 23 years at a cost of $4 billion but didn't provide a precise timeframe for the cost.\n\nTester then pressed Austin on whether this is a good use of military resources.\n\n\"Mr. Secretary, do you agree with my perspective that the Administration needs to do more secure the border, and we shouldn't have to depend upon the military to do that?\" he asked.\n\nAustin admitted that he agreed but quickly added, \"but if we're required to assist, then we will continue to do so.\"\n\nHe added, \"the president agrees more should be done,\" and pointed out that Biden supported the bipartisan Senate border security deal that would have allocated $20 billion toward border security.\n\nTester acknowledged, \"Congress dropped the ball on that because that would have changed things dramatically.\"\n\nTester's stern exchange with Austin follows a confrontation he had with Mayorkas last month over the administration's failure to better control the border.\n\n\"All you have to see is what's gone on at the southern border, and you know that we're in a situation that needs immediate repair, immediate fixing, immediate overhaul,\" Tester said during a tense moment of a hearing with Mayorkas.\n\n\"The fact is the border needs to be fixed, and we need to step up as Congress, the administration needs to step up, you need to step up,\" Tester said, his voice rising in volume.\n\nTester announced Thursday that he had officially co-sponsored the Laken Riley Act, which would require federal officials to apprehend and detain illegal immigrants who commit certain crimes until they can be removed from the United States.\n\n\"After hearing from law enforcement officers across Montana, I'm backing the Laken Riley Act to make sure that individuals who enter our country and commit a crime are held accountable so that no Montana family has to worry about the safety of their loved ones,\" Tester said in a statement.\n\nTester became the first Democrat to co-sponsor the bill, which has strong Republican support and which the House passed with 251 votes in March.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jon Tester will continue his efforts to distinguish himself as a border security hard-liner on Thursday by becoming the first Senate Democrat to back an immigration bill that has been championed by Republicans in both chambers of Congress.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tester will announce his intention to co-sponsor the Laken Riley Act, a bill named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed while out on a run near the University of Georgia campus in February. Authorities say her alleged perpetrator is an undocumented migrant who was previously arrested for a non-violent crime but released by the New York Police Department.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act would require federal officials to apprehend and detain undocumented immigrants who commit crimes such as burglary, shoplifting or larceny until these individuals are removed from the United States.\n\nThe bill cleared the House in early March with support of every Republican and 37 Democrats.\n\nBut it hasn't gotten as robust support from Democrats in the upper chamber.\n\nTester will become the first Senate Democratic co-sponsor of the legislation, joining a slate of GOP co-sponsors. The move comes as the Montana Democrat, who faces a tough reelection this November, looks to further establish himself as a border security hard-liner.\n\n\"Keeping Montana safe is my top priority, which is why I've repeatedly called on the Biden Administration and Congress to do more to secure the southern border and have worked to get the brave men and women in law enforcement what they need to keep criminals off our streets,\" Tester said in a statement. \"After hearing from law enforcement officers across Montana, I'm backing the Laken Riley Act to make sure that individuals who enter our country and commit a crime are held accountable so that no Montana family has to worry about the safety of their loved ones.\"\n\nTester faces reelection in his deep-red state, where likely Republican Senate nominee Tim Sheehy is working to make high numbers of unauthorized border crossings and the spread of fentanyl top issues for his campaign.\n\nIn recent months, Tester has become more and more outspoken about the challenges at the southern border.\n\nTester was closely watched during an effort by House Republicans to convict Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas during a quickly-dispensed-with impeachment trial.\n\nThough Tester did ultimately vote with his party to prevent a trial, he called the situation at the southern border \"completely unacceptable\" and said that the Biden administration needed to \"do more\" to keep the county safe.\n\nThough there was an effort earlier this year to advance the bipartisan border security bill drafted by Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Ct., Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and James Lankford, R-Okla., those efforts ultimately stalled out after Senate Republicans rejected the deal because they felt it was not strong enough.\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Murphy, said yesterday they hope to reopen discussion about the border security provisions, just as sources tell ABC News that DHS is slated to propose a change to the process for those seeking asylum.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

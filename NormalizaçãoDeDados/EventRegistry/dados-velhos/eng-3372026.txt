Gore moved from Pune to Gorakhpur in 2008-two years after the government launched the first immunisation drive to vaccinate children up to 15 in Uttar Pradesh's (UP's) JE endemic areas-to set up NIV's Gorakhpur unit, which is in the BRD Medical College campus.\n\nAn incurable disease whose symptoms must be managed with medical attention until the patient, if strong enough, overcomes the infection, JE is not new to eastern UP, and the NIV unit was set up after the mosquito-borne virus swept through the area, between July and November 2005, infecting 5,737 people and claiming 1,334 lives. It was the longest and most severe JE epidemic UP had seen since the disease first surfaced 40 years ago in 1977.\n\nWhat makes Gorakhpur particularly vulnerable to JE is its abundance of rice fields in a bowl-shaped landscape that allows rainwater to collect in pools, creating ideal breeding conditions for the JE carrier, the Culex mosquito, which acquires the virus from feeding on infected domestic pigs, the amplifying host, and migratory birds, the natural host. High temperature and relative humidity during the monsoons make the transmission of the virus from the mosquito to humans easier.\n\n\"Immunisation is the only way to control JE encephalitis in highly endemic areas like Gorakhpur, and (it) has shown to be effective in reducing JE cases,\" Gore told IndiaSpend.\n\nThe government has made immunisation against JE part of routine immunisation in 198 endemic Indian districts.\n\nHowever, immunisation has not reached all of Gorakhpur's needy children.\n\nIn a 2015 survey, only 42.3% of Gorakhpur division's eligible children had had the two recommended doses of JE vaccination, according to an Indian Journal of Medical Research paper published in January 2017, co-authored by Gore. Poorly informed health workers, who believed the JE vaccination could not be simultaneously administered with the measles and DPT (diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus) vaccinations prescribed in India's Universal Immunisation Programme, were the main reason for the poor vaccination record. The health workers believed that simultaneously administering multiple vaccinations could overload children's immune system and increase the risk of side effects, so they asked mothers (or fathers) to return for the JE vaccination. The low coverage suggests that many parents who lived a \"hand-to-mouth\" existence, as Gore put it, did not return.\n\nAnother challenge is that the JE vaccination cannot prevent children from getting acute encephalitis, brain fever caused by other reasons than the Culex mosquito, which this news report suggests killed at least five of the children who died at the BRD Medical College.\n\nIndiaSpend talked to Gore for a firsthand account of the challenges facing the JE immunisation programme, halting the spread of JE in Gorakhpur and ensuring that JE patients are medically cared for.\n\nIn 2015, three in four children aged 25-36 months in Gorakhpur division had received at least one dose of JE vaccine, according to your co-authored paper published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in January 2017. Less than half (42.3%) the children aged 25-36 months had had two doses. And one in three of the eligible children missed the JE vaccine altogether. What challenges do immunisation health workers face? Why do so many children miss out on immunisation?\n\nIn a part of India where people lead a hand-to-mouth existence, women would rather go to work and earn a day's wage than take time off to take their child to the nearest primary health centre for immunisation. A door-to-door immunisation campaign would be more effective. It also does not help that rural women do not understand the importance of the immunisation card they are given. Cards frequently get misplaced. So it becomes hard to determine if a child has had one or two shots of a certain vaccine or none at all.\n\nRumour-mongering, which is easy where people are illiterate, can hamper immunisation efforts. When the first immunisation drive for children started back in 2006, a rumour that the vaccine can cause disease and was no good kept a lot of people away. Convincing parents about the benefits of immunisation is hard work. Drives rarely take place during an epidemic, they happen when calm prevails. Human memory tends to be short-lived; when the health worker presses parents to get their child immunised they say 'Everything is okay, what is the need for immunisation?'\n\nSometimes, the media do not realise how hard it is to bring about change at the grassroots level in India. Once, we achieved 80% coverage in an immunisation drive-which is good. But when word got out that we were planning to go back to the area to cover those children who had missed their shots, it was reported on the lines of, 'Immunisation drive misses out 20% children'. This is disheartening for ground workers.\n\nHow would you rate the BRD Medical College as a tertiary care centre? Is it capable of handling the sort of serious cases and the patient load that comes to it?\n\nI was recently taken by surprise to hear the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath say that BRD Medical College is a referral centre for five crore (50 million) people. I had never realised it serves so many. Now that I think about it, the actual number of people that seek its services is probably around six crore (60 million), if you also consider the population of the three neighbouring districts of Bihar for whom this hospital is closer than the nearest tertiary care centre in their own state. The hospital is mediocre as a health facility. Speaking with relevance to this incident, I am sure it is not the only government health centre in India where a chalta hai (make do) attitude has worsened the quality of patient care it is capable of and caused a tragedy.\n\nHow long can a patient of JE or AES in respiratory distress survive without oxygen?\n\nAt the most, 15 to 20 minutes. The failure of oxygen supply played a role in causing the 63 deaths (the death toll when this interview was conducted) of children in Gorakhpur. This fact is now out in the public domain.\n\nUP chief minister Yogi Adityanath's spontaneous response to the Gorakhpur JE crisis was to say that \"lives of young children have been snuffed out because we do not lead a clean and hygienic life\". Although the immediate cause of death of those 63 children in Gorakhpur was most likely the failure of oxygen supply, it is true that sanitation and hygiene play a big role in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as JE and dengue. Why have successive state governments not been able to improve conditions on the ground in Gorakhpur?\n\nJE persists in Gorakhpur for the same reason that India has not been able to root out dengue from Delhi, despite the fact that it is the national capital and, therefore, one would assume, has greater resources at its disposal than eastern UP. It takes sustained efforts to effect change on the ground. Sporadic cleanliness campaigns will not work. Effort must also be made to make the messaging effective. I recollect, when we were training health workers to impart hygiene information to the rural population, at one point, we realised how futile it was to conduct the training in Hindi. The local people speak Purvi. So we got the health workers to learn their lines in Purvi. Then, we realised that people were sure to have questions, so we brainstormed and asked the health workers what people's reservations might be and prepared responses in Purvi. We actually role-played the situation in Purvi. Using videos in the local language to spread awareness would be more effective. So would awareness campaigns targeting school-going children, college-going young adults and literate adults. Unless we each teach one (or more) people, change will elude India.\n\nWhy isn't JE being treated or at least partially managed at the primary health centres (PHCs)?\n\nJE is a viral disease, which means unlike a bacterial disease that requires the prescription of an antibiotic, it is treated symptomatically. A big challenge to the management of the disease at the PHC level is the general perception in rural people's minds-and I have seen this not just in Gorakhpur-is that PHCs are no good. When a family member falls sick, they prefer to wait it out, hoping for improvement. If the condition turns serious they rush to the shehar (city). It is also a fact that JE patients can be challenging to manage. Imagine a child suffering from seizures, frothing at the mouth, with or without respiratory distress. It is safe to say that most PHC workers are insufficiently trained to manage these symptoms, especially when they occur simultaneously. Also, PHCs are not equipped with respiratory support machines.\n\nSo families end up taking their loved ones to a nearby city or referral centre, in this case the BRD Medical College. Very often, the patient's condition worsens while being transferred because no one knows how to handle him or her. For instance, patients tend to be transferred in the supine (lying face upwards) position, which for a JE patient, can cause the accumulated froth to flow back down into the lungs, exacerbating the respiratory distress and even causing secondary infection. People may not know that they must place a soft cloth between the teeth of a JE patient suffering seizures to prevent self-harm. During my time in Gorakhpur, once, we developed pictorial pamphlets for distribution to create awareness of handling and transferring JE patients. Awareness drives must be ongoing or at least where JE is concerned, stepped up prior to the monsoon season.\n\nWhat protection, if any, does the body's immunity offer against JE? Could low immunity have played a role in the children contracting JE in the first place?\n\nOnly one in 500 people infected with JE actually presents clinical symptoms. The rest are strong enough to withstand the virus. This is true of dengue as well. Dengue is endemic to areas like Delhi and Lucknow but not to other parts of UP. During my years in Gorakhpur, I heard of instances of children of well-to-do families in UP being sent to study in Delhi in June, and falling prey to dengue in July/August. Their lack of exposure to dengue increased their susceptibility to contract the virus. Because poor hygiene and sanitation is a major problem across India, not just eastern UP, we immunologists commonly say that if a person has made it to age five (or so) in India, he or she has a significant immunity level. All the 63 victims of JE in this incident in Gorakhpur were children. I do not know their exact ages but I am pretty certain their age and overall health status was not on their side. Malnourishment lowers immunity.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100, "id": 1, "label": "dmoz/Health"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "wgt": 100,

The research centre is yet to see the light of the day.\n\nWhen the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was voted to power in 2007, the then chief minister Mayawati announced the BRD Medical College would be upgraded to a centre of excellence for treatment of encephalitis patients. But the project failed to take off.\n\nThe then union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad visited Gorakhpur in 2011 and announced establishment of a super-specialty hospital, rehabilitation centre and para medical staff training centre in the district. The project remained limited to paper.\n\nAfter the SP formed the government in 2012, the then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav visited Gorakhpur in October and announced establishment of a 500-bed hospital for the encephalitis patients. Though five years have gone by, construction of the hospital is yet to be completed.\n\nDr KP Kushwaha, former principal of BRD Medical College, told HT,\"In 1978, a report by the Indian Council for Medical Research said the mysterious virus that was killing children in Gorakhpur and its adjoining districts was Japanese Encephalitis (JE). But it took the central and state governments over two decades to realise that hundreds of children were dying due to lack of proper health facilities.\"\n\nIn 2004, the then chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav released Rs 93 lakh for establishment of oxygen pipeline in wards and purchase of ventilators at BRD Medical College. In 2005, the central government decided to launch a vaccination drive in districts infested with JE virus. But no concrete measures were taken to improve facilities for patients, he said.\n\nKushwaha said the Allahabad high court in 2006 directed the state government to increase the number of beds for encephalitis patients in wards, set up intensive care units, a rehabilitation centre and research centre.\n\nIn 2007, the state government set up two wards. In 2009 a unit of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune was set up in BRD Medical College to conduct research on patients.\n\nIn 2011, the high court again directed the state government to set up an expert committee and improve facilities for encephalitis patients. The state government released Rs 11 crore for upgradation of 100 bed encephalitis wards, he said.\n\nKushwaha called for establishment of a separate authority for the treatment of the encephalitis as was the case in Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore that have successfully controlled the outbreak of the disease.\n\nRather than working in an ad-hoc manner, the state government should set up sustainable infrastructure for the working of the authority, he said.\n\nSUGGESTIONS IGNORED\n\nA fact-finding team of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) visited the districts of east Uttar Pradesh in November 2011 to find out what measures had been taken by the state government to protect children from JE and AES. The NCPCR expressed dissatisfaction over action taken by the state government to deal with and prevent the JE/AES cases. It had directed the state government to prepare a long-term plan to protect the vulnerable children and take appropriate measures to curb the disease.\n\nIn 2015, experts of the US- based Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) visited Gorakhpur and expressed concern over continuing deaths due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in east UP and failure of the health department to identify the reasons for the illness.\n\nIn its report submitted to the health department, the CDC observed that despite its efforts, the department failed to put a stop to the deaths.\n\nThe members of CDC observed that BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur was overburdened with a continuous flow of patients. To check the rush, the CDC urged the health department to classify patients according to the severity of illness and send them to OPD, general ward, AES ward and ICU accordingly.\n\nExpressing concern over understaffing in BRD Medical College, the CDC recommended planned deputation of medical and nursing staff. The ancillary staff should be trained to perform dedicated respiratory care to support ventilator management, it said. The CDC suggested greater involvement of adult neurology and intensive care specialists of the BRD Medical College in management of patients.\n\nThe recommendations of NCPCR and the CDC are yet to be implemented.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100, "id": 1, "label": "dmoz/Health"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 100, "id": 2, "label":

The first, obviously, is the acute face of the tragedy: the shortage of oxygen supply in the critical care unit of a tertiary care public hospital. The second is the failure of India's public health system, which has allowed \"encephalitis\" to become an annual outbreak in the region.\n\nLet us begin with the latter.\n\n'Encephalitis' is a misnomer. The correct expression is Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) -- an umbrella term for diseases with certain characteristic symptoms. So when you hear \"encephalitis\" in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar mentioned in the same breath, be cautious. They are very different diseases, apart from their presentations.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, this generalisation could have had disastrous public health consequences. For long, annual \"encephalitis\" outbreaks in the adjoining districts of Gorakhpur and Kushinagar were thought to be rooted in Japanese Encephalitis (JE). JE is caused by a virus that is found in pigs, water birds and livestock, and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. UP has introduced JE vaccination in its routine immunisation schedule, and has organised, for several years now, special vaccination drives before summer. In 2013, when this writer was reporting the outbreak for The Indian Express, the administration in Gorakhpur boasted of over 90% vaccine coverage. But somewhere around mid-August, these were the numbers: a total 226 admissions and 59 deaths in Gorakhpur, and 248 cases and 43 deaths in Kushinagar. Of these, five patients in Gorakhpur and eight in Kushinagar had tested positive for JE.\n\nIn 2012, however, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) identified 100 isolates of organisms called enteroviruses (EV) -- specifically the human EV 89 and EV 76 types -- from 1,000 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from children admitted to Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital. As scientists told this writer then, 10% positivity is considered a great testing success in CSF samples. These enteroviruses spread through contaminated water, and trigger symptoms very similar to JE. And they are, of course, included under the ambit of the generalised, convenient term, 'AES'. Thus, in Gorakhpur, most children did not get sick after being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the virus; they merely had very bad quality water.\n\nIn Bihar the same year, scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other experts argued for classifying \"encephalitis\" outbreaks as Acute Neurological Syndrome (ANS) after carrying out their first investigation in Muzaffarpur district. They published the results of their investigation in The Lancet this year, identifying a toxicological root in the litchis grown in the district.\n\n***\n\nClearly, epidemiological investigation, a key discipline in public health, and central to understanding the root of \"mystery\" diseases, has been chaotic in both UP and Bihar for almost a decade. The system has been reactive -- busy treating symptoms rather than getting decisive, coordinated answers for, and targeting the roots of, disease.\n\nIn 1981, epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose described a phenomenon called the 'Prevention Paradox' -- the public health dogma that preventive interventions that benefit entire populations have very little or no tangible impact on individual health. Thus, they are not appreciated enough, even though they save the public health system a lot of money.\n\nVaccination is perhaps a more individual approach to public health. Every child is vaccinated, and there is the psychological impact of benefitting from an intervention. Obviously, when the target is a vaccine-preventable disease like polio or even JE, vaccines work wonders, and their importance cannot be overemphasised in population health. However, in this case in UP and Bihar, should JE vaccination have been made the only poster public health intervention? In Gorakhpur, NIV scientists have been pointing to enteroviruses since 2005-06. But neither the UPA's erstwhile Total Sanitation Campaign nor the present government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan targeted this actively.\n\n***\n\nNow consider the acute events that led to the present crisis. It is a blot on India's public health system that handheld \"ambu-bags\" are a characteristic feature of government hospital emergencies -- not just in \"interior\" districts like Gorakhpur, but also in Delhi and Mumbai. This is a commentary on how lost we are in health financing, payment and delivery mechanisms, despite many continuing policy experiments.\n\nSo, after all the PPPs, performance-based incentives, RFPs and RFQ models, and the debates around universal healthcare, social insurance, single- and multi-payer payment systems, it is a travesty that not only was the one tertiary health facility in a 300-km radius dependent on a contract and a subcontract for the supply of oxygen in its ICU, dues of less than $ 10,000 were delayed so long -- and that finally, despite being cleared by the state Health Department, payment to the supplier was held up in administrative bottlenecks.\n\nBut then again, this is no surprise. One of the images that stands out for this writer from her reporting in 2013 is that of the new 100-bed AES ward in BRD College, with 25 new ventilators purchased that year, but lying unused despite the growing number of patients, because the installation of oxygen pipelines had missed deadlines.\n\nThere is a slide that Harvard health economist Peter Berman always uses in his classes. It is from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland:\n\n\"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\"\n\n\"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\" said the Cat.\n\n\"I don't much care where...,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Then it doesn't matter which way you go,\" said the Cat.\n\n\"...so long as I get Somewhere,\" Alice added as an explanation.\n\nHealth systems scholars, funding agencies and policy thinktanks like the World Bank, IMF, and Oxfam have many disagreements. But the one thing that most agree on is the need for evidence-based action, as opposed to running in the dark, in search of Alice's \"somewhere\".\n\nFor every public health problem, this entails determining a goal, identifying an intervention that can help achieve that goal, ensuring a monitoring system to check for problems and course correction along the way and, finally at its conclusion, having a system for evaluating what the programme achieved, and where it failed. Introducing these seemingly logical steps for health policy decisions remains a challenge in India.\n\nExperts like the Harvard economist William Hsiao have long argued for identifying \"control knobs\" to overhaul health systems at the roots, against knee-jerk approaches to policy conundrums. Many of these classic control knobs can be traced to the present escalation: \"financing, payment, regulation, organisation\". These could be the routes towards targeted policy solutions to course-correct.\n\nIt must be pointed out here that UP, or even India, is no exception. Countries with higher income levels and with far bigger health budgets, too, are struggling to identify the right models for financing and delivering public health. Among OECD countries, the United States is a classic example of poor health outcomes despite gross overspending on health. It is now well established that while health budgets are critical, spending money alone is not enough. This is, of course, not to undermine the problems resulting from sectors like health and education historically getting the short end of the stick in India.\n\nThere is increasing realisation, however, that public health delivery is a complex story, entrenched in cultures of governance, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms on the one hand, and social structures, gender roles, income levels and inequalities on the other. The latter are classified under the \"social determinants\" of health. And as Gorakhpur has shown, it is always the poorest who face the brunt of poor health policies, management and financing.\n\npritha.chatterjee@mail.harvard.edu (Pritha Chatterjee, formerly with The Indian Express, is Research Fellow at the Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health.

The victims included neonates, or infants less than four weeks old.\n\n\"Newborns cannot catch the JE virus since they are born with immunity against such diseases for at least three months,\" said professor UK Mishra of Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) in Lucknow.\n\nMishra has done extensive research on the disease and published 25 research papers.\n\nAlso, he has recommended measures to control Japanese encephalitis and dengue to the Council of Science and Technology and the state government.\n\n\"It's wrong to say JE caused the deaths of neonates in Gorakhpur as they cannot catch the disease. They may be suffering from neonatal sepsis or septicemia,\" said the doctor, who visited Gorakhpur between 2010 and 2016 and suggested ways to prevent deaths.\n\nVK Paul, the head of paediatrics in New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), offered a similar opinion.\n\n\"It's true that babies have antibodies against many illnesses that the mother has experienced. So, if the mother has experienced JE, the child will not get it for about three to six months,\" he said.\n\nJapanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) became national buzzwords after 30 children died between August 9 and 11 in Gorakhpur's largest government hospital amid allegations that a private company contracted to supply oxygen cylinders cut supply over a payment dispute.\n\nThe state's BJP government admitted the shortage but dismissed allegations that an interruption in oxygen supplementation, which is crucial for critical care patients, caused the deaths.\n\nIt said the vector-borne disease and other complications were responsible. However, opposition parties blamed government apathy for the tragedy.\n\nAccording to hospital records, 49 neonates died between August 9 and 16. If professor Mishra is right, Japanese encephalitis cannot be the cause.\n\nFormer principal of BRD Medical College, RP Kushwaha, seconded Mishra's comments.\n\n\"Neonates cannot suffer from JE as they are immune to it. So anyone saying neonates died due to JE is wrong. Newborns can die because of encephalopathy, which is caused by asphyxia and neonatal sepsis or septicaemia,\" he said.\n\nLike much of eastern UP, Gorakhpur is a Japanese-encephalitis-prone area and chief minister Yogi Adityanath wants a research centre in the area.\n\nBut experts believe previous studies were good enough to reduce the number of deaths.\n\nA Centre of Excellence in Encephalitis Research was opened in Lucknow's SGPGIMS in 2010 for research and training in clinically relevant areas of the disease, Mishra said. The state's Council of Science and Technology supported the endeavour.\n\n\"I visited encephalitis-endemic areas of Gorakhpur almost every year and brought out research papers with my team.\"\n\nThe centre trained around 100 paediatricians and doctors in diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe experts proposed low-cost intensive care units for encephalitis treatment. The technique was adopted by tropical countries such as Vietnam, which has controlled the disease significantly.\n\nBut in 2016, the science council withdrew its aid for research and no SGPGIMS expert went to Gorakhpur for field study since then.\n\nThe experts advised that the government should implement their recommendations, instead of setting up local research centres.", "date": "2017-08-18",

Immunization coverage in the state is anyway very low but some areas in Gorakhpur are in really bad situation,\" Haldar added.\n\nOver the past week, around 85 children have died in Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College Hospital in one of the worst public health crisis the state has seen.\n\nAccording to the health ministry, Uttar Pradesh accounts for over 50% of the total deaths of children in India.\n\nAccording to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 (2015-16), only 51% children (12-23 months) in Uttar Pradesh get the BCG vaccine (for tuberculosis), measles, polio (3 doses) and DPT (diphtheria, pertussis or whooping cough and tetanus). Only 52% get vaccinated for Hepatitis B.\n\nThe state government attributes many of the deaths of children at BRD Medical College to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). According to the Union health ministry, the disease is endemic in the area and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been running a prevention programme in the state since 2005. Two doses of JE (Japanese Encephalitis) vaccine (first during 9-12 months and second during 16-24 months of age) are administered under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP).\n\nICMR recently conducted surveys to estimate the coverage of the JE vaccine in Gorakhpur. A total of 840 children were surveyed, 210 from each district.\n\n\"The proportion of children receiving the second dose was low, with about 60% not receiving it. Nearly half of eligible children missed either the JE-1 or JE-2 vaccine during 2012-2013,\" said Soumya Swaminathan, secretary, department of health research, Union health ministry and director

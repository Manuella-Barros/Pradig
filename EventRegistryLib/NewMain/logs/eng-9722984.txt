The seized pills had a street value of approximately $537,660.\n\nThe investigation revealed that Mack distributed nearly 1 million fentanyl pills in Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin. In addition to sending them via UPS, he paid couriers to conceal fentanyl pills in carry-on luggage and transport them on commercial flights.\n\nDuring an interview, Mack took credit for most of the fentanyl pills in the Fox Valley, stating, \"There's not a single pill in the Valley that doesn't have my name on it.\"\n\nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), counterfeit Percocet\u00ae pills are commonly made by Mexican drug cartels and smuggled into the United States.

Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, has become a leading cause of overdose deaths across the country.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are seizing massive quantities of this deadly substance, with recent seizures alone containing enough fentanyl to kill the combined populations of California, Texas, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe alarming increase in fentanyl trafficking and consumption highlights the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to combat this epidemic and protect communities nationwide. (Related: In just one month, U.S. authorities confiscate enough fentanyl to kill combined populations of California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.)\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized over 80 million fake pills laced with fentanyl and nearly 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. This surpassed 2022's total of 58 million pills. These seizures amounted to more than 381 million lethal doses.\n\nSo far this year, the DEA has already seized nearly 28 million fentanyl pills and over 4,000 pounds of fentanyl powder, amounting to nearly 200 million deadly doses of fentanyl. Here are three states where the most fentanyl has been seized.\n\nFollowing a major bust, the DEA expects Utah to set a record for the number of fentanyl pills seized this year. As reported by Kyle Dunphey for Utah News Dispatch on July 4, the DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division seized around 170,000 fentanyl pills in Utah within two weeks in June. This is about a quarter of the total pills seized in 2023, which was a record-breaking 664,000 pills.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

According to Jonathan Pullen, the special agent in charge of the division, these seizures indicate the presence of Mexican criminal groups operating in Utah.\n\n\"The drug cartels in Mexico are not slowing down their production and distribution of this deadly poison. Fentanyl pills and powder are widespread, and the cartels targeting Utah do not care if you are on summer vacation. We urge you to discuss the dangers of fentanyl with your family, friends and community,\" Pullen said.\n\nThe investigations into these seizures are ongoing and further details are not currently available. However, a warrant filed in Utah's Fourth District Court in March mentioned an unnamed drug trafficking group from Sinaloa, Mexico, under investigation since 2016 for its operations in Utah. This investigation has led to the arrest of dozens of group members and the seizure of hundreds of pounds of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and over $2 million in cash and assets.\n\nData from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control show that around 105,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, with about 70 percent of those deaths involving fentanyl, according to the DEA. \"The recent seizures of 170,000 fentanyl pills in Utah likely saved lives across the state,\" said Dustin Gillespie, the special agent in charge of the Salt Lake City DEA office.\n\nAs of June 27, nearly seven million fentanyl pills and 3,725 pounds of fentanyl powder have been seized in California since January 2024. This massive haul, reported by ABC7 in the Bay Area, includes drugs intercepted at the southern border by the California National Guard's Counterdrug Task Force. In May alone, the task force confiscated over one million fentanyl pills and nearly 1,000 pounds of fentanyl powder.\n\n\"The California National Guard's Counterdrug Task Force continues to play an important role in the fight against fentanyl. We are proud to support our local, state, federal, and tribal law enforcement partners with critical resources,\" said Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, the California National Guard's adjutant general.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has doubled the deployment of CalGuard service members to tackle fentanyl smuggling. The state also launched opioids.ca.gov for opioid prevention and treatment information and to highlight efforts to hold pharmacies and drug traffickers accountable.\n\nAs part of the fight against the fentanyl crisis, over-the-counter naloxone, branded as CalRx, is becoming available across California. Newsom's office stated that through the Naloxone Distribution Project, CalRx naloxone nasal spray will be provided for free to eligible organizations or sold for $24 per twin-pack through Amneal.\n\nOn May 20, Lindsey Toomer of Colorado Newsline reported that Colorado set a record for fentanyl pill seizures in 2023 and 2024 is already on track to surpass that. According to a new report from New York University's Langone Health, Colorado and New Mexico tied for the second-highest number of fentanyl pill seizures in the U.S. in 2023, with 1,353 each. This led to 5.1 million pills being confiscated across Colorado.\n\nMost of the fentanyl seized in Colorado in 2023 was in pill form. The DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division seized a record 2.6 million pills in Colorado alone. This division saw a total of 3.4 million pills seized across all four states in 2023, highlighting Colorado's significant share. For comparison, the division seized 565,200 pills in 2021 and 1.9 million pills in 2022.\n\n\"It's an alarming increase. In the first three months of 2024, we were almost at half of last year's total. Unfortunately, it looks like we'll break that record again,\" said David Olesky, the division's acting special agent in charge.\n\nOlesky noted that Colorado is seeing seizure numbers similar to those of border states in previous years. What used to be considered a large haul is now becoming more common. For instance, a single seizure in Trinidad earlier this year netted over 300,000 pills, pushing the state past last year's halfway mark of 1.3 million pills by March.\n\nOregon officials declare state

The Drug Enforcement Administration says 7 out of every 10 of these pills tested contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl. In 2023, the DEA seized 79.5 million fentanyl pills.\n\nIn December 2022, investigators intercepted a postal delivery from Arizona containing more than 53,000 fentanyl pills with an estimated street value of $537,660, according to a criminal complaint. A DEA Task Force officer posed as a UPS delivery driver and delivered the package at an address in Appleton to Mack, who was then arrested.\n\nMack told investigators he obtained the fentanyl-laced pills in Arizona and mailed them to Appleton, where he intended to distribute them.\n\nInvestigators say Mack distributed nearly a million fentanyl-laced pills in Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona. The counterfeit Percocet pills were sent through the mail, as well as concealed in carry-on luggage in flights, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n\nInvestigators had been monitoring Mack prior to his arrest. In May 2022, the Lake Winnebago Area Metropolitan Enforcement Group -- a multi-jurisdictional drug unit made up of investigators from police departments and sheriffs' offices in Outagamie, Winnebago and Calumet counties -- installed a GPS tracking device on Mack's vehicle. Investigators found no evidence of drug trafficking from that tracking device.\n\nA year later, an Outagamie County assistant district attorney discovered the paperwork getting permission for investigators to put a tracking device on Mack's vehicle was forged. Former Appleton Police Department narcotics investigator Jeremey Haney was convicted in Outagamie County Circuit Court of misconduct in public office for falsifying information in a report.\n\nThe case was investigated by the Lake Winnebago Area Metropolitan Enforcement Group and the DEA.\n\nRELATED: Appleton investigator faces forgery charges tied to 'large-scale' drug case, says he lost

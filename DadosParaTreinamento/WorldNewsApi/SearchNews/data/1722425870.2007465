{"id": 243236346, "title": "PHSAI Pushes For Prioritisation Of Women's Healthcare Needs In Lagos Budget", "text": "Inaugurates 20 Health Champions In response to identified gaps in women\u2019s healthcare, the Public Health Sustainable Advocacy Initiative (PHSAI) with support from Pathfinder International has urged the Lagos State Ministry of Health to prioritise its budget and funding allocations to meet their needs. A recent in-depth research report has uncovered significant deficiencies in accessibility and funding for women\u2019s healthcare in Lagos State. In response to these findings, PHSAI in collaboration with Pathfinder International has taken proactive measures to address these gaps. Consequently, it has launched a ground-breaking initiative by inaugurating 20 Inclusive Women\u2019s Health Champions at a capacity-building workshop weekend, in Lagos. These champions are committed to improving women\u2019s health services in Lagos State and closing the existing disparities. Of the five percent of the total Lagos State 2024 healthcare budget put at N114.378 billion, only N227,103,500 is allocated to family planning and reproductive health. Abiodun Ajayi, the Executive Director of PHSAI, stressed the importance of prioritising women\u2019s health, emphasising that \u201cPreserving women\u2019s lives is vital for securing the well-being of future generations. We must amplify the voices of women and allocate adequate funding towards projects that support women.\u201d This initiative aims to bring about tangible enhancements in women\u2019s healthcare services and advocate for increased governmental support to effectively address the identified gaps. Abiodun said, \u201cSaving the lives of women is essential for safeguarding the well-being of future generations. We must amplify women\u2019s voices and allocate sufficient funding towards projects that benefit women.\u201d The initiative aims to bring about tangible improvements in women\u2019s healthcare services and advocate for increased governmental funding to successfully address identified gaps. Barr. Ayo Adebusoye, Chairman of PHSAI, expressed concern over the urgency of the situation, citing the alarming maternal mortality rate in Nigeria, with 512 deaths for every 100,000 births. He enjoined the champions to work towards reducing maternal deaths in Lagos by 20 percent before 2030. \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon, but every life saved is a job well done,\u201d Adebusoye noted. Also, Dr. Funmi Ige, President of the Medical Women Association of Nigeria, emphasised the importance of prioritising women\u2019s health, stating, \u201cWhen you take care of a woman and a child, you have taken care of the family, and ultimately, the nation.\u201d Earlier, in her remarks, Ms. Margaret Chichi Nkire, State Programme Coordinator of Pathfinder Lagos, said that the goal of the project under the New Venture Fund Project aims to achieve better maternal and newborn health policy and funding for the health of women in Lagos State and Kano State in Nigeria and will run from January to December 2024. \u201cOur mission is to strengthen multi-level partnerships for advocacy for women\u2019s health in Nigeria from January to December 2024 especially in Lagos and Kano States where PHSAI will be supporting our advocacy drive and Centre for Communication and Social Impact will be providing technical support for the project,\u201d Nkire stressed. The Lagos State Ministry of Health has endorsed the initiative which is focused on enhancing women\u2019s health within the State. With the inauguration of the Inclusive Women\u2019s Health Champions, PHSAI is positioned to create a substantial positive influence on the lives of women in Lagos State. \u201cTogether, we can achieve a better and sustainable health facility that will be enviable across the federation,\u201d Ajayi noted.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-scaled.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /></div>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inaugurates 20 Health Champions In response to identified gaps in women&#8217;s healthcare, the Public Health Sustainable Advocacy Initiative (PHSAI) with support from Pathfinder International has urged the Lagos State Ministry of Health to prioritise its budget and funding allocations to meet the", "url": "https://independent.ng/phsai-pushes-for-prioritisation-of-womens-healthcare-needs-in-lagos-budget/", "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/PHSAI-1-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:47:58", "author": "Chioma Umeha", "authors": ["Chioma Umeha"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.49}

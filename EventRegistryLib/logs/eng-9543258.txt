But it has not yielded any agreement on the key issues that divide them and drive tensions in their intense strategic competition -- Taiwan, war in Ukraine, trade, technology curbs and military postures, especially in the South China Sea.\n\nThe visit of the US secretary of state to Beijing in late April was part of the effort to improve communication and contain tensions between the two countries. Antony Blinken's trip took place against a mixed background of escalating tensions but also modest advances in cooperation and communication in certain areas. This resulted from the meeting last November between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinpingon the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco. Their first face-to-face meeting in over a year produced a tentative thaw in frosty ties. It led to restoration of high-level military-to-military contacts, suspended by Beijing in 2020, and agreement on counter-narcotics cooperation. Last month, the two leaders also spoke on the phone. Increased dialogue was reflected in the conversation between the defence ministers and US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen's visit to China last month. The first talks on artificial intelligence between the two countries are due to take place in coming weeks.\n\nBut just hours before Blinken's arrival in Beijing, the US Congress approved billions of dollars of assistance for Taiwan and to counter China in the so-called Indo-Pacific region. This was part of a $61bn aid package that included funding for Ukraine and Israel. It also involved the requirement for TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell its stake in the social media platform or face a ban in America. In election year, US officials have threatened higher tariffs on Chinese imports, with Biden calling for tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium -- clearly as part of his re-election campaign.\n\nNot surprisingly, Blinken was told at the outset of his trip that the US had to choose between cooperation and confrontation. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during the talks that while dialogue and cooperation had increased in \"various fields\", \"negative factors\" in the relationship are \"still rising and accumulating\". He warned against any transgression of China's red lines. A Chinese foreign ministry statement said Wang also criticised Washington for taking \"an endless stream of measures to suppress China's economy, trade, science and technology\", aimed at containment of China. But he acknowledged \"the China-US relationship is beginning to stabilise\" and called for progress in areas where the two countries agreed. This was echoed by Blinken, who said the US \"seeks to deepen cooperation where our interests align\", while reaffirming US commitmentto \"maintaining and strengthening lines of communication to advance that agenda and deal responsibly with differences to avoid any miscalculations\".\n\nBoth the US and China want to avoid a collision course even as their strategic competition intensifies.\n\nThe high point of Blinken's visit was of course the meeting with President Xi. That the Chinese president received him indicated Beijing's desire to calm tensions with Washington. Warning against \"vicious competition\", President Xi told Blinken that the US and China should be partners and not rivals -- who \"help each other succeed and not harm each other\". China, he said, wants to see a \"confident, open and prosperous United States\" but expected the US to see China's development in a positive light. According to a statement issued by the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi also told Blinken that both sides \"should honour words with actions rather than say one thing and do another\". He called for \"mutual coexistence\" and emphasised the need to follow through on what was agreed between him and President Biden in San Francisco to improve bilateral relations.\n\nThe readout from the American side was that Blinken conveyed US concerns on a number of issues, especially China's military assistance to Russia in the Ukraine war. Speaking to the media before the meeting, he said Russia \"would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support\", pointing out that Beijing supplied machine tools and several dual-use items critical for Russia's defence industry. This posed a threat not just to Ukraine but also to Europe and was a red line for Washington. He said after the meeting the US will wait to see how China addresses this concern, warning that sanctions could be imposed if Beijing did not respond. This injected a jarring note into the otherwise positive atmospherics of Blinken's trip. The Chinese reaction was predictably sharp. A foreign ministry spokesman rejected \"groundless\" US accusations as an effort to shift blame, while Wang made it clear that \"China is neither the creator of the Ukraine crisis nor a party to it\". But days later, Washington went ahead and sanctioned several Chinese companies for supplying Russia with components for military use.\n\nNevertheless, Blinken's visit reflected an effort by both sides to stabilise the relationship and limit the turbulence and volatility that have come to characterise Sino-US ties. But beyond this effort to ease tensions, which is important, there was no evidence of any narrowing of differences between the two sides on core issues. Moreover, the run-up to the US presidential election in November is likely to see a significant amount of China-bashing, given the political consensus and popular sentiment in America that advocates a tougher posture towards Beijing. Both Biden and Donald Trump can be expected to vie with each other in striking a more aggressive stance on China.\n\nTaiwan will continue to be a dangerous flashpoint in the US-China confrontation, especially as the region surrounding it is bristling with heightened military activity. The military build-up and a series of recent incidents in the South China Sea also present obvious risks. The resumption of high-level military contacts between China and the US will be important to enable the two countries to reduce the risk of any inadvertent or accidental conflict.\n\nEven if the recent US-China diplomatic engagement has not produced any breakthroughs on contentious issues, it indicates that neither side wants unmanaged tensions to push the two countries onto a collision course, which would have unpredictable consequences for them as well as the rest of the world.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Wang remarked that even though the \"giant ship\" of China-U.S. ties had stabilized, negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building.\n\nAccording to Wang, the U.S. has been challenging China's core interests and suppressing the country's development. Despite this, Beijing is interested in \"stable, healthy and sustainable\" relations and \"win-win cooperation\" with Washington. But China's top diplomat also mentioned that bilateral ties face \"all kinds of disruptions\" - leading to his warning that Beijing and Washington could either engage in cooperation or confrontation, the latter if anything goes wrong.\n\nWhile Wang did not mention it outright, his remarks ostensibly pertained to tensions around the self-governing Taiwan - which the mainland considers as a province. Despite agreeing with the \"One China\" policy on paper, Washington maintains ties with Taipei and supplies it with weapons.\n\n\"Washington should not interfere in Chinese internal affairs or cross Beijing's 'red lines' when it comes to the nation's sovereignty, security and development,\" the Chinese foreign minister stressed.\n\nBlinken arrived at the Chinese capital from the eastern city of Shanghai on April 25, urging the Chinese government to provide a level playing field for American firms in the country.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

The secretary of state also told his Chinese counterpart that the Biden administration \"wants to ensure that we're as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations.\"\n\nOfficials from the U.S. Department of State indicated that China's alleged support for Russia amid the latter's conflict with Ukraine would top Blinken's agenda during his visit to Beijing. While China hasn't supplied any weapons to Russia, U.S. officials claim Chinese-made circuitry, aircraft parts and machine tools have been helping Moscow boost its military-industrial capacity.\n\nCiting alleged informed sources, the Wall Street Journal reported on April 26 that U.S. authorities are preparing sanctions that would target Chinese companies and cut off some of the country's banks from the global financial system.\n\nBlinken urged Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping to cut back on his nation's support for Russia's defense industry during a separate meeting on April 26, noting that \"Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support.\" The secretary of state also warned that Washington is prepared to act if Beijing didn't heed its concerns. (Related: Blinken meets with Xi in Beijing as China puts onus on US to stabilize deteriorating relations.)\n\nTies between the two nations have also been strained by China's claims over the South China Sea and U.S. export bans on advanced technology. They were further damaged by a row over a spy balloon last February. Then, just a few days ago, the U.S. passed a law that would force Chinese-owned TikTok to sell the hugely popular video app or be banned in America. Washington also approved its latest aid package early this week which included military assistance to Taiwan. This drew sharp criticism from Beijing.\n\nWatch China expert Gordon Chang explaining why U.S. President Joe Biden forging relations with China is the \"biggest diplomatic mistake\" he has committed

So into the Beijing/ Washington political turbulence Sec. Blinken flew, to smooth the Sino/American political rivalry, especially over China's military assertiveness towards the South China Sea, Taiwan, the Ukraine war and naturally two-way trade.\n\n\"It was clear coming in that the relationship was at a point of instability,\" Blinken told a press conference. \"And both sides recognized the need to work to stabilize it.\"\n\nAmong the key concerns, \"shared by a growing number of countries\" remains China's \"provocative actions to the Taiwan Strait, as well as in the South and East China Seas.\" Sec. Blinken stated, \"I discussed the PRC's dangerous actions in the South China Sea, including against routine Philippine maintenance operations... Freedom of navigation and commerce in these water-ways is not only critical to the Philippines, but to the U.S. and to every other nation in the Indo-Pacific and indeed around the world.\"\n\nSignificantly the Secretary reaffirmed the U.S.'s \"one China\" policy and stressed the critical importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\" He was referring to menacing flights of Chinese military aircraft which circle the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, as well as Beijing's baseless territorial claims to islands, shoals and waters in the South China Sea.\n\nOn the human rights front, Secretary Blinken \"raised concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic institution\" as well as \"ongoing human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet.\" Was it virtue signaling that the Secretary and his entourage visited a Tibetan restaurant while in the Chinese capital?\n\nCommercial ties between the U.S./PRC are huge but still massively favor China through longstanding trade deficits with the United States. While American exports to China have importantly increased, the trade imbalance last year still reached a whopping $279 billion. To narrow the deficit Blinken visited a famous Beijing store Li Pi Records; he purchased the recent Taylor Swift album \"Midnights\" which the Secretary called a successful American export!\n\nA point Blinken made to skeptical Chinese trade officials was to clarify the U.S. stance towards China, namely that the U.S. is not seeking to \"contain\" China economically. He added \"We are for de-risking and diversifying. That means investing in our own capacities and in secure, resilient supply chains.\"\n\nTurning to the war in Ukraine, Secretary Blinken warned his Chinese counterparts, over \"our serious concern about the PRC providing components that are powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine. China is the top supplier of machine tools, microelectronics, nitrocellulose, which is critical to making munitions and rocket propellants, and other dual-use items.\" Washington is watching carefully.\n\nLater discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi were described as \"candid, substantive and constructive,\" in other words not exactly warm and friendly. Wang Yi, warned the U.S. Secretary that the United States should respect China's \"red lines,\" namely the PRC's territorial claim over democratic Taiwan as well as \"introducing measures to contain China.\"\n\nThe Chinese communist leader Xi Jinping using the grandiose setting of Beijing's Great Hall of the People, acted as a latter-day Emperor in greeting Blinken advising his American visitor that China and the U.S. should be partners, not rivals with both countries seeking \"mutual success.\" Xi warned against \"vicious competition\" between Beijing and Washington over political flashpoints such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nRelated: Xi signals contempt, shows Blinken who is the new hegemon, April 30, 2024\n\nOne area of cooperation remains education but the balance tilts largely towards Chinese students coming to America. Blinken asserted, \"While there are more than 290,000 Chinese students in the United States, there are fewer than 900 Americans studying here in China, and that's a significant drop from a decade ago when we had about 15,000 Americans studying here.\" Naturally the COVID-19 pandemic emanating from the Chinese city of Wuhan, closed the country to foreign visitors and students.\n\nBut China has indeed focused on American education, setting up the dubious \"Confucius Institutes\" on many campuses and emerging as a major donor to U.S. Universities. According to a survey by the Wall Street Journal, China made $2.3 billion in contracts and grants to over 200 American Colleges between 2012 and 2024.\n\nThe rivalry between China and the United States is rooted in profoundly different political systems not to mention serious trade imbalances and enduring strategic competition in East Asia, and the developing world. It's all very complicated.", "source": {"uri": "worldtribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Tribune: Window on the Real World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Speaking at a news conference after a gathering of G7 foreign ministers on the Italian island of Capri, Blinken underscored Washington's firm stance against any assistance to Russia's war effort, cautioning that China cannot simultaneously seek positive relations with Europe while aiding Russia's aggression.\n\n\"We see China sharing machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defense industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade,\" Blinken elaborated. \"Now, if China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War.\"\n\nIn addition, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock echoed Blinken's concerns, emphasizing the incompatibility of China's partnership with Russia amid its illegal war against Ukraine. The gravity of the situation was further highlighted by U.S. officials who disclosed China's provision of materials, including drone and missile technology, aiding Russia's military buildup for its ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Despite assertions from a Chinese embassy spokesperson that normal trade should not be hindered, the issue has been raised at the highest levels of diplomacy, with President Joe Biden discussing it with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn February 2023, China proposed a \"peace plan\" to stop the war in Ukraine, which called for direct negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv, without any notion of Russia withdrawing its troops from occupied Ukrainian territory. In March 2024, Chinese diplomats reiterated Beijing's position, saying that the conflict would have to be resolved through negotiations that need to \"take Russian interests into account.\" Chinese firms are playing an increasingly key role in propping up Russia's struggling economy and boosting its military capabilities, including via the trade of goods for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, as reported by CNBC.\n\nPresident Joe Biden raised the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call earlier this month, marking their first conversation since an in-person meeting last November. Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday and raised concerns this week with Chinese officials over the country's support for Russia. Blinken's trip to China signifies a diplomatic effort to address these concerns directly, marking his second visit since a previous mission aimed at mitigating U.S.-China tensions. Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support,\" Blinken said at a press conference in Beijing Friday.\n\nBlinken's discussions with Chinese officials coincide with efforts by the U.S. and China to maintain communication channels amid ongoing tensions. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, exacerbated by external support, threatens to destabilize not only the region but also global peace and security. As diplomatic efforts intensify, the outcome of discussions between the U.S. and China holds significant implications for future geopolitical dynamics. It underscores the imperative for a concerted international effort to address conflicts and uphold principles of peace and stability on a global scale.", "source": {"uri": "theowp.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Organization for World Peace"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dual-use technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalena_Baerbock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annalena Baerbock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://theowp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/With_President_of_China_Xi_Jinping2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543258", "eventUri": "eng-9543258", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

out a clear vision for future relations\n\nAlthough both sides may wish to avoid outright conflict, there are profound differences and a lack of trust that will be very difficult to overcome\n\nTies between the United States and China are on a \u201clong trajectory of decline\u201d despite recent efforts to stabilise the relationship, according to diplomatic observers who point to the deep mistrust that remains between the two sides.\n\nWith some describing the situation as a \u201cnew cold war\u201d, there are growing calls within Washington for the US to formulate a clearer policy on

on China as it faces ever more cutting-edge defence technology, including hypersonic weapons, but Beijing could expect little in the way of substantive changes in power dynamics in the near term.\n\nOn Wednesday, as he met Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House, US President Joe Biden said Aukus was \u201cexploring\u201d ways to cooperate with Japan in hi-tech defence

\u2018Jaukus\u2019 bloc is unlikely\n\nStill, there are opportunities for Japan to cooperate with Australia, the UK and US on areas \u2018beyond the first pillar\u2019, including on AI and hypersonic

he stopped short of suggesting Japan should join a pact that presently brings together Australia, Britain and the United States.\n\nThe latest comments by Richard Marles could mark disappointment for Tokyo, given that Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso on a trip to Canberra last November had proposed that Japan be added to the grouping to form \u201cJaukus\u201d, and counter a \u201clong

\u201cwarning\u201d to Beijing against military advancement and a conflict across the Taiwan Strait, according to analysts.\n\nDuring a visit to South Korea on Saturday, General Charles Flynn, the US Army Pacific commander, said the army would soon deploy a new missile launch system that could fire its latest \u201clong-range precision fires\u201d, such as the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) interceptor

Rohingya [were targeted] in Burma, Uyghurs in Xinjiang -- each victims of genocide and crimes against humanity.\"\n\n\"The United States will continue to raise our deep concerns directly with the governments responsible,\" Blinken said.\n\nSince 2020, every annual State Department report on human rights in China has unambiguously stated that the communist regime running the country was committing genocide.\n\n\"The People's Republic of China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority,\" said the 2020 report.\n\n\"Genocide and crimes against humanity occurred during the year against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang,\" it said.\n\nThe first sentence of the 2023 report, which the State Department released April 22, declares: \"Genocide and crimes against humanity occurred during the year in China against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.\"\n\nThe second sentence cites many other human rights abuses this communist regime had perpetrated. These include \"arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government; enforced disappearances by the government; torture by the government\" and \"involuntary or coercive medical or psychological practices.\"\n\nThe State Department report also says the government of China was guilty of \"arbitrary interference with privacy including pervasive and intrusive technical surveillance and monitoring\" and \"serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, including criminal prosecution of journalists, lawyers, writers, bloggers, dissidents, petitioners, and others.\"\n\nThe new report also says this communist regime continued to carry out a coercive population-control policy.\n\n\"Enforcement of the decades-old population-control policy, which originally limited parents to one child, relied on social pressure, education, propaganda, and economic penalties, as well as on measures such as mandatory pregnancy examinations, forced contraception, forced sterilizations, and coerced abortions,\" says this new report.\n\nBlinken flew to the city of Shanghai, China, the day after holding his press conference, releasing the human rights report, and personally describing China's Uyghur population as \"victims of genocide and crimes against humanity.\"\n\nOver the course of three days, the secretary of state met with multiple leaders of China's communist regime. In public statements he made in China on April 24, 25, and 26, he never specifically cited the genocide he had noted April 22 in Washington.\n\nOn the night of April 24, after he arrived in Shanghai, Blinken attended the Chinese Basketball Association playoff game between the Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, according to the State Department.\n\nThe next morning, Blinken met with Shanghai Chinese Communist Party Secretary Chen Jining in Shanghai. Before going into this meeting, he and Chen made public statements. The Communist Party secretary took note of what Blinken had done the previous night.\n\n\"Last night I watched the news, and I saw that you went to our Yu Garden to enjoy our local delicacy, and you also watched our basketball match,\" Chen told Blinken, according to a transcript published by the State Department.\n\nIn his own remarks, Blinken talked about building \"cooperation\" with this communist government.\n\n\"I think the direction from President [Joe] Biden and President Xi [Jinping] was to continue to build those lines of communication, to sustain, and again, to deal directly with our differences as we also seek to build cooperation, Biden's secretary of state said.\n\nBlinken then met with business leaders in Shanghai, where he talked about Biden's meeting with Chinese Xi in California last November -- and about America's purchasing of Chinese imports.\n\n\"And one of the things that President Biden and President Xi agreed when they met in San Francisco was that we have to -- we need to find ways to put as much stability as possible into the relationships to make sure that we're managing the relationship responsibly, which we're committed to doing,\" Blinken said. \"And a big part of that is making sure that the economic relationship is working in ways that it should work to mutual benefit.\"\n\n\"We have, as you know, a relationship that has us as the largest market for products that are made in China. That remains the case,\" Blinken said.\n\nIn 2023, according to the Census Bureau, the United States purchased $427.22 billion in imports from China, while China purchased only $147.80 billion from the United States -- resulting in a trade deficit of $279.42 billion.\n\nBlinken met April 26 with Chinese Foreign Minster Wang Yi.\n\n\"Overall, the China-U.S. relationship is beginning to stabilize,\" Wang said before the two officials went into their meeting. \"Across the areas, our two sides have increased dialogue, cooperation, and the positive side of the relationship.\"\n\nBlinken then said Biden had given him a specific instruction for this trip to Beijing: \"to work on moving forward on the agreements that our two presidents reached in San Francisco at the end of last year: resuming cooperation on counternarcotics; restarting our military-to-military conversations; looking together at the future of artificial intelligence -- its risks and safety issues; and trying to strengthen our people-to-people connections; but also, critically, managing responsibly our differences.\"\n\nAfter meeting with Wang, Blinken met with Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong. Then he met with Xi himself.\n\n\"Now, even as we seek to deepen cooperation where our interests align, the United States is very clear-eyed about the challenges posed by the PRC [People's Republic of China] and about our competing visions for the future,\" Blinken said in a press conference after the meeting. \"America will always defend our core interests and values.\"\n\nThe U.S. secretary of state then did mention Xinjiang, citing what he called \"human rights abuses\" there, not genocide.\n\n\"I also raised concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic institutions as well as transnational repression, ongoing human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, and a number of individual human rights cases,\" Blinken said.\n\nBlinken should have unambiguously condemned Xi for the genocide his communist regime has perpetrated.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS.COM", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Nye, Jr.", "body": "Even though the United States has abandoned its policy of engagement with China, the strategy of great power competition that replaced it does not prevent cooperation in certain areas. A good analogy is a football match, where two teams compete fiercely but respect certain rules and boundaries, only kicking the ball rather than each other.\n\nCAMBRIDGE When US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently visited Beijing in an effort to stabilize relations with China, many of the issues discussed with Chinese President Xi Jinping were highly contentious. For example, Blinken has warned China against providing materials and technology to help Russia in its war against Ukraine, and he has opposed China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and the harassment of the Philippines (a US ally). Other disputes involved the interpretation of the U.S. One-China policy toward Taiwan and U.S. trade and export controls on the flow of technology to China.\n\nIndia's despotic elections have angered people/Getty Images Navigating major transitions in an uncertain economy Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images What to look for in Trump's first trial Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nI was visiting Beijing around the same time as chairing a second-track Sino-US dialogue, where citizens in communication with their respective governments can meet and speak for themselves. Because these discussions are off the record and refutable, they can sometimes be more frank. That was certainly the case this time, when a delegation from the Aspen Strategy Group met with a group convened by the influential Central Party School in Beijing, the sixth such meeting between the two institutions in the past decade .\n\nPredictably, the Americans reinforced Blinken's message on controversial issues, and the Chinese reiterated their own government's positions. As a retired Chinese general warned, Taiwan is at the heart of our major concerns.\n\nThings got more interesting, however, when the group turned to exploring possible areas of cooperation. The change in American policy, moving from a commitment to China to a strategy of competition between great powers, does not exclude cooperation in certain areas. To frame the discussion, we used the analogy of a football match: two teams compete fiercely, but they kick the ball rather than the other players, and everyone is supposed to stay within the white lines.\n\nChanging the metaphor, some Chinese feared that the American emphasis on establishing guardrails was akin to putting seat belts in a car, which encouraged speeding; but most agreed that the main goal was to avoid a crash. To this end, we have identified seven areas of potential cooperation.\n\nThe first and most obvious is climate change, which threatens both countries. Although China continues to build coal-fired power plants, it is rapidly adding renewable energy sources and says it will reach peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. We asked for a faster timetable and scientific exchanges for this purpose.

Scientists say the next pandemic is not a question of if, but when. Both governments mishandled COVID-19, and millions of people died. But rather than debate over who to blame, we suggested studying how our scientific cooperation helped slow SARS in 2003 and Ebola in 2014, and how we might apply these lessons in the future.\n\nRegarding nuclear weapons, the Chinese have defended their rapid development by arguing that intercontinental ballistic missiles are more precise and that the vulnerability of submarines could one day compromise their ability to retaliate if struck first. They reiterated their familiar objection to adopting arms control limitations before their arsenal matches that of the United States and Russia. But they expressed a willingness to discuss nuclear doctrine, concepts and strategic stability, as well as nonproliferation and difficult cases like North Korea and Iran, two areas in which America and China have cooperated in the past.\n\nThe fourth problem was artificial intelligence. In San Francisco last fall, Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to begin discussions on AI safety, even though their governments have yet to make much progress. Our group agreed that this issue also calls for private discussions behind closed doors, particularly on military technological applications. As one retired Chinese general said, arms control is unlikely, but there is a great opportunity to work toward mutual understanding of concepts and doctrine, and what it means to maintain human control.\n\nEconomically, both sides have agreed that bilateral trade is mutually beneficial, but the Chinese have complained about U.S. controls on advanced semiconductor exports. While the United States justifies its policy for security reasons, the Chinese see it as a measure intended to slow down their country's economic growth. Since U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has described the U.S. approach as building a high fence around a small construction site, we have emphasized that this only affects a small portion of our total trade. of chips.\n\nThe subject of Chinese industrial production overcapacity, fueled by subsidies, was more difficult. China's economic growth has slowed, and rather than taking steps to support its domestic consumption, it is trying to export its way out of its current problems (as it has done in the past). We emphasized that the world had changed since the Chinese shock at the beginning of the century.\n\nBut rather than agreeing to a decoupling that would be harmful to both parties, we agreed to divide economic issues into three categories. On one side were security issues, on which we agreed to disagree. At the other end was normal trade in goods and services, where we would follow the rules of international trade. And in the middle, where questions of subsidies and overcapacity arise, we would negotiate the issues on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOur last topic was people-to-people contacts, which have been seriously damaged by three years of COVID restrictions and deteriorating political relations. Fewer than 1,000 American students currently study in China, while some 289,000 Chinese study at American universities (although this figure is down by almost a quarter from its peak). Journalists face tighter visa restrictions in China, and academics and scientists on both sides report more hassle from immigration officials. None of this helps restore a sense of mutual understanding.\n\nIn this period of great power competition between the United States and China, we should not expect a return to the strategy of engagement that marked the beginning of this century. But it is in the interest of both countries to avoid conflict and identify areas of cooperation when and where possible.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

Our newly elected government also wants to work together (with India). We always promote peace and a friendly environment. Our people and the government will give a warm welcome to Indian arrivals. As the tourism minister, I want to tell Indians to please be a part of Maldives' tourism. Our economy depends on tourism,\" he said.\n\nA full-blown backlash was directed at the Maldives following derogatory remarks against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials after Modi posted photos and video of the pristine Lakshadweep Islands on India's west coast on 6 January on his X handle.\n\nScores of Indians, including multiple celebrities, cancelled their reservations and dropped plans to visit the Maldives. The tourism arrival statistics reflected how from being a top visitor country, India's position went down from topmost to sixth position after January.\n\nAccording to a sun.mv report published on Monday, the number of tourist arrivals from India declined by 42 percent in the first four months of this year,compared to the first four months of last year.\n\nAt the start of this year, India was the top tourist market for the Maldives. Shortly into the year, India dropped to sixth place among the top tourist markets, the news portal reported.\n\nAccording to tourism ministry statistics, the Maldives recorded a total of 43,991 tourist arrivals from India as of 4 May. Between January and April of last year, the Maldives recorded 73,785 tourist arrivals. This year, the number stands at 42,638.\n\nThe report attributed the steep decline in Indian tourists to the strained relations between India and the Maldives after the new administration led by President Mohamed Muizzu assumed office in November last year.\n\nThe India-Maldives ties have come under stress as President Muizzu, widely seen as a pro-China leader, maintained after assuming charge as the president in November that he will keep his election promise of evicting Indian military personnel from his country.\n\nSoon after coming to power, Muizzu forced the withdrawal of the 88 Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms gifted by India to the Maldives. He has previously accused India of meddling in the affairs of the Maldives and won the presidential elections in September last year with an \"India Out\" campaign.\n\nThe Maldives is India's key maritime neighbour in the Indian Ocean Region and occupies a special place in its initiatives like the 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the 'Neighbourhood First' policy' of the Modi government.

Tourism statistics showed a significant decline, with India's ranking dropping from the top to the sixth position after January.\n\nA sun.mv report published on Monday revealed a significant decline of 42 per cent in tourists from India visiting the country during the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year.\n\nTourism Ministry statistics indicate that as of May 4, the Maldives welcomed a total of 43,991 tourist arrivals from India, whereas during the same period last year, there were 73,785 arrivals, PTI reported.\n\nThe sharp drop in Indian tourists is because of the strained relations between India and the Maldives following the inauguration of pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu's new administration in November last year.\n\nMuizzu reiterated his election pledge to remove Indian military personnel from the country since taking office as president in November. Muizzu forced the withdrawal of 88 Indian military personnel stationed at three aviation platforms gifted by India.\n\nOn Friday, India and the Maldives reassessed the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Indian Ocean archipelago, a process insisted upon by Male to be completed by May 10. The fourth session of a bilateral high-level core group, responsible for supervising the substitution of Indian military personnel with civilian experts, took place in New Delhi.\n\nMuizzu has also accused India of interfering in Maldives' affairs. Following last year's presidential victory on an \"India Out\" plank, Muizzu, aligning more closely with China, designated May 10 as the cutoff date for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel.\n\nAdditionally, Muizzu has pursued measures to diminish the Maldives' reliance on India across various sectors, including maritime security, healthcare, and food security. He achieved this by sealing agreements with Sri Lanka, China, and Turkey for medical services, food supplies, and military equipment.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Island country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshadweep", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakshadweep"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lakshadweep"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/06/1600x900/The-new-president-of-the-Maldives--Mohamed-Muizzu-_1714751503299_1715011640884.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537372", "eventUri": "eng-9537372", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1195, "textEnd": 1200}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1997, "textEnd": 2003, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Between January and April of last year, Maldives recorded 73,785 tourist arrivals. This year, the number stands at 42,638.\n\nThe report attributed the steep decline in Indian tourists to the strained relations between India and the Maldives after the new administration led by President Mohamed Muizzu assumed office in November last year.\n\nThe India-Maldives ties have come under stress as President Muizzu, widely seen as a pro-China leader, maintained after assuming charge as the president in November that he will keep his election promise of evicting Indian military personnel from his country.\n\nSoon after coming to power, Muizzu forced the withdrawal of the 88 Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms gifted by India to the Maldives. He has previously accused India of meddling in the affairs of the Maldives and won the presidential elections in September last year with an ''India Out'' campaign.\n\nThe Maldives is India's key maritime neighbour in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and occupies a special place in its initiatives like 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the 'Neighbourhood First Policy' of the Modi government.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faisal of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshadweep", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakshadweep"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lakshadweep"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_units_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative units of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Armed Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_50_40_2945094.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537372", "eventUri": "eng-9537372", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 222, "textEnd": 227, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1236, "textEnd": 1245}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He has previously accused India of meddling in the affairs of the Maldives and won the presidential elections in September last year with an \"India Out\" campaign.\n\nThe Maldives is India's key maritime neighbour in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and occupies a special place in its initiatives like 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the 'Neighbourhood First Policy' of the Modi government.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shocker_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shocker (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faisal of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujrat,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujrat, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshadweep", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakshadweep"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lakshadweep"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_units_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative units of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Armed Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Latestly-World-News-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537372", "eventUri": "eng-9537372", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 12}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1142, "textEnd": 1151}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 2051, "textEnd": 2056}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Dr S Jaishankar and Minister Moosa held talks at the NAM summit in Kampala, discussing India's renewal of quotas for essential imports, reaffirming New Delhi's \"neighbourhood first policy\".\n\nTraditionally, Maldives' new governments visit India to affirm their \"India first\" policy, but President Muizzu's initial foreign visits included trips to Turkey, the UAE, and China, breaking from tradition.\n\nMeanwhile ...\n\nAt the fourth Meeting of the India-Maldives High-Level Core Group in New Delhi on May 3, 2024, discussions continued on various issues such as defence cooperation, development projects, trade, investment, and capacity building.\n\nThey also reviewed efforts to sustain Indian aviation platforms providing humanitarian and medical services in Maldives. The next meeting is expected to convene in Male soon.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "huma_siddiqui@financialexpress.com", "name": "Huma Siddiqui", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moosa_Zameer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moosa Zameer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

This was indeed a setback for India. Till then, India had a much greater influence on the archipelago than any other nation, including China.\n\nAs if that was not enough, in the parliamentary elections, called Majlis in Maldives, President Muizzu's People's National Congress (PNC) secured a landslide victory. It secured 66 seats on its own. Add to that nine of the party's allies which takes the tally to 75 out of 93 member house.\n\nIt gives President Muizzu enormous powers including rewriting the constitution if he wishes to do so! All these developments took place rather suddenly and unexpectedly. Muizzu was just a Mayor of the capital Male. He was not even in the presidential race.\n\nIt was only at the eleventh hour that he was drafted as a proxy when the leader of the opposition and the former President Abdulla Yameen, his mentor, was barred from contesting by the Supreme Court in a bribery related case. However, for all practical purposes elections were fought in the name of Yameen.\n\nThe posters, banners et al figured his name and face prominently. Even in the mass campaign meetings, seats at front and centre were kept vacant ostensibly for the jailed leader. Muizzu wooed voters with twin promises if elected- of releasing Yameen and vigorously pursuing 'India\n\nout' policy.\n\nAs happens quite often in politics, President elect Muizzu and Yameen fell out after presidential elections, which gave birth to a new party PNC. These setbacks on the one hand and on the other the opposition party MDP which possessed super majority in the outgoing parliament or Majlis appeared to be going strong.\n\nYet, the PNC won a landslide, perhaps an indication that anti-India feelings ran deep in Maldives. With MDP having a majority in Parliament, India still had a chance to retrieve its position. In fact, it did block certain proposals that were not in India's favour. President Muizzu now gets absolute power to see through\n\nall his plans.\n\nIn local parlance, this victory is termed super majority win. It is only the second time that such a feat has been achieved since the start of multi-party elections in 2009. The pro-India MDP won with a super majority (65 seats) in 2019 polls. However, this time around, MDP could barely win 12 seats.\n\nIt is a double whammy for India. Not just the loss of MDP in polls but the margin of victory of PNC is cause for concern. President Muizzu has made no secret of his inclination towards China. He broke the age-old tradition ('India first') of the new President's first visit which would be to India. Instead, not only did he choose to go to China, but also returned with a bag full of bilateral agreements.\n\nAs promised, he has succeeded in negotiating and replacing 80 odd Indian military men with civilians stationed in Maldives. He has also brought three drones from Turkey in a bid to replace India donated aircrafts to patrol the vast maritime boundary of Maldives.\n\nA civil engineer himself, he seems to be interested in exploring infrastructure projects with aid and assistance from China. Earlier he worked as Construction Minister under Yameen overseeing several Chinese funded projects including a $200 million bridge that connects Male with the main airport.\n\nMaldives economy is already in financial distress. The IMF has warned it about the impending crisis with total foreign debts of $3.99 billion. Debt is now 113% of the nation's GDP. It has called for urgent policy adjustments. Already China accounts for 53% of public and guaranteed external loans.\n\nIndia is also a major creditor accounting for the other half of Maldives debt. There is every indication that Maldives may go in for more infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, which critics including western nations led by the U.S have termed as 'debt trap'.\n\nSuch apprehensions are not without reason. Sri Lanka signed several infrastructure projects with China and its debts swelled leading to sovereign default in April 2022. India did rescue the southern neighbour. Only much later did China pitch in with an offer of restructuring some of its long term loans.\n\nThe author has four decades\n\nof experience in higher education teaching and research.

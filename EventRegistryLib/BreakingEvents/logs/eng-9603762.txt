On Tuesday, Kajol shared a brief clip on Instagram.\n\nRead More: New K-Dramas Coming to Netflix in June 2024: From 'Hierarchy' to the Unscripted Series 'Agents of Mystery' and More\n\nThe video begins with a person running on a runway while Prabhudeva chases him with a bat. It also introduces Naseeruddin Shah and Samyuktha Menon. Later, Kajol is seen delivering her lines while beating up goons. Dressed in a red outfit, she thrashes them with a sword, saying, \"Power maang k nahi, cheen ke lee jaate hai (Power isn't received by asking but by wresting it).\"\n\nSharing the video, Kajol wrote, \"So kicked to share this with you guys .. #Maharagni.. aka Queen of Queens. Take a moment and have fun! Hope u guys like it. Directed by @tej_uppalapati.\"\n\nThe action-thriller film marks the reunion of Kajol and Prabhudeva 27 years after Rajiv Menon's \"Minsaara Kanavu\" (1997). The cast also includes Naseeruddin Shah, Samyuktha Menon, Jisshu Sengupta, and Aditya Seal.\n\nThe first schedule of the film, directed by Charan Tej Uppalapati, has been completed.

The screenplay is by Niranjan Iyengar and Jessica Khurana. The film is produced by Harman Baweja and Venkata Anish Dorigillu under the labels Baweja Studios and E7 Entertainments, respectively.\n\nTips Official on its YouTube channel described the film as, \"an explosive cocktail of intense drama, raw emotions, and mind-blowing action sequences that will leave you on the edge of your seat.\"\n\nUppalapati said: \"It has been an exhilarating journey bringing 'Maharagni - Queen of Queens' to life in front of the camera. Collaborating with stalwarts like Kajol, Prabhu Deva, Naseer-sir, Samyuktha Menon and Jisshu Sen Gupta for my Hindi debut has been a dream come true.

At Baweja Studios, we are dedicated to telling powerful stories, and we are excited to share this journey with a global audience.\"\n\nDorigillu said: \"The moment I came across this story, I knew it had to be told. What better way to bring it to the masses than with a stellar cast like Kajol, Prabhudeva, and Naseeruddin Shah? Working with director Charan Tej Uppalapati has been an incredible experience, and his vision has truly brought this story to life.\"\n\n\"Maharagni - Queen of Queens\" is crafted as a pan-India film and will be released in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam.\n\nHistorically, India's cinema markets have been segmented by geography and language, with limited crossover between them, except for Bollywood (Hindi-language) films, which have enjoyed broader releases. However, this landscape is evolving.\n\nThe term pan-India film typically refers to movies made in one of the four South Indian languages -- Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam -- which are then dubbed into Hindi and other languages and released nationwide and in overseas diaspora markets.\n\nKajol is set to lead the upcoming Netflix mystery thriller \"Do Patti,\" which is yet to begin shooting. \"It's going to be very, very interesting and I hope and pray that you all find it as interesting because it's very different from what I've done so far,\" Kajol said.\n\nAdditionally, she

The team is now gearing up to unveil a sneak peek of the film in the near future.\n\nIn a bid to bring their grand vision to life, the creators of this ambitious project have enlisted the acclaimed cinematographer GK Vishnu, known for his work on 'Jawan,' and the talented editor Navin Nooli, who also worked on 'Pushpa 2.' The screenplay is penned by Niranjan Iyengar and Jessica Khurana, with Saahi Suresh set to elevate the visual appeal as the production designer. The music for this film will be orchestrated by Harshavardhan Rameshwar, celebrated for his work on 'Animal' directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga.

Its Hindi-dubbed adaptation, \"Sapnay,\" introduced to the masses the beloved track \"Chanda Re.\"\n\nThe narrative delves into the life of Priya, a young girl studying in a convent school with dreams of embracing a life as a nun.

Prabhu exudes gangster-like charisma, while Menon revs up in an underground race. Yet, it's Kajol's electrifying entry, set against the bright red hues of Durga Puja, effortlessly defeating foes, that steals the spotlight. Currently, the storyline remains shrouded in mystery. Notably, the film is backed by Harman Baweja and Venkata Anish Dorigillu.\n\nCharan Tej Uppalapati is directing the film, marking his debut in Hindi cinema. The crew includes GK Vishnu as the director of photography, composer Harshavardhan Rameshwar, production designer Saahi Suresh, and editor Navin Nooli. The screenplay is written by Niranjan Iyengar and Jessica Khurana. Uppalapati expressed his excitement about the project saying, \"It has been an exhilarating journey bringing Maharagni to life in front of the camera.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Hyderabad Times, Uppalapati shared his anticipation for the on-screen reunion of Kajol and Deva after nearly three decades. He revealed that the film would highlight issues such as children settling abroad neglecting their parents and seeking their property later. Uppalapati added that Shah plays a very important role while Menon's role will be very different from anything she's done so far in Telugu and Tamil cinema.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Durga Puja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhu_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prabhu (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harman_Baweja", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harman Baweja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harsha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vishnu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_(composer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deva (composer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niranjan_Iyengar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niranjan Iyengar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telugu language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l98320240528135947.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603762", "eventUri": "eng-9603762", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}
